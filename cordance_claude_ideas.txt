USE CASE 5: SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH IDENTIFICATION AND COMMUNITY RESOURCE LINKAGE

Clinical Scenario

A 44-year-old patient with uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension presents for follow-up. Despite appropriate medications, HbA1c is 10.2% and BP is 168/98. The physician suspects medication non-adherence but doesn't have time to explore underlying social barriers like food insecurity, housing instability, or transportation challenges that may be root causes.

Current State Challenges

Social determinants of health (SDOH) rarely systematically assessed in primary care

Physicians lack time to explore complex social needs in brief visits

Even when SDOH needs identified, physicians often don't know what community resources available

Referral to community resources (food banks, transportation, housing) is ad hoc and inefficient

Transportation barriers prevent medication pickup and appointment attendance

Food insecurity makes diabetes management nearly impossible

Medication costs are prohibitive but financial assistance programs underutilized

Health literacy barriers prevent effective self-management

No systematic tracking of SDOH interventions and outcomes

Cordance Solution

BEFORE ENCOUNTER:

Automated SDOH screening using validated tools:

PRAPARE (Protocol for Responding to and Assessing Patient Assets, Risks, and Experiences)

AHC (Accountable Health Communities) screening tool

Can be administered by MA/nurse before physician encounter or via patient portal pre-visit

Identifies needs in domains:

Food insecurity

Housing instability

Transportation challenges

Utility needs

Interpersonal safety

Financial strain

Social isolation

Flags patients with positive screens for physician attention

Integrates with ZIP code-specific community resource database

DURING ENCOUNTER:

SDOH dashboard displays:

Positive screening results with severity

Impact on current health conditions (e.g., food insecurity affecting diabetes control)

Available community resources by need type:

* Food banks and meal programs

* Transportation services (public transit, ride-sharing, medical transport)

* Housing assistance programs

* Utility assistance

* Financial counseling and benefits enrollment (SNAP, Medicaid, CHIP)

* Medication assistance programs (manufacturer co-pay programs, 340B pharmacies)

* Health literacy resources and medical interpreters

* Mental health and substance use treatment resources

Provides one-click referrals to community resources

Generates warm handoffs to community health workers or care coordinators

Identifies clinical implications:

Medication non-adherence likely due to cost → switch to $4 generics or enroll in assistance program

Missed appointments likely due to transportation → set up ride-sharing or telehealth

Poor glucose control likely due to food insecurity → refer to diabetes-appropriate meal program

Offers culturally-appropriate patient education materials in preferred language

AFTER ENCOUNTER:

Submits electronic referrals to community resources with closed-loop tracking

Enrolls patient in medication assistance programs automatically

Schedules transportation for future appointments

Connects to community health worker for SDOH navigation

Prescribes "food as medicine" programs if available (medically-tailored meals)

Arranges telehealth visits to overcome transportation barriers

Provides simplified medication regimen and switches to low-cost generics

Sets up medication synchronization and delivery to home if transportation challenge

Triggers social work consultation for complex needs

Enrolls in financial counseling for medical debt or benefits enrollment

Impact on Three Pillars

ECONOMICS:

Reduces ED visits and hospitalizations from uncontrolled chronic disease (saves $8K-$25K per hospitalization)

Improves medication adherence preventing disease progression

Decreases no-show rates through transportation support (each no-show costs practice $200-$300)

Reduces healthcare utilization through addressing root causes of poor health

Qualifies for SDOH screening quality bonuses in value-based contracts

Estimated impact: $120K-$180K saved per 100 high-need patients through hospitalization and ED visit reduction

QUALITY & SAFETY:

Improves chronic disease control (diabetes, hypertension) by addressing adherence barriers

Reduces disparities by identifying and addressing social needs

Improves medication adherence by 30-50% through cost assistance and home delivery

Decreases appointment no-show rates by 40-60% through transportation support

Enhances patient-physician relationship through holistic care

Identifies safety concerns (intimate partner violence, unsafe housing)

POPULATION HEALTH & OUTCOMES:

Systematic SDOH screening across entire patient population

Addresses root causes of health disparities (food insecurity, housing, transportation)

Connects patients to community resources improving overall wellbeing

Reduces social isolation through connection to community programs

Enables population-level monitoring of social needs and resource utilization

Shifts paradigm from "sick care" to true healthcare addressing social determinants

Estimated impact: 20-35% improvement in chronic disease control in patients with SDOH needs addressed
