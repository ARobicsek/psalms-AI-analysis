Therefore, stating that YHWH *is* a \"מִשְׂגָּב\" involves a cross-domain comparison where a divine entity is likened to a physical place of refuge. This is a clear metaphor.

While \"YHWH\" is not explicitly repeated, the grammatical structure implies that YHWH is still the subject of this second \"מִשְׂגָּב.\" It reinforces the metaphorical comparison of YHWH to a protective stronghold, specifically emphasizing this role during periods of distress. Thus, it continues the same metaphor.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None; it's a direct continuation of the initial metaphor.\n\nBased on this analysis, the core figurative element is the metaphor of YHWH as a \"מִשְׂגָּב\" (haven/stronghold).",

Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n2.  **סַ֥לְעִ֥י (my crag):** I considered this as a metaphor. God is not a literal physical crag. The comparison is made to highlight God's protective, unyielding, and secure nature. This is a clear cross-domain comparison. Therefore, it is marked as a metaphor.\n\n3.  **וּמְצוּדָתִ֗י (my fortress):** Similar to \"my crag,\" God is not a literal physical fortress. This is a metaphor comparing God to a defensive structure, emphasizing His role as a secure refuge and protector. This is a clear cross-domain comparison. Therefore, it is marked as a metaphor.\n\n4.  **וּמְפַ֫לְטִ֥י (my rescuer):** I considered if this might be figurative. However, the instructions state: \"NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Comparisons of role or function.\" \"My rescuer\" describes God's direct role and function in the speaker's life. It is a literal description of God's action. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n5.  **אֵלִ֣י (my God):** This is a direct identification of God. It is a literal statement of relationship. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n6.  **צ֭וּרִי (my rock):** Similar to \"my crag,\" God is not a literal physical rock. This is a metaphor comparing God to a rock, signifying stability, strength, and a firm foundation. This is a clear cross-domain comparison. Therefore, it is marked as a metaphor.\n\n7.  **אֶֽחֱסֶה־בּ֑וֹ (in whom I seek refuge):** This describes the speaker's action and relationship with God. It is a literal statement of trust and dependence. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n8.  **מָֽגִנִּ֥י (my shield):** God is not a literal physical shield. This is a metaphor comparing God to a defensive weapon, emphasizing His protective power against harm. This is a clear cross-domain comparison. Therefore, it is marked as a metaphor.\n\n9.  **וְקֶֽרֶן־יִ֝שְׁעִ֗י (my horn of rescue):** I considered this as both a metaphor and an idiom. A \"horn\" (קרן) in biblical literature is a well-established symbol of strength, power, and salvation/deliverance. God is not a literal horn. The phrase \"horn of salvation/rescue\" is a recognized biblical idiom that functions metaphorically. It clearly involves a cross-domain comparison (God's power to an animal's horn or a symbol of strength). Therefore, it is marked as both a metaphor and an idiom.\n\n10. **מִשְׂגַּבִּֽי (my haven / my stronghold):** The Hebrew מִשְׂגָּב (misgav) means \"high place, stronghold, refuge.\" God is not a literal physical high place or stronghold. This is a metaphor comparing God to a secure, elevated place of safety, emphasizing His role as a protector and refuge. This is a clear cross-domain comparison.

This constitutes a clear cross-domain comparison where God (a divine entity) is identified with \"strength\" (an abstract concept of power and protection). This identification highlights His role as the ultimate source of power, protection, and sustenance for His people. It is not a literal physical description, nor is it merely a comparison of role or function (like \"a prophet like myself\"). This fits the definition of a clear metaphor.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** One might argue it's a statement of divine attribute, but the direct identification implied by the copula (even if unstated in Hebrew) elevates it beyond simple attribution to a metaphorical equation.\n\n2.  **Phrase/Concept:** וּמָ֘ע֤וֹז (and a stronghold) in the clause וּמָ֘ע֤וֹז יְשׁוּע֖וֹת מְשִׁיח֣וֹ הֽוּא (and a stronghold for the deliverance of His anointed is He).\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if \"stronghold\" (מָעוֹז) when applied to God is a literal description, an anthropomorphism, or a metaphor.\n    *   **Reasoning for including it as metaphor:** God is not a physical, fortified structure. A \"stronghold\" is a tangible, defensive edifice designed for protection and security. Likening God (an immaterial, divine being) to a physical \"stronghold\" is a direct cross-domain comparison. The purpose of this comparison is to convey God's protective, secure, and unassailable nature, emphasizing that He provides refuge and safety for His anointed. This is a clear metaphor. It does not refer to God's body, nor is it an idiom that isn't also fundamentally metaphorical.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None. This is a very common and unambiguous metaphor in biblical literature.",

Reasoning: This is a standard declaration of praise and worship, a literal statement of blessing God. It does not involve a cross-domain comparison, exaggeration, or non-literal meaning. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n*   **\"כִּ֥י הִפְלִ֘יא־חַסְדּ֥וֹ לִ֝֗י\" (for He has been wondrously faithful to me):** I considered if \"wondrously faithful\" (הִפְלִיא חַסְדּוֹ) could be hyperbole or a metaphor. Reasoning: \"הִפְלִיא\" means \"to make wonderful,\" \"to do a wonder,\" or \"to be extraordinary.\" It describes the exceptional nature and degree of God's faithfulness, but it is a literal description of an extraordinary divine act or quality, not an exaggeration beyond belief or a comparison to something else. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n*   **\"בְּעִ֣יר מָצֽוֹר\" (bəʿîr māṣôr - in a city of siege / a veritable bastion):**\n    *   **Initial Consideration:** I first considered if this phrase could be a literal statement of location, meaning God showed faithfulness to the speaker *while the speaker was physically in a besieged city*.\n    *   **Reasoning for Exclusion of Literal Location:** While grammatically possible, the immediate context—praise for God's *wondrous faithfulness to the speaker*—suggests that \"בְּעִ֣יר מָצֽוֹר\" describes the *nature* or *effect* of that faithfulness, rather than merely a circumstantial location. If it were a literal location, one might expect more narrative detail about the speaker's situation.\n    *   **Reasoning for Inclusion as Metaphor:** The Hebrew term \"מָצוֹר\" (matsor) can mean \"siege\" but also \"fortification,\" \"bulwark,\" or \"stronghold.\" Thus, \"עִיר מָצוֹר\" can be interpreted not just as a \"city under siege\" (a place of vulnerability) but also as a \"fortified city\" or \"stronghold\" (a place of defense and security). In this context of praising God's wondrous faithfulness, the latter interpretation is far more fitting. The phrase then functions as a metaphor where God's abstract quality of faithfulness is directly identified with or compared to a concrete, protective structure—a fortified city or bastion. The preposition \"בְּ\" (bə) here can be understood as indicating the *manner* or *nature* of God's faithfulness, effectively meaning \"as a fortified city\" or \"as a bastion.\" This is a clear cross-domain comparison (abstract divine attribute to concrete architectural structure) to convey strength, protection, and reliability.

A stronghold (מָעוּז) is literally a fortified place, a refuge, or a source of physical strength and protection.\n    *   **Reasoning**: God is not a literal physical fortress or building. By calling God \"my stronghold,\" the speaker is making a direct cross-domain comparison, likening God to a physical structure that provides security, defense, and refuge. The quality being highlighted is God's protective nature and the security He provides.

The verb קָדַר (qadar) means to be dark, gloomy, or mournful.\n    *   **Reasoning**: The speaker is not literally walking *inside* a physical substance called \"gloom.\" Instead, \"walking in gloom\" is a metaphorical expression describing the speaker's pervasive emotional state of deep sadness, distress, or mourning. The physical act of \"walking\" is used to convey the continuous experience of this internal, gloomy state.

The Hebrew `עֻזּוֹ` literally means \"His strength,\" but the provided English translation interprets it as a vocative address to God, identifying God as the speaker's strength.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** By addressing God as \"my strength,\" the speaker is not literally stating that God is a physical force or muscle. Instead, God is being equated with the abstract concept of strength, implying that God is the source, embodiment, and provider of the speaker's power, resilience, and ability to endure. This is a clear cross-domain comparison where an abstract quality (strength) is used as a direct identifier for God, making it a metaphor. It is not a comparison of role or function, but an identification.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** The primary debate here is the interpretation of `עֻזּוֹ` itself (His strength vs. My strength/O my strength). However, given the explicit English translation \"O my strength\" provided for analysis, the metaphorical reading is strongly supported.\n\n2.  **Phrase/Concept:** `אֵלֶ֣יךָ אֶשְׁמֹ֑רָה` (I wait for You)\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if \"waiting for God\" could be interpreted figuratively, perhaps as personification or an idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** \"Waiting for God\" is a standard biblical expression denoting expectation, trust, and reliance on God's intervention or provision. While it describes a spiritual and mental posture rather than a literal physical act of waiting in a specific location, it is a conventional and non-figurative way to express a common religious attitude. It does not involve a cross-domain comparison, personification of a non-human entity, or an obscure idiomatic meaning beyond its direct sense of hopeful anticipation and dependence.\n\n3.  **Phrase/Concept:** `אֱלֹהִ֗ים מִשְׂגַּבִּֽי` (God is my haven)\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if identifying God as a \"haven\" is a metaphor.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** A \"haven\" (`מִשְׂגָּב`) literally refers to a high, inaccessible place, a stronghold, or a refuge that provides physical protection from enemies or danger. God is not a physical structure, a geographical location, or a literal fortress. By calling God \"my haven,\" the speaker is comparing God to a physical place of ultimate safety and security, implying that God provides protection, refuge, and defense in times of trouble.

They do not involve a clear cross-domain comparison that would classify them as a metaphor or simile, nor do they represent a non-literal meaning beyond the conventional usage of praise. Given the instruction to be conservative with \"standard narrative language\" and \"biblical idioms and set phrases\" unless they are \"figurative idioms\" with a clear non-literal meaning, these are considered standard expressions of praise rather than figurative language. Therefore, I will not mark them as figurative.\n\n*   **\"כִּֽי־הָיִ֣יתָ מִשְׂגָּ֣ב לִ֑י\" (for You have been my haven / stronghold):**\n    *   **Considered:** If \"מִשְׂגָּ֣ב\" (misgav, haven/stronghold) is a metaphor for God.\n    *   **Reasoning:** God is not literally a physical fortress, high place, or stronghold. The text uses a concrete, physical structure known for providing security, defense, and protection (a stronghold/haven) to describe God's abstract role and character as a source of safety and security for the speaker. This is a clear cross-domain comparison (divine being vs. physical structure) where God is implicitly likened to a stronghold. Therefore, it is a metaphor.\n\n*   **\"וּ֝מָנ֗וֹס בְּי֣וֹם צַר־לִֽי\" (a refuge in time of trouble):**\n    *   **Considered:** If \"מָנ֗וֹס\" (manos, refuge/place of escape) is a metaphor for God.\n    *   **Reasoning:** Similar to \"misgav,\" God is not literally a physical place of refuge or escape. The text employs the image of a physical location that offers safety and escape from danger (a refuge) to describe God's abstract function and character as a provider of safety and deliverance during times of distress. This is another clear cross-domain comparison (divine being vs. physical location) where God is implicitly likened to a refuge. Therefore, it is a metaphor.",

The term \"haven\" or \"stronghold\" (מִשְׂגָּב) is used to describe the protective qualities God provides. God acts *like* a haven, offering security and refuge, but is directly identified *as* the haven.

Physical highways/roads cannot literally exist in human hearts. This is a metaphor where the heart (mind/inner being) is conceptualized as containing paths or roads, likely referring to the pilgrim roads to Jerusalem being internalized as spiritual pathways or desires. The vehicle is physical highways, the target is mental/spiritual orientation, and the ground is the directed movement toward a destination.\n\nBoth phrases 2 and 3 contain figurative language that should be included in the [TRUNCATION DETECTED DESPITE FALLBACK]",

I considered if this might be a metaphor. God is not a literal physical structure or place of shelter. The term \"refuge\" (מַחְסֶה) typically refers to a physical place of safety from danger or pursuit. Applying this term to God, who is an incorporeal divine being, constitutes a cross-domain comparison. The speaker is likening God's protective function to that of a physical refuge. Therefore, I am including this as a metaphor.\n\nSimilarly, I considered \"וּמְצוּדָתִ֑י\" (and stronghold). I considered if this might be a metaphor. A \"stronghold\" (מְצוּדָה) is a fortified place, a fortress, offering defense and security. Like \"refuge,\" this is a physical entity. Attributing this quality to God, who is not a physical structure, is a clear cross-domain comparison. God provides defense and security *like* a stronghold. Therefore, I am including this as a metaphor.\n\nFinally, I considered \"אֱ֝לֹהַ֗י אֶבְטַח־בּֽוֹ\" (my God in whom I trust). This is a direct statement of faith and relationship with God.

Instead, God's protective nature and provision of security are being compared to the function of a physical refuge or shelter. This is a clear cross-domain comparison: the abstract concept of divine protection is understood through the concrete image of a physical place of safety.

However, \"faithful one\" (from חֶסֶד, steadfast love/faithfulness) is a direct descriptor of God's inherent character and relationship with the speaker. It attributes a core quality to God rather than comparing God to something from a different domain. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n2.  **וּמְצוּדָתִי֮ / my fortress**: I considered this phrase as a potential metaphor. A fortress is a physical, defensive structure. God is not a literal, physical fortress. The speaker is using the image of a fortress to describe God's role as a source of protection, security, and defense. This is a clear cross-domain comparison, where God (an abstract, divine entity) is likened to a physical structure. This is a metaphor.\n3.  **מִשְׂגַּבִּ֢י / my haven**: I considered this phrase as a potential metaphor. מִשְׂגָּב (misgav) means a high place, stronghold, or refuge. Similar to \"fortress,\" a haven or stronghold is a physical place of safety and refuge. God is not a literal physical haven or stronghold. The speaker is comparing God's role as a source of safety, refuge, and security to a physical place of shelter. This is a clear cross-domain comparison. This is a metaphor.\n4.  **וּֽמְפַלְטִ֫י־לִ֥י / and my deliverer**: I considered if \"deliverer\" is figurative. This term directly describes God's action and function as one who rescues or saves. It is a literal description of God's role and activity, not a comparison to something else. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n5.  **מָ֭גִנִּי / my shield**: I considered this phrase as a potential metaphor. A shield is a physical object used for protection in battle. God is not a literal, physical shield. The speaker is using the image of a shield to describe God's role as a protector and defender. This is a clear cross-domain comparison, where God (an abstract, divine entity) is likened to a physical object. This is a metaphor.\n6.  **וּב֣וֹ חָסִ֑יתִי / in whom I take shelter**: I considered if \"take shelter\" is figurative. While \"taking shelter\" can be a physical act, here it describes the speaker's act of trusting and seeking refuge in God. This is a literal description of the speaker's reliance and faith, which is the *ground* for the preceding metaphors of God as a fortress, haven, and shield. It describes the speaker's response to God's protective nature, rather than being a figurative comparison itself. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n7.  **הָרוֹדֵ֖ד עַמִּ֣י תַחְתָּֽי / who makes peoples subject to me**: I considered if this description of God's action is figurative. This phrase describes a literal act of subjugation or making peoples subservient, often attributed to God working through a king. It is a direct statement of power and control, not a figurative comparison or personification. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.",

            "detection": "I examined each phrase in the provided text for potential figurative language.\n\n1.  **\"הַ֥לְלוּ־יָ֨הּ\" (Hallelujah):** I considered if this exclamation of praise might be an idiom or a form of figurative language. However, \"Hallelujah\" is a direct imperative (\"Praise Yah\") and a literal call to worship. It functions as a direct command and an expression of adoration, not a figurative comparison or an indirect statement. Therefore, I excluded it.\n\n2.  **\"הַֽלְלוּ־אֵ֥ל\" (Praise God):** Similar to the above, this is a direct command to praise God. It is a literal instruction and expression of worship. I excluded it.\n\n3.  **\"בְּקׇדְשׁ֑וֹ\" (in His sanctuary):** I considered if \"sanctuary\" might be used metaphorically for God's presence rather than a physical place. However, \"sanctuary\" (קֹדֶשׁ) can refer to a literal sacred space (like the Temple) or a spiritual realm of holiness. In the ANE context, the concept of a divine sanctuary, whether earthly or heavenly, was understood literally as a dwelling place or sphere of divine activity. There is no clear cross-domain comparison here that would make it figurative. I excluded it.\n\n4.  **\"הַֽ֝לְל֗וּהוּ\" (praise Him):** This is another direct command, a literal instruction. I excluded it.\n\n5.  **\"בִּרְקִ֥יעַ עֻזּֽוֹ\" (in the sky, His stronghold):**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if \"sky, His stronghold\" is a metaphor. The Hebrew word עֹז (oz) means strength, might, or power, and by extension, can refer to a place of strength or a stronghold.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** The \"sky\" (רָקִיעַ) is not literally a fortified building or a physical stronghold with walls and defenses. By describing the sky as God's \"stronghold,\" the text is making a cross-domain comparison. It likens the vast, powerful, and seemingly impregnable expanse of the heavens, where God's might is displayed, to a human-made fortress or a place of ultimate security and power. This is a clear conceptual mapping from the domain of human architecture/military defense to the celestial realm and divine power. It emphasizes God's immense strength, security, and majesty by using a concrete, familiar image. This fits the definition of a metaphor.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** One might argue that \"עֻזּֽוֹ\" simply means \"His strength\" and the sky is where His strength is *manifested*, making it less figurative. However, the construct \"רְקִיעַ עֻזּוֹ\" (sky of His strength/stronghold) strongly implies that the sky *itself* functions as or is perceived as His stronghold. The English translation \"His stronghold\" captures this metaphorical sense well. The sky is not literally a stronghold, but it *is* a stronghold in a figurative sense, representing God's unassailable power and dominion.",
