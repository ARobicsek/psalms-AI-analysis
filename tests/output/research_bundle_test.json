My reasoning for including it as figurative is that \"goodness\" and \"steadfast love\" are abstract concepts, yet they are attributed the action of \"pursuing\" (יִרְדְּפוּנִי), which is typically performed by living, active agents (people or animals). This is a clear cross-domain comparison where abstract qualities are given human-like agency, thus qualifying as personification.\n\nI considered \"כׇּל־יְמֵ֣י חַיָּ֑י\" (all the days of my life). I reasoned that this is a standard temporal phrase indicating duration throughout one's entire life. It is a literal statement of time and not a figurative idiom or metaphor.\n\nI considered \"וְשַׁבְתִּ֥י בְּבֵית־יְ֝הֹוָ֗ה\" (and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD). I considered if \"house of the LORD\" could be a metaphor for God's spiritual presence or protection, rather than the literal Temple. However, given the conservative instructions to treat standard narrative language and biblical idioms/set phrases literally unless they refer to God's body, and recognizing that \"house of the LORD\" is a well-established term for the physical Temple in Jerusalem, which was considered the literal dwelling place of God's presence in the ANE context, I decided to exclude it as figurative. While the *experience* of dwelling there implies spiritual communion, the phrase itself refers to a concrete, physical location.\n\nI considered \"לְאֹ֣רֶךְ יָמִֽים\" (for many long years). I considered if this might be hyperbole or an idiom. My reasoning for excluding it as figurative is that this is a common Hebrew expression denoting a long, indefinite period or perpetuity. It is a literal statement of extended duration, not an exaggeration meant to be understood non-literally, nor an idiom with a meaning distinct from its constituent words.\n\nTherefore, only the personification of goodness and steadfast love pursuing the speaker is marked as figurative.",

            "detection": "1.  **מִזְמ֥וֹר לְדָוִ֑ד (A psalm of David):**\n    *   **Considered:** If this phrase might contain any figurative elements.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a literal superscription, indicating authorship or dedication. It is not figurative.\n\n2.  **יְהֹוָ֥ה רֹ֝עִ֗י (The LORD is my shepherd):**\n    *   **Considered:** If this is a metaphor, simile, personification, idiom, or anthropomorphism.\n    *   **Reasoning:**\n        *   **Metaphor:** This is a clear metaphor. The LORD, a divine being, is directly identified with a human occupation (a shepherd) without using a comparative particle like \"like\" or \"as.\" This creates a cross-domain comparison where the qualities of a shepherd (guidance, protection, provision, care) are attributed to God.\n        *   **Simile:** It is not a simile because it lacks a comparative particle (e.g., \"The LORD is *like* my shepherd\").\n        *   **Personification:** It is not personification because a shepherd is already a human entity; rather, a divine entity is being compared to a human role.\n        *   **Idiom:** While \"God as shepherd\" is a common biblical image, the phrase itself is not an idiom in the sense of a fixed expression whose meaning is entirely non-literal or culturally specific in a way that obscures its component parts (like \"mouth of the sword\"). The meaning is derived directly from the metaphorical identification.\n        *   **Divine Anthropomorphism:** The prompt states that divine anthropomorphisms (e.g., God went, God was angry) are literal unless they refer to God's body. However, \"The LORD is my shepherd\" is not describing God *doing* a human action or expressing a human emotion, but rather *being* or *identifying* as a human role. The prompt also states that \"Comparisons of role or function, such as 'a prophet like myself' (כָּמֹנִי) or 'a prophet like yourself' (כָּמוֹךָ)\" are literal. Crucially, these examples use the comparative particle \"like.\" In contrast, \"The LORD *is* my shepherd\" is a direct identification (\"X is Y\"), which is the hallmark of a metaphor, not a \"like\" comparison. Therefore, despite being a comparison of role/function, the direct identification makes it a metaphor rather than a literal statement of equivalence.\n    *   **Borderline Cases:** The instruction regarding \"Comparisons of role or function\" was carefully considered. The key distinction is that the prompt's examples for literal comparisons of role/function use \"like\" (כָּמֹנִי, כָּמוֹךָ). The phrase \"יְהֹוָ֥ה רֹ֝עִ֗י\" (The LORD *is* my shepherd) does not use \"like,\" but rather directly equates the LORD with a shepherd. This direct identification is the defining characteristic of a metaphor, making it distinct from the \"literal statements of equivalence or similarity in function\" described in the \"NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE\" section, which explicitly refer to \"like\" comparisons.\n\n3.  **לֹ֣א אֶחְסָֽר (I lack nothing):**\n    *   **Considered:** If this statement of outcome might be hyperbole or another figurative type.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a literal statement of the consequence of the LORD being the speaker's shepherd. It expresses complete provision and satisfaction, but it is a direct, factual claim within the context of the speaker's experience of divine care, not an exaggeration or other figurative device.",

The verb describes a direct action upon this internal state. It is not a cross-domain comparison where one thing is explicitly likened to another. It describes a profound internal or spiritual restoration directly, rather than figuratively. Therefore, I excluded it as a distinct figurative element.\n\n2.  **יַֽנְחֵ֥נִי בְמַעְגְּלֵי־צֶ֝֗דֶק (He guides me in right paths):**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if \"בְמַעְגְּלֵי־צֶ֝֗דֶק\" (in right paths) constitutes a metaphor.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The term \"מַעְגְּלֵי\" (paths/tracks) is clearly used metaphorically here. Physical paths (the vehicle) are employed to represent a course of conduct, a way of life, or moral direction (the target). This is a classic cross-domain comparison where a physical journey represents a moral or spiritual journey. The qualification \"צֶ֝֗דֶק\" (righteousness) further solidifies its metaphorical use for ethical living. Therefore, I included this as a metaphor.\n\n3.  **לְמַ֣עַן שְׁמֽוֹ (as befits His name/for His name's sake):**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if \"שְׁמֽוֹ\" (His name) is a metonymy and if the entire phrase is an idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning:** In biblical Hebrew, \"שֵׁם\" (name) frequently serves as a metonymy for the person, character, reputation, or honor of an individual, especially God. The phrase \"לְמַ֣עַן שְׁמֽוֹ\" (for His name's sake) is a well-established biblical idiom signifying \"for the sake of His glory, character, or reputation.\" It is a common set phrase that uses metonymy.

I concluded it is metaphorical. The entire psalm employs overarching metaphors for God's care (shepherd, and now host). A shepherd does not literally set a banquet table for a sheep. This imagery shifts to portray God as a gracious and powerful host. The \"table\" is not a piece of furniture but a symbol of lavish provision, security, and public vindication. The action of setting the table is an anthropomorphism, but it occurs within a non-literal, metaphorical scene. Therefore, the entire clause is part of a larger metaphor.\n\n- **`דִּשַּׁ֥נְתָּ בַשֶּׁ֥מֶן רֹ֝אשִׁ֗י` (You anoint my head with oil):** I considered this as a literal anointing. However, it is an integral part of the banquet metaphor established in the previous clause. Anointing a guest's head with oil was a customary act of honor and hospitality in the Ancient Near East. Here, it is not a physical act but a metaphorical depiction of God bestowing honor, joy, and blessing upon the psalmist as a cherished guest.\n\n- **`כּוֹסִ֥י רְוָיָֽה` (my cup is overflowing / my drink is abundant):** I considered if this refers to a literal, overflowing cup. I determined it is metaphorical. The \"cup\" (`כּוֹס`) is a common biblical symbol for one's lot, destiny, or experience. Within the banquet scene, the overflowing cup represents the superabundance of God's blessings in the psalmist's life. It is the culminating image of the host's boundless generosity. While it has metonymic qualities (cup for its contents/blessings), its primary function is to complete the extended metaphor of the divine host.\n\n- **Overall Assessment:** The entire verse functions as a single, coherent, and extended metaphor. It shifts the psalm's controlling image from God as a shepherd to God as a host. Each clause contributes to this central metaphor of a divine banquet, which symbolizes God's provision, protection, honor, and abundant blessing. I will therefore mark the entire verse as one instance of metaphor.",

            "detection": "1.  **מִזְמ֥וֹר לְדָוִ֑ד (A psalm of David):**\n    *   **Considered:** If this phrase might contain any figurative elements.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a literal superscription, indicating authorship or dedication. It is not figurative.\n\n2.  **יְהֹוָ֥ה רֹ֝עִ֗י (The LORD is my shepherd):**\n    *   **Considered:** If this is a metaphor, simile, personification, idiom, or anthropomorphism.\n    *   **Reasoning:**\n        *   **Metaphor:** This is a clear metaphor. The LORD, a divine being, is directly identified with a human occupation (a shepherd) without using a comparative particle like \"like\" or \"as.\" This creates a cross-domain comparison where the qualities of a shepherd (guidance, protection, provision, care) are attributed to God.\n        *   **Simile:** It is not a simile because it lacks a comparative particle (e.g., \"The LORD is *like* my shepherd\").\n        *   **Personification:** It is not personification because a shepherd is already a human entity; rather, a divine entity is being compared to a human role.\n        *   **Idiom:** While \"God as shepherd\" is a common biblical image, the phrase itself is not an idiom in the sense of a fixed expression whose meaning is entirely non-literal or culturally specific in a way that obscures its component parts (like \"mouth of the sword\"). The meaning is derived directly from the metaphorical identification.\n        *   **Divine Anthropomorphism:** The prompt states that divine anthropomorphisms (e.g., God went, God was angry) are literal unless they refer to God's body. However, \"The LORD is my shepherd\" is not describing God *doing* a human action or expressing a human emotion, but rather *being* or *identifying* as a human role. The prompt also states that \"Comparisons of role or function, such as 'a prophet like myself' (כָּמֹנִי) or 'a prophet like yourself' (כָּמוֹךָ)\" are literal. Crucially, these examples use the comparative particle \"like.\" In contrast, \"The LORD *is* my shepherd\" is a direct identification (\"X is Y\"), which is the hallmark of a metaphor, not a \"like\" comparison. Therefore, despite being a comparison of role/function, the direct identification makes it a metaphor rather than a literal statement of equivalence.\n    *   **Borderline Cases:** The instruction regarding \"Comparisons of role or function\" was carefully considered. The key distinction is that the prompt's examples for literal comparisons of role/function use \"like\" (כָּמֹנִי, כָּמוֹךָ). The phrase \"יְהֹוָ֥ה רֹ֝עִ֗י\" (The LORD *is* my shepherd) does not use \"like,\" but rather directly equates the LORD with a shepherd. This direct identification is the defining characteristic of a metaphor, making it distinct from the \"literal statements of equivalence or similarity in function\" described in the \"NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE\" section, which explicitly refer to \"like\" comparisons.\n\n3.  **לֹ֣א אֶחְסָֽר (I lack nothing):**\n    *   **Considered:** If this statement of outcome might be hyperbole or another figurative type.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a literal statement of the consequence of the LORD being the speaker's shepherd. It expresses complete provision and satisfaction, but it is a direct, factual claim within the context of the speaker's experience of divine care, not an exaggeration or other figurative device.",

            "detection": "1.  **Phrase/Concept**: כַּצֹּ֤אן (kaṣṣōʾn) / \"Sheeplike\"\n    *   **What I considered**: I considered if this phrase, introduced by the comparative particle כְּ (kə-), constitutes a simile.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion**: This is an explicit comparison of the wicked (the implied subject of \"they head for Sheol\") to sheep. The instruction explicitly states to mark \"obvious similes.\" The comparison highlights their passive, perhaps unwitting, movement towards destruction, similar to sheep being led to slaughter or simply following a path without understanding their ultimate fate.\n    *   **Borderline cases debated**: None; this is a clear and direct simile.\n\n2.  **Phrase/Concept**: לִ֥שְׁא֣וֹל שַׁתּוּ֮ (lišʾōl šattū) / \"they head for Sheol\"\n    *   **What I considered**: I considered if \"Sheol\" or the act of \"heading for Sheol\" might be figurative (e.g., metonymy for death, or Sheol personified).\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion**: In the biblical worldview, Sheol is understood as the literal realm of the dead, the destination for all who die. Therefore, \"heading for Sheol\" is a literal description of the process of dying and entering the afterlife, not a figurative expression. While the *nature* of Sheol is conceptual, the *action* of going there is treated as a literal event in the narrative.\n\n3.  **Phrase/Concept**: מָ֤וֶת יִ֫רְעֵ֥ם (māwet yirʿēm) / \"Death as their shepherd\"\n    *   **What I considered**: I considered if this phrase represents personification, metaphor, or both.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion**: \"Death\" (מָוֶת) is an abstract concept, not a living entity. Attributing the action of \"shepherding\" (יִרְעֵם, from רָעָה, \"to shepherd, feed\") to Death is a clear instance of personification, giving a non-human entity human-like agency and a specific role. Furthermore, it functions as a metaphor, comparing Death's controlling and guiding role over the wicked to that of a shepherd leading his flock. The ground of the comparison is the idea of leading, guiding, and ultimately controlling the destiny of the \"flock.\"\n    *   **Borderline cases debated**: None; this is a clear case of personification and metaphor.\n\n4.  **Phrase/Concept**: וַיִּרְדּ֘וּ־בָ֤ם יְשָׁרִ֨ים&thinsp;׀ לַבֹּ֗קֶר (wayyirddū-vām yəšārîm labōqer) / \"The upright shall rule over them at daybreak\"\n    *   **What I considered**: I considered if \"daybreak\" might be a metaphor for a new era or a sudden change, or if \"rule over them\" might be hyperbolic.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion**: \"Daybreak\" (לַבֹּקֶר) is a specific time of day, often associated with new beginnings or divine intervention in a literal sense (e.g., God acting in the morning). While it carries symbolic weight, the phrase itself describes a literal future event: the upright gaining dominion over the wicked at a specific, albeit prophetically described, time. There is no clear cross-domain comparison or exaggeration beyond what is expected in prophetic language.\n\n5.  **Phrase/Concept**: וְ֭צוּרָם לְבַלּ֥וֹת שְׁא֗וֹל (wəṣûrām ləvallōt šəʾôl) / \"and their form shall waste away in Sheol\"\n    *   **What I considered**: I considered if \"form\" (צוּרָם) or \"waste away\" (לְבַלּוֹת) could be figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion**: \"Form\" refers to the physical body, and \"waste away\" describes the literal process of decay. This is a straightforward description of physical decomposition after death within Sheol.\n\n6.  **Phrase/Concept**: מִזְּבֻ֥ל לֽוֹ (mizzəvul lô) / \"till its nobility be gone.\"\n    *   **What I considered**: I considered if \"nobility\" (זְבֻל) could be a metaphor for something else, or if \"be gone\" was figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion**: Given the textual uncertainty noted in the English translation (\"Meaning of Heb. uncertain\"), and the conservative instruction, interpreting זְבֻל as \"nobility\" or \"exalted dwelling\" leads to a literal description of the loss of status or the decay of Sheol's \"dwelling.\" There is no clear cross-domain comparison or personification. It describes a state of being or a characteristic literally ceasing to exist.",

The term \"shepherd\" (רֹעֵה) is applied to God to describe His role in guiding, protecting, and providing for Israel, much like a human shepherd cares for his flock. This is a clear cross-domain comparison where God (the target) is likened to a shepherd (the vehicle) based on shared qualities of leadership, care, and provision. Therefore, I am including it as a metaphor.\n\n2.  **\"נֹהֵ֣ג כַּצֹּ֣אן יוֹסֵ֑ף\" (who leads Joseph like a flock):**\n    *   **Considered:** If this phrase constitutes a simile.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The presence of the comparative particle \"כַּ\" (like/as) explicitly signals a simile. Joseph (representing the tribes descended from him, particularly the northern kingdom) is directly compared to a \"flock\" (צֹאן) in the context of being led. This comparison highlights the people's dependence and God's guiding role, reinforcing the \"shepherd\" metaphor for God. Therefore, I am including it as a simile.\n\n3.  **\"יֹשֵׁ֖ב הַכְּרוּבִ֣ים\" (You who are enthroned on the cherubim):**\n    *   **Considered:** If this phrase, particularly \"enthroned,\" should be marked as figurative (e.g., anthropomorphism, metaphor).\n    *   **Reasoning:** The instructions state that \"Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God's body (God's finger).\" The phrase \"enthroned on the cherubim\" describes God's position, authority, and mode of divine presence, not a physical body part. In the ANE worldview, God's dwelling or reigning from above/between the cherubim was considered a literal aspect of His divine reality and sovereignty. It is not a cross-domain comparison in the same way \"shepherd\" is, but rather a description of God's perceived literal dwelling place and royal posture. Therefore, I am excluding it as figurative language based on the provided guidelines for divine anthropomorphisms.",
