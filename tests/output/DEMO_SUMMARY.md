## What This Enables

When the **Scholar-Writer agent** receives this research bundle, they will be able to write commentary that:

### 1. Explores Lexical Nuances
- **אור (light)**: Not just physical light, but "light of instruction," "light of face," "Jehovah as Israel's light"
- Asks: What KIND of light is God? Educational? Life-giving? Revelatory?

### 2. Makes Intertextual Connections
- **מעוז (stronghold)** appears in Ps 28:8: "stronghold of salvation of His anointed"
- Ps 27:1 echoes this language - likely part of a thematic cluster
- Pattern: Psalms 25-28 share vocabulary of trust, protection, fear

### 3. Interprets Figurative Language
- **Military fortress → divine protection**: Stronghold metaphor draws on ANE (Ancient Near East) fortress imagery
- **Light vs. darkness**: Not explicitly mentioned, but light metaphor implies deliverance from darkness
- **Parallel structure**: "light/salvation" paired with "stronghold/life" - synonymous parallelism

### 4. Addresses Theological Implications
- **Fear as reverence**: ירא appears both as "terror" and "reverence" - which does the psalmist mean?
- **Salvation (ישע)**: Concrete deliverance or abstract spiritual salvation?
- **Confidence amid threat**: Rhetorical questions ("whom shall I fear?") express confidence
