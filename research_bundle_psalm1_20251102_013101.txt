# Psalm 1 in Jewish Liturgy

Psalm 1 is recited in its entirety within the Yom Kippur evening (Maariv) service, appearing as introductory liturgical material across both Ashkenazic and Edot HaMizrach traditions. In the Edot HaMizrach rite, Psalm 1 is recited as a prefatory supplement before the Aleinu prayer, forming part of a composite devotional block that begins with Psalms 1 through 4 and 24, followed by a Yehi Ratzon supplication, the full Kaddish, and the Aleinu itself. Similarly, among some communities observing the night of Yom Kippur, Psalm 1 functions as an introductory element within a collection of devotional texts known as Shir HaYichud and Anim Zemirot, where it precedes the complete Shir HaYichud recitation for all seven days of the week. The psalm's placement at the opening of these evening devotions on the Day of Atonement reflects its thematic significance as a meditation on the righteous path and divine judgment—concepts particularly resonant with Yom Kippur's penitential focus. The consistent positioning of Psalm 1 as a preparatory text rather than as an independent liturgical unit suggests its role in establishing a contemplative framework for the more elaborate prayers and supplications that follow.

# Scholarly Commentary: Psalm 1:3 in Jewish Liturgy

The opening verses of Psalm 1, particularly the image of the righteous person as "a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither—whatever he does prospers" (Psalm 1:3), appears in Jewish liturgy primarily within the festive season observances of the Sefardic and Mizrahi traditions. The phrase is integrated into the Mussaf Amidah for the Three Pilgrimage Festivals within the Siddur Edot HaMizrach, where it functions as part of the thematic development of blessing and divine favor during these sacred occasions. More significantly, the complete verse is incorporated into the Rosh Hashanah night Kiddush ceremony in the Mizrahi tradition, appearing within an extended acrostic poem ("Shanah Zo...") that precedes the core blessing formulas. In this context, the liturgy states: "אָנָּא יְהֹוָה הוֹשִׁיעָה נָּא, אָנָּא יְהֹוָה הַצְלִיחָה נָא... וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי מָיִם, אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ וְעָלֵהוּ לֹא־יִבּוֹל, וְכֹל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ" ("Please, O Lord, save us; please, O Lord, grant us success... and he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water..."). The deployment of this Psalm verse in the Kiddush ceremony transforms it from a meditation on individual righteousness into a communal petition for blessing and prosperity throughout the new year, linking the personal flourishing described in the Psalm to the collective hopes of the Jewish people at this pivotal moment of spiritual renewal.

# Scholarly Narrative

The phrase "כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם" (like a tree planted by streams of water) from Psalm 1:3 appears in Jewish liturgy exclusively within the Tefillat Geshem (Prayer for Rain), the special piyyutim recited during the Chazzan's repetition of the Mussaf Amidah on Shemini Atzeret across both Ashkenazi and Sefardi traditions. This acrostic poem, which opens with the invocation "אֱלהֵינוּ וֵאלהֵי אֲבותֵינוּ" (Our God and God of our fathers), integrates the Psalmist's botanical imagery into a sophisticated meditation on divine blessing and protection, with the liturgy stating: "בֵּרַכְתּו כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל פַּלְגֵי מַיִם. גְּנַנְתּו הִצַּלְתּוֹ מֵאֵשׁ וּמִמַּיִם" (You blessed him like a tree planted by streams of water; You protected him, saved him from fire and from water). The placement of this phrase within the Gevurot blessing—specifically within the seasonal insertion for winter rain—transforms the Psalmist's metaphor of righteous flourishing into a petition for national sustenance and divine care during the rainy season. The recitation of this piyyut marks the formal commencement of the liturgical year's emphasis on rainfall, making the Psalm's imagery of life-giving waters a central theological motif in the festival's observance. This usage demonstrates how the tradition seamlessly weaves biblical botanical symbolism into the structured framework of the Amidah to align petitionary prayer with seasonal agricultural necessity.

# Scholarly Commentary

The phrase בַּעֲצַת רְשָׁעִים (in the counsel of the wicked), drawn from the opening verse of Psalm 1, appears within the liturgy of the Hakafot (circuits) performed during Simchat Torah in the Sefard tradition, specifically during both the evening and morning services as part of the Torah Service. Within this joyous festival context, the phrase is integrated into a supplicatory passage that reads: וּתְזַכֵּנוּ שֶׁלֹּא נֵלֵךְ בַּעֲצַת רְשָׁעִים, וְלֹא נִהְיֶה מֵהוֹלְכֵי רָכִיל, וּלְמַעַן זְכוּת אַהֲרֹן קְדוֹשׁ יְהֹוָה הֶחָתוּם (merit us that we do not walk in the counsel of the wicked, and are not among those who spread gossip, and for the sake of the merit of Aaron the holy one, O Lord the sealed one). The invocation of Psalm 1's opening admonition serves a protective function during the Hakafot, where the community circles the Torah scrolls in celebration; by explicitly rejecting the counsel of the wicked, the liturgy sanctifies the festive procession and aligns the congregation's joy with righteous conduct. This usage demonstrates how the Sefard rite incorporates biblical wisdom literature into ceremonial moments, transforming Psalm 1's ethical imperative into a blessing that accompanies the most exuberant celebration of Torah in the Jewish calendar.

# Psalm 1:3 in Jewish Liturgy

The verse "וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ וְעָלֵהוּ" (and he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither) appears in the Sefard liturgical tradition during the Hakafot (circuits) of Simchat Torah, recited in both the evening and morning services. Within this festive Torah service, the phrase is integrated into a composite liturgical block that includes introductory verses, piyyutim, and celebratory hymns, appearing specifically within a sequence that emphasizes ethical conduct and divine blessing: "סוּר מֵרָע וַעֲשֵׂה טוֹב, בַּקֵּשׁ שָׁלוֹם וְרָדְפֵהוּ. וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל פַּלְגֵי מַיִם אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ וְעָלֵהוּ לֹא יִבֹּל וְכָל אֲשֶׁר יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ" (Turn from evil and do good, seek peace and pursue it. And he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither, and all that he does shall prosper). This incorporation of Psalm 1:3 during Simchat Torah serves a thematic purpose, connecting the rejoicing over Torah with the promise of spiritual flourishing and righteous conduct that flows from engagement with divine wisdom. The metaphor of the fruitful tree planted by waters resonates particularly during this festival, as it evokes both the water libations associated with Sukkot and the perpetual vitality of those who cleave to Torah.

# Scholarly Commentary: Psalm 1:1 in Jewish Liturgy

The phrase וּבְמוֹשַׁב לֵצִים לֹא from Psalm 1:1 appears in the Jewish liturgical tradition specifically within the framework of Pirkei Avot (the Ethics of the Fathers), as preserved in the Siddur Edot HaMizrach. This citation occurs during the Shabbat afternoon Mincha service, particularly in the supplemental study of Pirkei Avot that is customarily recited between Passover and Shavuot, with one chapter typically studied per week. The Psalmist's words are invoked within a Mishnaic discussion that defines the "seat of scorners" (מוֹשַׁב לֵצִים) as a place where individuals sit together without words of Torah between them. The liturgical context presents the full verse as scriptural support: שֶׁיּוֹשְׁבִין וְאֵין בֵּינֵיהֶם דִּבְרֵי תוֹרָה, הֲרֵי זֶה מוֹשַׁב לֵצִים, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר וּבְמוֹשַׁב לֵצִים לֹא יָשָׁב ("When people sit together and there are no words of Torah between them, this is a seat of scorners, as it is said: 'in the seat of scorners he does not sit'"). This integration of the Psalmist's phrase into the Mishnaic text serves to reinforce the Talmudic principle that the absence of Torah discourse marks a gathering as spiritually deficient, establishing a direct connection between biblical wisdom and rabbinic ethical instruction during the contemplative hours of Shabbat afternoon.

# Scholarly Narrative

The phrase וְֽהָיָ֗ה כְּעֵץ֮ שָׁת֢וּל עַֽל־פַּלְגֵ֫י־מָ֥יִם ("and he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water") from Psalm 1:3 appears in the Siddur Edot HaMizrach as a scriptural proof-text within the study of Pirkei Avot, the Mishnaic tractate of ethical teachings recited on Shabbat afternoons after the Mincha service. This usage occurs particularly during the weeks between Passover and Shavuot, when one chapter of Pirkei Avot is traditionally studied each week as a supplement to the afternoon service. The phrase is cited in the liturgical context of a Talmudic discussion about the righteous person who remains unmoved by worldly disturbances, with the surrounding liturgy stating: "כָּל־הָרוּחוֹת שֶׁבָּעוֹלָם בָּאוֹת וְנוֹשְׁבוֹת בּוֹ, אֵין מְזִיזִין אוֹתוֹ מִמְּקוֹמוֹ, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: וְֽהָיָ֗ה כְּעֵץ֮ שָׁת֢וּל עַֽל־פַּלְגֵ֫י מָ֥יִם, וְעַל יוּבַל יְשַׁלַּח שָֽׁרָשָׁיו" ("All the winds in the world come and blow upon it, yet they do not move it from its place, as it is said: 'and he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water, and by the stream shall he send forth his roots'"). The Psalmist's metaphor of the well-rooted tree thus serves as scriptural validation for the Talmudic principle that the righteous person possesses spiritual stability and resilience. This integration of Psalm 1:3 into the framework of Pirkei Avot exemplifies the rabbinic practice of grounding ethical instruction in biblical proof-texts, making the verse a meaningful component of the Mizrahi liturgical tradition's afternoon study session.
