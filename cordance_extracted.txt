Cardiology

USE CASE 1: Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT) optimization for

heart failure

Clinical Scenario

A 68-year-old patient with HFrEF (EF 32%) presents for follow-up.

They're currently on a beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor but not on an

SGLT2 inhibitor or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA). The

physician is managing a busy clinic with 20+ patients scheduled and

limited time to review complex heart failure guidelines.

Current State Challenges

At a practice level:

Only 5.3% of HFrEF patients achieve complete GDMT within 12 months

    of diagnosis, leaving 94.7% on suboptimal therapy

Difficult to track which patients need medication intensification

    across large patient panels

Real-world data shows patients without full GDMT cost $28,232 per

    person per month vs $14,128 with complete GDMT

At the individual patient level:

Complex 4-pillar therapy requires remembering interactions,

    contraindications, and dosing for multiple drug classes

Prior authorizations for newer agents (SGLT2i, ARNI) create workflow

    delays of 45-60 minutes per patient

Patients face unexpected out-of-pocket costs causing non-adherence

Dose titration schedules are complex and easily forgotten in

    follow-up visits

Cordance Solution

    the physician's panel; creates prioritized list based on greatest

    potential mortality benefit

Pre-loads relevant labs (K+, Cr, BNP) and vitals trends from EHR

Reaches out to patients to capture subjective data (e.g. NYHA class)

    if relevant

During Encounter:

Pre-loads medication history including past intolerance to ACE/ARB

    or reasons for discontinuation

Displays current medication gap analysis with evidence-based

    recommendations and strength of evidence

    triggers front office follow-up re scheduling

Creates patient-friendly education materials on new medications with

    side effect monitoring instructions

Triggers pharmacy outreach for medication reconciliation and

    adherence support

Impact on Three Pillars

Economics (Value-Based Care & Fee-For-Service):

Complete 4-pillar GDMT reduces cardiovascular death or HF

    hospitalization by 62% (HR 0.38) compared to traditional 2-drug

    therapy, translating to 20-30% reduction in 30-day HF readmissions

Real-world data demonstrates $14,104 per person per month cost

    savings with complete GDMT vs no GDMT ($14,128 vs $28,232)

Captures quality bonuses in value-based contracts (HEDIS Heart

    Failure measures, MIPS stars rating)

Eliminates time-consuming manual prior authorization work (saves

    45-60 min per PA)

Reduces revenue leakage from incomplete billing for HF management

    codes

Estimated financial impact: $200K-$300K annually per cardiologist

    through reduced readmissions and quality bonuses; four-drug regimen

    adds 6+ years of life compared to traditional approach

Quality & Safety:

ARNIs reduce all-cause mortality by 41% (HR 0.59); SGLT2i reduce HF

    hospitalization by 84% when combined with 2-drug GDMT

Reduces HF mortality by 30-40% through evidence-based GDMT; prevents

    one death for every four patients treated over 2 years with

    quadruple therapy

Decreases adverse drug events through automated interaction

    screening and renal dosing

Ensures appropriate monitoring labs are ordered with new medications

    (K+, Cr within 1-2 weeks of initiation)

Reduces medication errors from inappropriate dosing in renal

    insufficiency

Lowers malpractice risk through documented adherence to 2024 ACC

    guidelines

Population Health & Outcomes:

Systematic identification of undertreated HF patients across entire

    practice enables population-level GDMT optimization

Reduces disparities by ensuring all eligible patients offered

    optimal therapy regardless of insurance or socioeconomic status

Improves medication adherence through cost transparency and patient

    education

Enables proactive population management with panel-level gap

    analysis showing real-time GDMT adoption rates

Estimated impact: 25-35% improvement in GDMT adherence rates across

    HFrEF population (from current 5.3% to 30-40% achieving full

    4-pillar therapy)

USE CASE 6: Ambulatory Procedural Site Optimization (Cath Lab vs ASC)

Clinical Scenario

A 65-year-old patient needs an elective diagnostic cardiac catheterization for stable angina. The health system has both a hospital-based cath lab and an ambulatory surgery center (ASC) with similar capabilities. The physician must decide which facility offers the best combination of safety, cost-effectiveness, and patient convenience.

Current State Challenges

At a practice level:

Procedural volume fragmentation across multiple facilities reduces efficiency and increases costs

Lack of real-time visibility into ASC vs hospital margin differences for specific procedures

Manual assessment of patient appropriateness for ASC leads to suboptimal utilization

At the individual patient level:

Physicians default to hospital-based procedures due to familiarity, missing ASC cost savings opportunities

Complex criteria for ASC safety (BMI, comorbidities, anesthesia risk) require time-consuming assessment

Patients unaware of ASC advantages: lower copays, convenient parking, faster discharge

Scheduling challenges across multiple sites lead to delays in care

USE CASE 8: Chest Pain Triage with Coronary CTA vs Nuclear Stress

Clinical Scenario

A 48-year-old patient with atypical chest pain and intermediate pretest probability of CAD presents to cardiology clinic. The physician considers stress testing but is uncertain whether coronary CTA, nuclear stress test, or stress echo offers the best diagnostic pathway balancing accuracy, cost, and radiation exposure.

Current State Challenges

At a practice level:

Nuclear stress testing remains default strategy despite coronary CTA advantages for low-intermediate risk patients

Radiation exposure from nuclear imaging (10-15 mSv) often exceeds CTA (2-5 mSv with modern protocols)

CTA capacity bottlenecks lead to delays, defaulting to nuclear stress despite being suboptimal

At the individual patient level:

Physicians unfamiliar with patient selection criteria for CTA (age, heart rate, BMI, renal function)

Insurance variability in CTA coverage creates uncertainty about authorization

Patients face different costs: nuclear stress $2,500-$4,000 vs CTA $1,000-$2,000

Test selection impacts downstream care: CTA negative predictive value 99% allows confident exclusion of CAD

Cordance Solution

Before Encounter

Identifies all patients with chest pain or suspected CAD scheduled for evaluation

Schedules CTA at optimal time with pre-procedure beta-blocker prescription if needed

Sends patient prep instructions: 4-hour fast, avoid caffeine, bring heart rate medications

Triggers automated result follow-up workflow: if CTA negative → reassurance + risk factor management; if CTA positive → cardiology consult + stress test vs cath decision

Impact on Three Pillars

Economics (Value-Based Care & Fee-for-Service)

CTA costs 40-60% less than nuclear stress testing ($1,200 vs $3,000 per test)[21]

Higher diagnostic accuracy reduces unnecessary downstream catheterizations by 30%

Preferred by payers due to cost-effectiveness, reducing authorization challenges

Estimated financial impact: $80K-$150K annually per cardiologist through optimized test selection and reduced unnecessary procedures

Quality & Safety

CTA negative predictive value 99% allows confident CAD exclusion, vs 85% for nuclear stress[22]
