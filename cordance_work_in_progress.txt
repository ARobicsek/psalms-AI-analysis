USE CASE 1: Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT) optimization for

heart failure

Clinical Scenario

A 68-year-old patient with HFrEF (EF 32%) presents for follow-up.

They're currently on a beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor but not on an

SGLT2 inhibitor or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA). The

physician is managing a busy clinic with 20+ patients scheduled and

limited time to review complex heart failure guidelines.

Current State Challenges

At a practice level:

Only 5.3% of HFrEF patients achieve complete GDMT within 12 months

    of diagnosis, leaving 94.7% on suboptimal therapy

Difficult to track which patients need medication intensification

    across large patient panels

Real-world data shows patients without full GDMT cost $28,232 per

    person per month vs $14,128 with complete GDMT

At the individual patient level:

Complex 4-pillar therapy requires remembering interactions,

    contraindications, and dosing for multiple drug classes

Prior authorizations for newer agents (SGLT2i, ARNI) create workflow

    delays of 45-60 minutes per patient

Patients face unexpected out-of-pocket costs causing non-adherence

Dose titration schedules are complex and easily forgotten in

    follow-up visits

    adherence support

Impact on Three Pillars

Economics (Value-Based Care & Fee-For-Service):

Complete 4-pillar GDMT reduces cardiovascular death or HF

    hospitalization by 62% (HR 0.38) compared to traditional 2-drug

    therapy, translating to 20-30% reduction in 30-day HF readmissions

Real-world data demonstrates $14,104 per person per month cost

    savings with complete GDMT vs no GDMT ($14,128 vs $28,232)

Captures quality bonuses in value-based contracts (HEDIS Heart

    Failure measures, MIPS stars rating)

Eliminates time-consuming manual prior authorization work (saves

    45-60 min per PA)

Reduces revenue leakage from incomplete billing for HF management

    codes

Estimated financial impact: $200K-$300K annually per cardiologist

    through reduced readmissions and quality bonuses; four-drug regimen

    adds 6+ years of life compared to traditional approach

Quality & Safety:

ARNIs reduce all-cause mortality by 41% (HR 0.59); SGLT2i reduce HF

    hospitalization by 84% when combined with 2-drug GDMT

Reduces HF mortality by 30-40% through evidence-based GDMT; prevents

    one death for every four patients treated over 2 years with

    quadruple therapy

Decreases adverse drug events through automated interaction

    screening and renal dosing

Ensures appropriate monitoring labs are ordered with new medications

    (K+, Cr within 1-2 weeks of initiation)

Reduces medication errors from inappropriate dosing in renal

    insufficiency

Lowers malpractice risk through documented adherence to 2024 ACC

    guidelines

Population Health & Outcomes:

Systematic identification of undertreated HF patients across entire

    practice enables population-level GDMT optimization

Reduces disparities by ensuring all eligible patients offered

    optimal therapy regardless of insurance or socioeconomic status

Improves medication adherence through cost transparency and patient

    education

Enables proactive population management with panel-level gap

    analysis showing real-time GDMT adoption rates
