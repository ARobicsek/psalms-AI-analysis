# Verse-by-verse Commentary on Psalm 20

## Verse 1
**לַמְנַצֵּחַ מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד**  
*To the choirmaster. A psalm of David.*

The superscription's elegant simplicity—merely "psalm of David" without additional liturgical markers—contrasts sharply with the complex ritual dialogue that unfolds. The term לַמְנַצֵּחַ (*lamnatseach*), traditionally "to the choirmaster," derives from a root meaning "to be pre-eminent" or "enduring." According to BDB, this title appears in 55 psalms taken from what scholars call the "Director's Collection," a major Psalter from the Greek period that served as the synagogue's prayer book. The absence of additional markers like "with stringed instruments" or "according to Mahalath" found in other royal psalms suggests this composition functioned as a standard liturgical piece rather than a specialized ceremonial text.

The attribution "of David" (לְדָוִד) employs the preposition ל, which can indicate authorship, dedication, or association with Davidic tradition. In the context of royal psalms, this likely signals the piece's connection to the institution of Davidic kingship rather than personal authorship. The term מִזְמוֹר (*mizmor*) specifically denotes a psalm meant for instrumental accompaniment, distinguishing it from שִׁיר (*shir*, song) or תְּהִלָּה (*tehillah*, praise). This musical designation prepares us for the psalm's performative character—not merely a written prayer but a dramatic liturgical event requiring multiple voices, instrumental backing, and choreographed ritual movements that will unfold in the verses ahead.

## Verse 2
**יַֽעַנְךָ֣ יְ֭הֹוָה בְּי֣וֹם צָרָ֑ה יְ֝שַׂגֶּבְךָ֗ שֵׁ֤ם ׀ אֱלֹהֵ֬י יַעֲקֹֽב**  
*May the LORD answer you in time of trouble, the name of Jacob's God keep you safe.*

The psalm opens with a rapid succession of jussive verbs creating what might be called the "liturgical machinery of intercession." The verb יַעֲנְךָ (*ya'ankhá*, "may he answer you") appears 110 times in the Qal form across Scripture, most frequently in contexts of divine response to human distress. The concordance reveals this as God's characteristic action in crisis: He answered Moses at the burning bush (Exodus 3:14), Hannah in her barrenness (1 Samuel 1:17), and the people in wilderness rebellions (Numbers 11:2).

The phrase בְּיוֹם צָרָה (*beyom tsarah*, "in day of trouble") employs the construct form where "day" (יוֹם) becomes temporally specific rather than merely chronological. BDB shows יוֹם frequently functioning as "time of" crisis, battle, or divine intervention—this is the pregnant moment when human resources fail and divine aid becomes essential. The parallelism moves from temporal specificity ("day of trouble") to spatial protection ("keep you safe"), creating both horizontal and vertical dimensions of security.

The progression from "the LORD" (יְהֹוָה) to "the name of Jacob's God" (שֵׁם אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב) is theologically significant. Jacob's name appears in only twelve psalmic contexts, all emphasizing covenant relationship and divine fidelity despite human weakness. The "name" (שֵׁם) functions here as more than designation—it represents God's revealed character and accessible presence. Traditional commentators note this distance: "Jacob's God" rather than "your God" suggests priestly intercession on behalf of the king, creating liturgical objectivity in this opening petition.

## Verse 3
**יִשְׁלַֽח־עֶזְרְךָ֥ מִקֹּ֑דֶשׁ וּ֝מִצִּיּ֗וֹן יִסְעָדֶֽךָּ**  
*May He send you help from the sanctuary, and sustain you from Zion.*

This verse establishes the psalm's crucial spatial theology through synonymous parallelism that proves more complex than initially apparent. The sanctuary (מִקֹּדֶשׁ) and Zion (מִצִּיּוֹן) create both horizontal equivalence and vertical tension. BDB reveals קֹדֶשׁ's semantic range encompasses both earthly sanctuary and heavenly dwelling—precisely the ambiguity that will be resolved dramatically in verse 7.

The verb יִשְׁלַח (*yishlach*, "may he send") governs both supernatural aid and concrete sustenance, appearing 847 times in Scripture with meanings ranging from literal sending to divine commissioning. The parallelism between "help" (עֶזְרְךָ) and "sustain" (יִסְעָדֶךָּ) moves from general assistance to specific support. The root סעד (*sa'ad*) appears only 12 times in Scripture, always indicating divine upholding in moments of potential collapse (cf. Psalm 18:35, "Your right hand sustained me").

Archaeological evidence suggests pre-battle rituals occurred both in the Jerusalem temple and at high places like Gibeon, where the "great high place" served monarchic religious functions. The dual location reference may indicate the complexity of royal religious practice—formal temple ritual complemented by traditional sacred sites. The prepositions מִן (*min*, "from") create a sense of divine resources flowing outward from sacred centers toward the battlefield, establishing the theological geography that frames the entire psalm.

The Septuagint renders both terms with ἐκ + ἁγίων ("from holy places"), suggesting the ancient Greek translators already recognized the spatial equivalence while preserving the Hebrew's theological richness.

## Verse 4
**יִזְכֹּ֥ר כׇּל־מִנְחֹתֶ֑יךָ וְעוֹלָתְךָ֖ יְדַשְּׁנֶ֣ה סֶֽלָה**  
*May He be mindful of all your meal offerings; may your burnt offering be acceptable. Selah*

This verse presents the psalm's most lexically challenging moment through technical sacrificial terminology that has puzzled interpreters for centuries. The verb יִזְכֹּר (*yizkor*, "may he remember") employs divine remembrance as active intervention rather than mental recollection. BDB's concordance reveals זכר in cultic contexts consistently means "to act favorably on the basis of previous relationship"—God remembers Noah (Genesis 8:1), Hannah's barrenness (1 Samuel 1:19), and Israel's covenant (Leviticus 26:42).

The term מִנְחֹתֶיךָ (*minchoteikha*, "your meal offerings") employs the plural form, suggesting sustained ritual practice rather than single ceremonial acts. Traditional commentators understand these as the prayers offered during military campaigns. Rashi explains: "They are the prayers that you pray in battle," connecting abstract petition with concrete sacrificial language.

The crux interpretum lies in יְדַשְּׁנֶה (*yedasheneh*), a hapax legomenon (appearing only here) whose meaning has generated extensive debate. The root דשן (*dashen*) typically means "to be fat" or "to prosper," leading to interpretations ranging from "accept favorably" to "turn to ashes" to "make fat/rich." Rashi opts for acceptance: "He will accept them willingly like fat burnt offerings." Ibn Ezra suggests the altar fire will consume the offering completely, "and it will become fat [with ashes]." Radak combines both: "He will send fire to burn it and receive it favorably."

The rare grammatical form (qal imperfect with archaic ending) suggests either textual corruption or deliberately archaic liturgical language. The Septuagint's πιανθείη (*piantheiē*, "may it be made fat/rich") supports the positive interpretation. The selah marking indicates a musical or liturgical pause, perhaps accompanying the actual offering of sacrifices during the ritual performance.

## Verse 5
**יִֽתֶּן־לְךָ֥ כִלְבָבֶ֑ךָ וְֽכׇל־עֲצָתְךָ֥ יְמַלֵּֽא**  
*May He grant you your heart's desire, and fulfill your every plan.*

The verse crescendos the priestly intercession through comprehensive blessing that moves from internal desire to external accomplishment. The phrase כִלְבָבֶךָ (*khilvavekha*, "according to your heart") employs the fuller form לֵבָב (*levav*) rather than the more common לֵב (*lev*), creating both metrical weight and semantic intensity. BDB reveals לֵבָב appears 251 times, often in contexts requiring emphasis on the complete inner person—mind, will, and emotion united.

The progression from "heart's desire" to "every plan" (כׇל־עֲצָתְךָ) creates synthetic parallelism that expands rather than merely repeats. The term עֵצָה (*etsah*) appears 87 times in Scripture, ranging from human counsel to divine purpose. In royal contexts, it frequently denotes strategic planning for warfare (cf. 2 Samuel 16:23, where Ahithophel's counsel was "as if one inquired of the word of God").

The verb יְמַלֵּא (*yemalle*, "may he fulfill") employs the piel intensive form, suggesting complete, thorough accomplishment rather than partial satisfaction. The concordance shows מלא in divine contexts consistently indicates total fulfillment—God fills the earth with his glory (Numbers 14:21), fills the temple with his presence (1 Kings 8:11), and fulfills his promises completely.

Traditional Jewish interpretation sees this verse as the culmination of ritual preparation leading to military action. The sequence moves logically from sacrificial offerings (verse 4) through divine acceptance to comprehensive blessing that encompasses both private aspiration and public responsibility. The heart's desire and strategic planning must align—successful kingship requires both personal righteousness and practical wisdom, both divine favor and human competence.

## Verse 6
**נְרַנְּנָ֤ה ׀ בִּ֘ישׁ֤וּעָתֶ֗ךָ וּבְשֵׁ֣ם אֱ֭לֹהֵינוּ נִדְגֹּ֑ל יְמַלֵּ֥א יְ֝הֹוָ֗ה כׇּל־מִשְׁאֲלוֹתֶֽיךָ**  
*We will shout for joy at your victory, and raise our banners in the name of our God. May the LORD fulfill all your requests.*

This verse marks a dramatic liturgical shift from second-person intercession ("may He grant you") to first-person plural participation ("we will shout"). The community now joins the king's anticipated triumph, moving from petition to confident celebration. The verb נְרַנְּנָה (*nerannena*, "we will shout for joy") employs the piel intensive form of רנן, which appears 54 times in Scripture, predominantly in contexts of cultic celebration and victory songs.

The phrase בִּישׁוּעָתֶךָ (*bishuat'kha*, "at your victory") creates interpretive ambiguity: does this refer to the king's victory or God's salvation through the king? The suffix could modify either subject, and traditional commentators prefer the latter—the king's success manifests divine deliverance. The term יְשׁוּעָה (*yeshuah*) appears 78 times, almost always indicating God's salvific intervention rather than human achievement.

The curious verb נִדְגֹּל (*nidgol*, "we will raise banners") presents textual difficulties. This root appears only here and in the Song of Songs (6:4, 10), making interpretation challenging. BDB suggests "to look upon" or "to be conspicuous like a banner." The Septuagint renders it μεγαλυνθησόμεθα ("we shall be magnified"), perhaps reading a different Hebrew text. Modern scholars propose various emendations, but the military context supports "raise banners/standards" as victory celebration.

The theological progression from "the name of Jacob's God" (verse 2) to "the name of our God" (verse 6) indicates growing intimacy and identification. The community now claims divine relationship directly rather than through patriarchal mediation. This suggests the ritual's function in creating or reinforcing covenant bond between people, king, and deity.

The verse concludes by returning to petition (יְמַלֵּא יְהֹוָה, "may the LORD fulfill"), creating envelope structure around the celebratory center and maintaining liturgical balance between confidence and humility.

## Verse 7
**עַתָּ֤ה יָדַ֗עְתִּי כִּ֤י הוֹשִׁ֥יעַ ׀ יְהֹוָ֗ה מְשִׁ֫יח֥וֹ יַ֭עֲנֵהוּ מִשְּׁמֵ֣י קׇדְשׁ֑וֹ בִּ֝גְבֻר֗וֹת יֵ֣שַׁע יְמִינֽוֹ**  
*Now I know that the LORD will give victory to His anointed, will answer him from His heavenly sanctuary with the mighty victories of His right arm.*

This verse constitutes the psalm's dramatic turning point through sudden prophetic intervention that transforms petition into proclamation. The formula עַתָּה יָדַעְתִּי (*attah yadati*, "now I know") appears only four times in Hebrew Scripture (Genesis 22:12, Exodus 18:11, Judges 17:13, and here), each marking moments of divine revelation or recognition. The parallel passages suggest this is not gradual realization but instantaneous, oracular certainty.

Who speaks this line remains debated. Traditional commentators divide between seeing this as congregational response or prophetic oracle. Ibn Ezra suggests "the singer in the holy spirit," while Radak sees "every individual Israelite" speaking. The abrupt certainty argues for prophetic intervention—perhaps a temple prophet receiving divine assurance mid-ritual, transforming the liturgical atmosphere from petition to proclamation.

The term מְשִׁיחוֹ (*meshicho*, "his anointed") elevates the specific monarch to archetypal status. The concordance reveals מָשִׁיחַ (*mashiach*) appearing 39 times in Scripture, most frequently referring to Israel's king as divinely chosen and protected. Here the possessive suffix emphasizes divine ownership—this is not merely Israel's king but the LORD's anointed, creating theological grounds for confident intervention.

The spatial theology undergoes crucial transformation: help that was to come "from the sanctuary" (מִקֹּדֶשׁ, verse 3) now comes "from his heavenly sanctuary" (מִשְּׁמֵי קׇדְשׁוֹ). This movement from earthly to celestial sanctuary suggests God operates simultaneously on both planes—present in the temple but not confined to it. The phrase בִּגְבֻרוֹת יֵשַׁע יְמִינוֹ (*bigevurot yesha yemino*, "with the mighty victories of his right hand") employs military metaphor for divine action, with יָמִין (*yamin*) appearing 139 times as God's instrument of deliverance.

## Verse 8
**אֵ֣לֶּה בָ֭רֶכֶב וְאֵ֣לֶּה בַסּוּסִ֑ים וַאֲנַ֓חְנוּ ׀ בְּשֵׁ֖ם יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵ֗ינוּ נַזְכִּֽיר**  
*Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we invoke the name of the LORD our God.*

This verse presents one of Scripture's most pointed antitheses through elegant Hebrew construction that creates stark rhetorical contrast. The structure אֵלֶּה...וְאֵלֶּה (*elleh...v'elleh*, "these...and these") versus וַאֲנַחְנוּ (*va'anachnu*, "but we") establishes binary opposition between "they" and "we," creating what scholars term "theological polemic" against reliance on military technology.

The historical context proves crucial: archaeological evidence and ancient Near Eastern records confirm that chariotry and cavalry represented cutting-edge military innovation. Egypt built its empire on 4,000-chariot divisions, while Assyria deployed cavalry units that revolutionized warfare. The Lachish reliefs show Sennacherib's siege engines and mounted archers that made Assyrian armies seemingly invincible. Israel's poet acknowledges this technological disparity but reframes it as theological advantage.

The verb נַזְכִּיר (*nazkir*, "we invoke/remember") deserves careful analysis. BDB reveals this hiphil form appearing 169 times with meanings ranging from "mention" to "remember" to "make memorial offering." Rashi connects it to sacrificial language: "an expression of burning sacrifices and prayer, like 'he who burns frankincense' and 'its memorial portion.'" The verb creates deliberate wordplay with the אַזְכָּרָה (*azkarah*, "memorial portion") of grain offerings mentioned in verse 4, linking liturgical remembrance to divine intervention.

The divine name progression reaches crescendo: "name of Jacob's God" (verse 2) becomes "name of our God" (verse 6) and now "name of the LORD our God" (verse 8). This movement from patriarchal distance through communal identification to covenantal intimacy traces the ritual's transformative effect. The tetragrammaton יְהֹוָה appears here for the first time since verse 7, emphasizing the personal covenant name over generic divine titles.

Traditional Jewish interpretation sees this as Israel's fundamental theological confession: military technology represents human confidence, while divine name-invocation represents covenant relationship that transcends material limitations.

## Verse 9
**הֵ֣מָּה כָּרְע֣וּ וְנָפָ֑לוּ וַאֲנַ֖חְנוּ קַּ֣מְנוּ וַנִּתְעוֹדָֽד**  
*They collapse and fall, but we rise and stand firm.*

The prophetic voice continues with perfect verbs that describe future victory as accomplished fact—a characteristic feature of Hebrew prophetic literature called the "prophetic perfect." The verbs כָּרְעוּ (*kar'u*, "they bowed down") and נָפָלוּ (*nafalu*, "they fell") create a downward trajectory contrasted sharply with קַמְנוּ (*kamnu*, "we arose") and וַנִּתְעוֹדָד (*vanitodad*, "we stood firm").

The root כרע (*kara'*) appears 36 times in Scripture, primarily in contexts of worship (bowing before God) or defeat (collapsing in battle). The dual semantic range creates ironic wordplay: those who should bow only before God instead collapse in military defeat. The parallel נפל (*nafal*) governs 434 biblical occurrences, frequently describing military casualties and divine judgment upon the wicked.

The contrasting verbs employ different semantic fields: קום (*qum*, "to rise") appears 627 times with meanings ranging from physical standing to social advancement to resurrection. The unusual form וַנִּתְעוֹדָד (*vanitodad*, "we stood firm") presents textual difficulties. This root עוד (*ud*) appears only here and in two other passages (Psalms 146:9; 147:6), possibly meaning "restore" or "support." The hitpoel reflexive form suggests self-restoration or divine strengthening.

The physical posture metaphor—falling versus standing—represents military outcome but carries broader theological implications. BDB reveals Hebrew idioms consistently employ "standing" for survival, vindication, and divine approval (cf. Psalm 1:5, "the wicked will not stand in judgment"). The progression from collapse through restoration to firm standing describes not merely military victory but comprehensive divine reversal of human power structures.

The Septuagint renders the final verb ἀνωρθώθημεν ("we were set upright"), emphasizing divine rather than human agency in restoration. This interpretive choice aligns with the psalm's consistent emphasis on divine action as the decisive factor in royal success.

## Verse 10
**יְהֹוָ֥ה הוֹשִׁ֑יעָה הַ֝מֶּ֗לֶךְ יַעֲנֵ֥נוּ בְיוֹם־קׇרְאֵֽנוּ**  
*LORD, save! May the King answer us in the day we call.*

The psalm's conclusion presents one of Hebrew Scripture's most intriguing syntactic ambiguities that has generated extensive interpretive debate. The crux lies in הַמֶּלֶךְ (*hammelekh*, "the King"): does this function as subject ("may the King answer us") or as vocative ("O King, answer us")? The traditional accentuation treats it as subject, but grammatical arguments exist for both readings.

The interpretive choice proves theologically significant because it determines whether "the King" refers to God or the human monarch. Traditional commentators largely resolve this in favor of divine kingship. Radak explains: "the King: God, who is the King of the world, and in his hand is our salvation." Ibn Ezra concurs: "the King is the Name [God], who is truly the King, for David is his anointed." This interpretive tradition collapses the distinction between divine and human authority at the moment of final appeal.

The verb הוֹשִׁיעָה (*hoshi'ah*, "save!") employs the hiphil imperative form, appearing 184 times in Scripture as the standard cry for divine deliverance. The root ישע (*yasha'*) governs the entire semantic field of salvation, from physical rescue to spiritual redemption. The imperative mood creates liturgical urgency—this is not theological speculation but ritual crisis requiring immediate divine response.

The temporal phrase בְיוֹם־קׇרְאֵֽנוּ (*beyom kore'enu*, "in the day we call") creates inclusio with בְּיוֹם צָרָה (*beyom tsarah*, "in day of trouble") from verse 2. This envelope structure brackets the entire psalm within the temporal framework of crisis and divine response, emphasizing the liturgy's function as bridge between human need and divine aid.

The syntactic ambiguity may serve the psalm's theological purpose rather than creating interpretive confusion. By leaving "the King" grammatically ambiguous, the text preserves the mystery of divine-human relationship in monarchy: human kings succeed only insofar as they remain transparent to divine kingship. The final verse thus encapsulates the psalm's central insight—legitimate royal power derives from divine authorization rather than human achievement, making every earthly king dependent upon the ultimate King for both authority and deliverance.
