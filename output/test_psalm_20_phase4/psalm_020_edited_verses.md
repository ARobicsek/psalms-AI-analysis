**Verse 1**
“To the choirmaster. A psalm of David.” The superscription is characteristically spare. “To the choirmaster” (לַמְנַצֵּחַ) likely assigns the piece to the guild responsible for performance; proposals that all such psalms derive from a “Director’s Collection” are suggestive but remain hypotheses. The Davidic tag (לְדָוִד) can mark authorship, patronage, or tradition; here it situates the prayer in the royal cult. The economy of the title belies the complex staging that follows: a service with shifting speakers, suited to a pre‑battle rite.

**Verse 2**
“May the LORD answer you in the day of trouble; may the name of the God of Jacob set you on high.” The verse pairs answer and elevation. The second verb (יְשַׂגֶּבְךָ) means “set securely on high,” the idiom of refuge. “The day of trouble” frames the psalm (cf. v. 10 “the day we call”), a tight inclusio. The epithet “God of Jacob” is a psalmic favorite (e.g., 46:8): ancestral and covenantal, it invokes a God known for rescuing strugglers. Already we have the theme of the “name” (שֵׁם)—not a mere label, but God’s presence and character made available; to be “set on high” by the name is to be secured by that relationship.

**Verse 3**
“May he send you help from the sanctuary, and support you from Zion.” The parallel lines identify source and echo. “Sanctuary” (מִקֹּדֶשׁ) and “Zion” answer to each other; the help that comes is both earthly (from the temple mount) and, by implication, heavenly (cf. v. 7). The second verb (יִסְעָדֶךָ) is chosen for weight: “support, sustain,” often used for what prevents a collapse (cf. Ps 18:36). The preposition “from” in both cola draws an arc from the holy place to the battlefield. Compare Psalm 3:4–5: the cry goes up, the answer comes “from his holy mountain.”

**Verse 4**
“May he remember all your grain‑offerings; your burnt offering—may he make it fat. Selah.” “Remember” (זכר) in cultic contexts means “act favorably on the basis of relationship.” The grain‑offering and burnt offering are the standard gifts of petition. The crux is יְדַשְּׁנֶה, from דשׁן (“rich, fat”). Traditional readings converge: accept with favor, as with a fat offering; or, send fire to consume, turning it to ashes—the sign of acceptance. The LXX’s πιαίνειν (“make rich/fat”) supports the positive nuance. Selah plausibly marks a liturgical pause—just where the ritual action would occur. The theology is precise: acceptance at the altar prefaces the king’s strategy (v. 5).

**Verse 5**
“May he grant you in accord with your heart, and fulfill all your plans.” “Heart” (לֵבָב) is the biblical inner person—mind, will, desire. The prayer moves from cult to conduct: from offerings (v. 4) to intentions and counsel (עֵצָה can be “strategy”). God’s fulfillment (יְמַלֵּא) is emphatic; when applied to God it implies completeness rather than partial success. The verse is not a blank check; within the psalm’s logic, the king’s plans are to be aligned through sacrifice and prayer (vv. 3–4). Deuteronomy’s war liturgy (Deut 20) belongs in the background: before battle the priest addresses the army; confidence is derivative, not innate.

**Verse 6**
“We will shout for joy in your victory, and in the name of our God we will raise the banner; may the LORD fulfill all your requests.” The communal “we” breaks in. The middle line hinges on a rare verb (נִדְגֹּל), from a root associated with banners/standards (cf. Song 6:4, 10). Most take it, sensibly in context, as “raise the standard” or “be conspicuous like a banner.” The Greek renders “we shall be magnified,” which may reflect a different Hebrew (“we will make great the name”), but the Masoretic text’s military image suits the scene. Note the movement in the name motif: from “the God of Jacob” (v. 2) to “our God” (v. 6). The stanza returns to petition (“may the LORD fulfill…”), balancing celebration with dependence.

**Verse 7**
“Now I know that the LORD saves his anointed; he answers him from his holy heavens, with mighty deeds of the victory of his right hand.” The liturgy pivots on “Now I know” (עַתָּה יָדַעְתִּי), the formula of decisive recognition (Gen 22:12; Exod 18:11). Whether we hear the congregation, a leader, or a temple prophet, the service receives assurance. The spatial axis widens: help formerly “from the sanctuary” (v. 3) is now “from his holy heavens.” The king is named “his anointed” (מְשִׁיחוֹ), not for messianic speculation here, but to mark royal office as derivative. The “right hand” is a standard metaphor for God’s effective power; the plural “mighty deeds” (גְבֻרוֹת) underscores repeated interventions, not a single stroke.

**Verse 8**
“These in chariots and those in horses, but we—by the name of the LORD our God we will invoke/remember.” The line is all clenched antithesis: אֵלֶּה… וְאֵלֶּה… וַאֲנַחְנוּ. The verb נַזְכִּיר (“cause to remember/mention”) is cultic and fits the psalm’s sacrificial texture (cf. the grain‑offering’s אַזְכָּרָה). Some prefer the Greek’s “we shall be magnified,” which would imply a different Hebrew, but the Masoretic sense is bracing: our “weapon” is invocation. Deuteronomy stands behind this defiance: the king must not “multiply horses” (Deut 17:16), and Israel is warned against trusting Egyptian cavalry (Isa 31:1). Psalm 33:16–17 sharpens the point: “A horse is a vain hope for victory.” Here theology answers technology.

**Verse 9**
“They—they have knelt and fallen; but we have arisen and been set upright.” The syntax juxtaposes completed defeat with completed restoration. The rare final verb (וַנִּתְעוֹדָד), a reflexive of a root meaning “restore/relieve,” likely means “we were set upright” (LXX ἀνωρθώθημεν). The physical metaphors for posture (falling/standing) carry legal and existential freight in biblical idiom (cf. Ps 1:5: the wicked will not “stand” in judgment). The line is not triumphalist so much as capacious: it promises not only surviving the battle but regaining one’s bearings.

**Verse 10**
“O LORD, save! May the King answer us in the day we call.” The closing acclamation gathers the psalm’s strands. “O LORD, save!” (יְהוָה הוֹשִׁיעָה) is the oldest cry of Israel’s worship (compare Ps 118:25). The next clause is syntactically ambiguous: is “the King” the human monarch or the divine King? Accents favor reading “the King” as subject, not direct address; traditional Jewish exegesis takes “the King” as God (Radak: “the King of the world”). The ambiguity is artful. In a psalm where the human king is consistently “his anointed,” it is fitting to end with the King whose answer makes every other cry meaningful. The inclusio closes: we have moved from “the day of trouble” (v. 2) to “the day we call,” and in between the community has learned how to name help.

Poetics and framing deserve one last word. The psalm’s first half (vv. 2–5) is built on anaphoric jussives that gather the congregation’s hopes into a cadence; the center (v. 7) supplies the oracle; the antithesis (v. 8) states the program; the posture (v. 9) supplies the image; the final acclamation (v. 10) returns us to prayer. Read with Psalm 21, the whole becomes a ritual diptych of asking and thanksgiving. Read on its own, Psalm 20 instructs the royal imagination: trust the name; keep the offerings; look beyond the chariots; and call on the King.
