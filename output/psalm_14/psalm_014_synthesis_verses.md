### **Verse 1**

**לַמְנַצֵּחַח לְדָוִד; אָמַר נָבָל בְּלִבּוֹ, אֵין אֱלֹהִים; הִשְׁחִיתוּ הִתְעִיבוּ עֲלִילָה, אֵין עֹשֶה-טוֹב׃**

The psalm opens not with a lament but with a diagnosis, a stark philosophical statement attributed to the *nābāl*. This term, as the BDB lexicon clarifies, is not a lack of intelligence but a profound moral and religious insensibility. The fool’s declaration, “*’ēyn ’elōhîm*” (“there is no God”), is not modern atheism but a claim of practical godlessness, a moral decision to live as if God’s active governance does not exist. This finds a direct parallel in the concise language of Psalm 10:4: `רָשָׁע כְּגֹ֑בָה אַפּוֹ לֹא יִדְרֹשׁ אֵין אֱלֹהִים כׇּל־מְזִמּוֹתָיוֹ`. The psalmist then universalizes this condition, moving from the singular “fool” to the collective “they” (*hishḥîtū*, *hit’îvū*). The verbs are visceral, painting a picture of active decay and ritual defilement. This is not passive sin but an aggressive turning away from the divine path.

The verdict concludes with the crushing repetition, “*’ēin ‘ōseh ��v*” (“no one does good”), which forms an inclusio with the opening line, creating a feeling of being trapped. This absolute statement, echoing Deuteronomy 32:18’s description of a faithless generation, serves as the psalm’s foundational indictment against the human condition, a dark backdrop against which the hope of Zion will later shine. The abrupt shift from the fool’s internal thought to a universal third-person accusation is jarring and structurally brilliant, mirroring the suddenness with which corruption can permeate a society.

### **Verse 2**

**יְהוָה, מִשָּמַיִם הִשְקִיף עַל-בְנֵי-אָדָם; לִרְאוֹת, הֲיֵשׁ מַשְׂכִּיל דֹֹרֵשׁ אֶת-אֱלֹהִים׃**

The perspective shifts dramatically here from the human heart to the divine, creating a cinematic zoom-out. God is not immediately angry; He is an investigator, a diagnostician (*hišqîp*) peering down from a cosmic height. The verb *hišqif* is used elsewhere for God’s omniscient gaze (e.g., Gen. 18:21: `וַיִשְׁקִיף ה' מִשָּמַיִם וַיַּרְאֶה`), which establishes a literary parallel and reinforces His sovereign authority. The chiasmus in the second colon—“*hāyesh māśkîl dōreš ’et ’elōhîm*”—beautifully balances the subject (the one who has understanding) with the object sought (God), emphasizing the rarity and value of the one who seeks God.

The question is not rhetorical; it is a divine inquiry. God is searching for a *maskil*, a person of understanding who actively seeks Him. The psalmist uses a common literary device where God’s perspective validates the psalm’s core theological argument, much as in Psalm 33:13-14, where God looks down from heaven to rescue the humble. This verse reframes the problem: the universal corruption described in verse 1 is not hidden from God; He is actively aware and is searching, however fruitlessly, for righteousness.

### **Verse 3**

**הַכֹּל סָר יַחְדָּוֹ נֶאֱלָחוּ; אֵין עֹשֶה-טוֹב, אֵין גַם-אֶחָד׃**

This verse answers the question from verse 2 with a resounding negative. “*Hakkol sar*” (“all have turned aside”) echoes the language of Isaiah 53:6, which describes a people universally lost in sin. The pairing of *sar* (turned aside) with the rare verb *ne’elachu* (become filthy) creates a powerful image. While the etymology of *ne’elachu* is debated, as BDB notes, its use here is parallel to *hit’îbū* (done abominably). It likely carries connotations of becoming sour, rancid, or polluted, as if a good thing has spoiled. Job 15:16 provides a compelling parallel: `מַה-יִּשְׁתֶה-טָהוּב, כִּי-חֹלָב וְּנֶאֱלָח` (“What is man, that he should be clean? And he that is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?”).

The inclusio created by the repetition of “*’ēin ‘ōseh �ōv*” from verse 1b now closes the opening section, creating a claustrophobic sense of totality. The final addition, “*’ēin gam-eḥad*” (“not even one”), is a hyperbolic intensification that drives home the absolute verdict. This structure powerfully establishes the depth of the problem before the psalm pivots to a solution. The rhythm of the verse is staccato, marked by the hard consonants and short phrases, phonetically mimicking a state of moral chaos.

### **Verse 4**

**הֲלֹא יָדְעוּ כָל-פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן; אֹכְלֵי עַמִּי, אָכְלוּ לֶחֶם; יְהוָה, לֹא קָרָאוּ׃**

Here, the psalmist turns from a universal diagnosis to a specific accusation, shifting from the cosmic to the communal. The poetic logic poses a question to the *po‘ălēi ‘āwen* (“workers of iniquity”), a term frequently used in the Psalms to describe the hostile and oppressive (e.g., Psalm 6:9, 26:5). The central charge is terrifying in its simplicity: they are “*‘okhəle ‘ammi*” (“eaters of my people”). This is not literal cannibalism, but a potent metaphor for social, economic, and spiritual predation. The victims are dehumanized, treated as mere sustenance for the powerful.

The final clause, “*YHWH lō’ qārā’û*” (“the LORD, they do not call upon [Him]”), identifies both the speaker and the object of the predation. The possessive “*‘ammi*” (“my people”) is a clear indicator of the psalmist’s perspective, aligning with the covenantal community. This verse creates a stark “us vs. them” dynamic, framing the conflict in a way that anticipates the prophetic literature (e.g., Jeremiah 12:10: `רֹעֵה מִשְׁפָטִים כִּתְאֵשׁ אֵת-כֹֹת`).

### **Verse 5**

**שָׁם פָחֲדוּ פָחַד; כִּי-אֱלֹהִים בְּדוֹר צַדִּיק׃**

This short, poetic verse is a masterclass in soundplay. The doubling of the noun *pachad* (פָחַד, “fear” or “terror”) creates an onomatopoeic effect, mimicking a shudder or a palpitation. The verb *pāḥaḏ* is intensified by its object, God Himself, making the divine presence the very source of the wicked’s terror. This is not the comforting presence of a refuge, but a terrifying one for those who stand opposed to His will.

The phrase “*bədōr tsadîq*” (“in the circle/generation of the righteous”) is also a powerful image. It suggests that the righteous form a protected community, a sanctuary where God’s presence dwells. The wicked’s terror is not caused by an army but by encountering the sacred space of the godly. This is a vivid personification of divine judgment, where the mere existence of a faithful remnant is a sentence of doom for their oppressors. It is reminiscent of the fear that fell on the Philistines in the presence of the Ark of the Covenant (1 Samuel 5:7-11).

### **Verse 6**

**עַצַת-עָנִי תָבִישׁוּ; כִּי יְהוָה מַחְסֶהוֹ**

This verse presents a classic antithetic parallelism, setting up a stark contrast that is the theological heart of the psalm. “*‘Atsat ‘ani*” (“the counsel of the poor”) is set against the reality of God’s protection. The *‘ani* (poor) in biblical thought is often a technical term for the righteous remnant, the humble and pious whose “counsel” is God’s Law. Their vulnerability is only apparent, for their security rests not in human strategy but in the person of Yahweh, their *maḥseh* (מַחְסֶה, “refuge”).

This theme of God as refuge is a cornerstone of biblical faith, powerfully connecting this psalm to the wider Psalter (e.g., Psalm 46:2, “*Elohim lanu našeh ve-maḥseh la-nu*”). It underscores the central paradox of the psalm: the lowly are scorned by the powerful but are secretly invulnerable because of God’s protection. This verse serves as the bridge from the indictment of the wicked to the prayer for salvation in the final verse.

### **Verse 7**

**מִי-יִתֵּן מִצִּיּוֹן, יְשׁוּעַת יִשְׂרָאֵל; בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה, שְׁבוּת עַמּוֹ; יָגֵל יַעֲקֹב, יִשְׂמַח יִשְׂרָאֵל׃**

The psalm ends with an explosive and unexpected turn. The grim, cynical analysis of human nature is abandoned for a passionate, eschatological prayer. The entire tone shifts from indictment to desperate hope. This pivot is a hallmark of the lament genre, which often moves from complaint to petition. The prayer begins with the “wish-prayer” formula (*mi-yitten*), an expression of deep yearning found elsewhere in the biblical text (e.g., Num. 11:29: `וּמִי־יִתֵּן כָל־עַם יְהוָה נְבִיאִים`).

The focus collapses from the universal (“all humanity”) to the particular: *yiśrā’ēl*, then *ya‘ăqōv*, and finally the passionate doublet, *gam yisəmaḥ yiśrā’ēl*. The source of this salvation is specified with theological precision: *mim-tsiyyōn* (“from Zion”). This is not merely a geographical location but the symbol of God’s dwelling place and the center of His redemptive activity (cf. Psalm 2:6, “*Yet I have set my King on Zion, my holy hill*”). The prayer is for *yəšū‘āh* (יְשׁוּעָה, “salvation”), not just political stability but a comprehensive, divinely orchestrated restoration. This is the psalm’s ultimate theological statement of hope: the universal problem of human corruption is met by a particular, covenantal promise.
