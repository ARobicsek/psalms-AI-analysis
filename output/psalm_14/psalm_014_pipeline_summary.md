## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (6)

1. What is the precise theological nuance of the fool's declaration 'אֵין אֱלֹהִים' (there is no God)? Is it atheistic denial or a claim of God's irrelevance/moral apathy, and how does the LXX rendering 'οὐ εἰμί θεός' influence this interpretation?
2. How does the term 'נָבָל' (nabal, 'fool') function within biblical wisdom literature? Does its use here connect Psalm 14 to themes from Proverbs or Ecclesiastes, suggesting an overlap between the Wisdom and Lament genres?
3. What is the significance of the psalmist's use of 'My people' (עַמִּי) in v. 4? Is this the voice of David the king, the prophetic voice of God, or the psalmist identifying with the divine perspective, and how does this choice affect the psalm's overall rhetoric?
4. Analyze the semantic relationship between the 'lowly' (עָנִי) in v. 6, the 'righteous' (צַדִּיק) in v. 5, and 'My people' (עַמִּי) in v. 4. Are these terms synonymous, or do they represent different facets of the faithful remnant?
5. How does the sudden shift in v. 7 from the bleak assessment of vv. 1-6 to a national prayer for salvation function rhetorically? Is this a typical feature of the lament genre, or does it represent a unique theological statement about the power of eschatological hope?
6. Given the near-identical text of Psalm 53, what are the potential reasons for the duplication within the Psalter? Do the subtle differences (e.g., 'Elohim' vs. 'YHWH') reflect different historical settings or theological emphases within different collections?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (6)

1. What is the precise theological nuance of the fool's declaration 'אֵין אֱלֹהִים' (there is no God), and how does this set the tone for the entire psalm's indictment?
2. How does the chiasmus in verse 2 function poetically and theologically to frame God's search for humanity?
3. Who is the 'I' behind the possessive 'My people' in verse 4, and how does this identification shape the conflict in the psalm?
4. What is the intended effect of the brilliant wordplay 'שָׁם פָּחֲדוּ פָחַד' in verse 5, and does it function as psychological description or eschatological prediction?
5. Analyze the rhetorical and emotional function of the psalm's dramatic pivot in verse 7 from cynical description to an eschatological 'wish-prayer'.
6. Why does the Septuagint in verse 3 massively expand the text by importing quotes from Romans, and what does this reveal about early Christian interpretation of the psalm?
