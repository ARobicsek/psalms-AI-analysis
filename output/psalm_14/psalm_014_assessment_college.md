# Editorial Assessment (College Edition) - Psalm 14

The current draft has some real strengths. It takes the Hebrew seriously, uses good lexical tools (like BDB), and notices important things: the movement from universal corruption to Zionic hope, the repeated “אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב,” and the tight relationship with Psalm 53. It also rightly stresses that “אָמַר נָבָל בְּלִבּוֹ אֵין אֱלֹהִים” is about practical godlessness, not modern philosophical atheism.

But for a first‑year college student, especially one with strong Hebrew, there are problems:

- The tone is too “dissertation-esque”: phrases like “masterclass in theological architecture” and “eschatological hope” pile up without being unpacked. Technical terms like *inclusio*, *chiasmus*, and “wish‑prayer formula” appear with little or no explanation.
- The commentary often tells you *that* something is brilliant instead of *showing* why, with close reading of the Hebrew.
- Some great material from the research bundle is underused:  
  • Torah Temimah’s link between Ps 14:1 and “אַחֲרֵי לְבַבְכֶם” (Berakhot 12b) is fascinating and never mentioned.  
  • Traditional readings that see Nebuchadnezzar, Titus, or Sennacherib behind the psalm are only lightly alluded to.  
  • Figurative “eating people” imagery has rich biblical parallels (e.g. Deut 7:16) that could be quoted in Hebrew and English.
- The liturgical section is vague (“not prominent”) and doesn’t actually show the Hebrew of prayers where related phrases occur.
- Psalm 53 is said to be a “twin,” but the implications of the different divine names and different book-positions in the Psalter are not spelled out.
- The macro questions raised by the analysts (e.g., “Who says עַמִּי?” “How do עָנִי / צַדִּיק / עַמִּי relate?”) are only partly answered.

In revision, the introduction needs to be less breathless, more conversational, and much clearer on basic terms. The verse‑by‑verse commentary should slow down over key Hebrew words and poetic moves, quote parallels, and keep explaining the “why”: why this verb, why this image, why this structure. And the liturgical use must be concrete: actual psalm and siddur lines in Hebrew and English, with a brief explanation of where and why they’re used.
