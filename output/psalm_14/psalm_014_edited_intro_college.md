### A quick map of what we’re reading

Psalm 14 is only seven verses long, but it does something surprisingly ambitious in that short space.

1. **Verses 1–3**: Start with one person—the “fool”—who says in his heart “אֵין אֱלֹהִים” (“There is no God”), then quickly expand that attitude into a sweeping verdict: *everyone* has turned aside, “אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב” (“there is no one who does good”).
2. **Verses 2–3**: God “looks down from heaven” to check whether that’s actually true. The result: depressingly, yes.
3. **Verses 4–6**: The camera zooms in. Instead of “all humanity” in the abstract, we now see specific evildoers devouring “עַמִּי” (“my people”) and mocking the “עָנִי” (“poor/lowly”) who trust in God.
4. **Verse 7**: The tone flips: “מִי־יִתֵּן מִצִּיּוֹן יְשׁוּעַת יִשְׂרָאֵל”—“O that deliverance for Israel might come from Zion!” The psalm ends not in despair but in a wish‑prayer for national restoration: “בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה שְׁבוּת עַמּוֹ יָגֵל יַעֲקֹב יִשְׂמַח יִשְׂרָאֵל.”

So you get a movement from **universal moral pessimism** to **particular hope for Israel from Zion**. That movement is the main “argument” of the poem.

### Who is the “fool,” and what does he mean by “no God”?

The key character is the נָבָל (*naval*). BDB (the Brown‑Driver‑Briggs Hebrew‑English Lexicon) glosses נָבָל as someone “foolish, senseless,” especially in a **moral and religious** sense. Think: not “low IQ,” but “ethically numb and spiritually tone‑deaf.”

You can see this elsewhere:

- Deut 32:6 scolds Israel:  
  “הַ־יְהוָה תִּגְמְלוּ־זֹאת עַם נָבָל וְלֹא חָכָם”  
  “Is this how you repay the LORD, O foolish and unwise people?”
- Isa 32:5 contrasts “נָבָל” with “נָדִיב” (a noble/generous person).

In 1 Sam 25, the man actually named Nabal is rich but mean, and his own wife says, “כִּשְׁמוֹ כֶּן הוּא; נָבָל שְׁמוֹ, וּנְבָלָה עִמּוֹ” — “As his name is, so is he; Nabal [‘Fool’] is his name, and folly is with him” (v. 25). Same idea.

So when Psalm 14 opens:

> אָמַר נָבָל בְּלִבּוֹ: אֵין אֱלֹהִים  
> “The fool says in his heart: ‘There is no God’”

we’re not in a modern atheist debate. The point is: in his *inner attitude* (בְּלִבּוֹ, “in his heart”), he lives as if there is **no effective divine judge**, no moral oversight. Torah Temimah, citing Berakhot 12b, links this with “אַחֲרֵי לְבַבְכֶם” in the Shema: “after your hearts” = heresy; “after your eyes” = sexual sin. The “fool” is the person whose *heart* quietly concludes, “No God that I need to reckon with.”

Other texts use the same language with this sense of “no God who matters”:

- Ps 10:4: “אֵין אֱלֹהִים כׇּל־מְזִמּוֹתָיו” — “All his schemes say: ‘There is no God [who will call me to account].’”
- 2 Kgs 1:3: Elijah asks the messengers of Ahaziah, “הֲמִבְּלִי אֵין־אֱלֹהִים בְּיִשְׂרָאֵל…?” — “Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal‑zebub?” Obviously he doesn’t mean literal atheism; he means, “You’re acting as if Israel’s God is irrelevant.”

That’s the nuance in Psalm 14: “No God (who matters for my behavior).” The rest of the psalm is basically God’s rebuttal to that attitude.

### From “everyone is corrupt” to “God is with the lowly”

Verses 1–3 pile up ugly verbs:

- “הִשְׁחִיתוּ” — “they have corrupted / ruined” (used in Gen 6:11–12 for the corruption of the earth before the Flood).
- “הִתְעִיבוּ עֲלִילָה” — “they have done something abominable / made their deeds disgusting.”
- “נֶאֱלָחוּ” (v. 3) — a rare verb probably meaning “become foul, rancid,” like spoiled food.

The picture is not “harmless little sins” but active rot. Verse 2 then imagines God “peeking down”:

> יְהוָה מִשָּׁמַיִם הִשְׁקִיף עַל־בְּנֵי־אָדָם  
> לִרְאוֹת הֲיֵשׁ מַשְׂכִּיל דֹּרֵשׁ אֶת־אֱלֹהִים׃  

The verb הִשְׁקִיף means “to look down from above” (used of God in Gen 19:28, Deut 26:15). God is scanning “בְּנֵי־אָדָם” (“human beings”) to find “מַשְׂכִּיל דֹּרֵשׁ אֶת־אֱלֹהִים” — “a wise/understanding person who seeks God.”

Notice the little symmetry (what people call “chiasm,” a mirror pattern):

- הֲיֵשׁ **מַשְׂכִּיל**  
- **דֹּרֵשׁ** אֶת־אֱלֹהִים

The “understanding one” is defined as the one who “seeks God.” Wisdom here is not IQ; it’s obedience and God‑seeking. But verse 3 answers with a harsh echo of verse 1: “אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב, אֵין גַּם־אֶחָד” — “There is no one who does good, not even one.”

Then the poem suddenly zooms in. Instead of “all humanity” in the clouds, we’re on the ground with a very specific crime:

> הֲלֹא יָדְעוּ כׇּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן  
> אֹכְלֵי עַמִּי אָכְלוּ לֶחֶם  
> יְהוָה לֹא קָרָאוּ׃ (v. 4)

“Workers of iniquity” (פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן) are “eating my people as they eat bread.” In biblical Hebrew, “to eat” (אָכַל) can be a metaphor for **destroying** someone:

- Deut 7:16: “וְאָכַלְתָּ אֶת־כׇּל־הָעַמִּים” — literally “you shall eat all the peoples,” meaning “wipe them out in battle.”
- Mic 3:3 accuses corrupt leaders: “וַאֲשֶׁר אָכְלוּ שְׁאֵר עַמִּי” — “who eat the flesh of my people.”

Here the exploiters “devour” Israel the way you casually chew bread—without a second thought. And the possessive “עַמִּי” (“my people”) strongly suggests we’re hearing **God’s** perspective, as many commentators (Rashi, Radak, Meiri) say: God is watching oppressors chew on “my people” and ignore me (“יְהוָה לֹא קָרָאוּ”).

Verse 5 then flips the emotional script:

> שָׁם פָּחֲדוּ פָחַד  
> כִּי־אֱלֹהִים בְּדוֹר צַדִּיק׃  

“שָׁם פָּחֲדוּ פָחַד” literally, “There they feared a fear.” The doubled root פ–ח–ד (פָּחֲדוּ פָחַד) makes a nice shuddering sound. The wicked, who felt zero fear while exploiting “my people,” suddenly panic when they realize “אֱלֹהִים בְּדוֹר צַדִּיק” — “God is in the generation (or circle) of the righteous.”

Then verse 6 contrasts two vantage points:

> עֲצַת עָנִי תָבִישׁוּ;  
> כִּי יְהוָה מַחְסֵהוּ׃  

“You shame the counsel of the poor, but the LORD is his refuge.”  

“עָנִי” is the poor/afflicted person, often a nickname in the Psalms for the **pious underclass** — people with no human power who cling to God (see Ps 34:7, 35:10). His “counsel” is his strategy: to take refuge (מַחֲסֶה, “shelter”) in God. The oppressors mock that plan as naïve. The psalm insists it’s actually the *only* good strategy, because God really does stand “in the circle of the righteous.”

So the big middle of the psalm (vv. 4–6) is: the same God who was supposedly “absent” (אֵין אֱלֹהִים) is in fact standing right in the middle of this despised, exploited little community.

### The surprise ending: a wish for Zion

Given all that, verse 7 could have gone dark: “Curse the fools; may they choke on their bread.” Instead we get:

> מִי־יִתֵּן מִצִּיּוֹן יְשׁוּעַת יִשְׂרָאֵל;  
> בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה שְׁבוּת עַמּוֹ,  
> יָגֵל יַעֲקֹב, יִשְׂמַח יִשְׂרָאֵל׃  

“מִי־יִתֵּן” is a standard Hebrew **wish formula** — literally “Who will give…?” but used as “Oh, that…!” You see it in Num 11:29:

> “וּמִי־יִתֵּן כׇּּל־עַם יְהוָה נְבִיאִים”  
> “O that all the LORD’s people were prophets!”

Here the wish is: “O that salvation for Israel would come from Zion!” “Zion” is not just a hill; it’s shorthand for **God’s presence dwelling with His people**, especially in the Temple. So the psalmist doesn’t just wish for things to “get better”; he wants **a restoration centered on God’s presence**.

“בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה שְׁבוּת עַמּוֹ” uses the idiom שׁוּב + שְׁבוּת. The noun שְׁבוּת can come from “captivity” (שׁבה) or “turning” (שׁוב); in practice it means “fortunes” or “state of affairs.” The phrase appears all over the Bible:

- Deut 30:3: “וְשָׁב יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ אֶת שְׁבוּתְךָ”  
- Job 42:10: “וַיהוָה שָׁב אֶת־שְׁבוּת אִיּוֹב”

So: “When the LORD restores the fortunes of His people” — when He flips their story — “Jacob will exult, Israel will rejoice.” The names “יַּעֲקֹב / יִשְׂרָאֵל” pile up affectionately, like saying “when Mom comes home, Sarah will dance, little Sarah will laugh.”

Theologically, that last verse answers the question, “Is the world just fools chewing on the righteous forever?” The answer is no: **God’s hidden presence with the lowly will eventually become a visible, public salvation from Zion.**

### Psalm 14 and its twin, Psalm 53

Psalm 53 is almost a copy‑paste of Psalm 14. The differences are tiny but interesting:

- Psalm 14 lives in **Book I** of the Psalter (Pss 1–41), which is heavy on the divine name יְהוָה.  
- Psalm 53 is in **Book II** (Pss 42–72), the “Elohistic Psalter,” where editors systematically prefer אֱלֹהִים. So in Ps 53 the same verses say “אֱלֹהִים מִשָּׁמַיִם הִשְׁקִיף…” and “בְּשׁוּב אֱלֹהִים שְׁבוּת עַמּוֹ…”
- Psalm 53 slightly tweaks some phrases (e.g. “מִצִּיּוֹן יְשֻׁעוֹת יִשְׂרָאֵל” — plural “deliverances”).

Traditional commentators often connect Ps 14 to specific historical crises (Nebuchadnezzar, Titus, Sennacherib), and Ps 53 to others. On a literary level, you can say the canon gives you the same poem twice, once with a very **covenantal** flavor (YHWH, Zion, Jacob, Israel) and once in a more **general “God” language**. That suggests the message is not tied to one moment; it’s a reusable prayer for any time God’s “fools” seem to be winning.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

#### Phrases

Even though Psalm 14 isn’t a star of the siddur the way Psalms 27 or 145 are, its vocabulary shows up in important places.

1. **כׇּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן – “all workers of iniquity”**

Our psalm:  
“הֲלֹא יָדְעוּ כׇּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן אֹכְלֵי עַמִּי…” (Ps 14:4) —  
“Are they so witless, all the workers of iniquity, who devour my people…?”

Very close wording reappears in **Psalm 92**, the psalm for Shabbat:

> “בִּפְרֹחַ רְשָׁעִים כְּמוֹ עֵשֶׂב,  
> וַיַּצִּיצוּ כׇּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן;  
> לְהִשָּׁמְדָם עֲדֵי־עַד.” (Ps 92:8)  
> “When the wicked sprout like grass, and all workers of iniquity blossom—it is for their destruction forever.”

Psalm 92 is recited **every Shabbat morning** as “מִזְמוֹר שִׁיר לְיוֹם הַשַּׁבָּת,” both in *Pesukei de‑Zimra* (verses of praise) and again as the Shabbat *Shir Shel Yom*. So each week, the congregation voices the idea behind Psalm 14: “workers of iniquity” may flourish for a moment, but God will judge.

2. **יִשְׂמַח יִשְׂרָאֵל – “Israel will rejoice”**

Our psalm ends:  
“יָגֵל יַעֲקֹב, יִשְׂמַח יִשְׂרָאֵל” — “Jacob will exult, Israel will rejoice” (14:7).

That exact pairing “יִשְׂמַח יִשְׂרָאֵל” appears in Psalm 149:2, which is said in *Pesukei de‑Zimra* daily:

> “יִשְׂמַח יִשְׂרָאֵל בְּעֹשָׂיו; בְּנֵי צִיּוֹן יָגִילוּ בְמַלְכָּם׃”  
> “Let Israel rejoice in its Maker; let the children of Zion exult in their King.”

When you recite Ps 149, you’re echoing Ps 14’s closing hope: Israel rejoicing in Zion because God has acted for them.

These liturgical echoes mean that, even if you never say Psalm 14 straight through in shul, you still sing its world: the contrast between “workers of iniquity” and the rejoicing of Israel in Zion shows up every week and every day.
