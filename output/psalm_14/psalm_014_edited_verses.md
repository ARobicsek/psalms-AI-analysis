**Verse 1**

לַמְנַצֵּחַ לְדָוִד;  
אָמַר נָבָל בְּלִבּוֹ, אֵין אֱלֹהִים;  
הִשְׁחִיתוּ, הִתְעִיבוּ עֲלִילָה;  
אֵין עֹשֶׂה־טוֹב.

The superscription, “לַמְנַצֵּחַ לְדָוִד” (“For the leader; of David”), ties the psalm to the Davidic collection and to temple performance. *Lamnatseach* probably designates the director of music; the poem is not just private reflection but public liturgy.

The opening declaration, “אָמַר נָבָל בְּלִבּוֹ, אֵין אֱלֹהִים” — “the *nāvāl* has said in his heart, ‘There is no God,’” is carefully staged. The speech is internal (“in his heart”), not proclaimed. The term נָבָל carries a specific moral weight. BDB defines it as “fool, senseless,” especially in a religious-ethical sense, with the “collateral idea of ignoble, disgraceful.” Isaiah 32:6 explains:

> כִּי נָבָל נְבָלָה יְדַבֵּר,  
> וְלִבּוֹ יַעֲשֶׂה אָוֶן…  

“For the fool speaks folly,  
and his heart works iniquity…”

Likewise Deuteronomy rebukes: “הֲ־לַיְהוָה תִּגְמְלוּ זֹאת, עַם נָבָל וְלֹא חָכָם” — “Is this how you repay YHWH, you foolish and unwise people?” (Deut. 32:6). Psalm 14’s *nāvāl* stands in that moral tradition: he is not gullibly stupid but willfully perverse.

“אֵין אֱלֹהִים” in this context means, more precisely, “there is no governing God here.” The same phrase recurs in Psalm 10:4:

> רָשָׁע כְּגֹבַהּ אַפּוֹ, בַּל יִדְרֹשׁ;  
> אֵין אֱלֹהִים, כָּל מְזִמּוֹתָיו.  

“The wicked, in the height of his anger, does not seek.  
‘There is no God’—so are all his schemes.”

There, the point is not metaphysical atheism but a practical conclusion: no one will call me to account.

Rabbinic tradition takes the line as the classic statement of heresy. Berakhot 12b, as cited by the Torah Temimah, comments on the tzitzit paragraph’s warning “לֹא תָתוּרוּ אַחֲרֵי לְבַבְכֶם” — “do not stray after your hearts,” that this refers to *minut* (sectarian belief), “as it is said, ‘אָמַר נָבָל בְּלִבּוֹ, אֵין אֱלֹהִים.’” The fool’s heart is not just a private space; it is the seedbed of behavior.

The psalm immediately shifts from the singular fool to a plural “they”: “הִשְׁחִיתוּ, הִתְעִיבוּ עֲלִילָה; אֵין עֹשֶׂה־טוֹב.” The pair of verbs intensifies the picture. *Hishḥîtū* (הִשְׁחִיתוּ) is the Hiphil form of שׁחת, used of active destruction (“he ruined, spoiled”). In Genesis 6 it describes a world so morally rotten that God must unmake it: “וַתִּשָּׁחֵת הָאָרֶץ לִפְנֵי הָאֱלֹהִים” — “the earth was corrupted before God” (Gen. 6:11). *Hit’îvū* (הִתְעִיבוּ) is the Hitpael of תָּעַב, “to make abominable.” In Job 9:31 it appears of being made an abomination through filth; in our psalm it governs עֲלִילָה (“deed, exploit”), suggesting deeds fit for the category *to‘evah*.

The climactic “אֵין עֹשֶׂה־טוֹב” (“there is none who does good”) universalizes what began as one person’s inner fantasy. It is also the phrase that will close the opening section in v. 3, forming an envelope around vv. 1–3. The rhetoric is hyperbolic—there are “righteous” and “poor” elsewhere in the psalm—but hyperbole is part of lament’s grammar: to cry out from injustice is to feel, for a moment, that goodness has vanished from the earth.

**Verse 2**

יְהוָה מִשָּׁמַיִם הִשְׁקִיף עַל־בְּנֵי אָדָם;  
לִרְאוֹת הֲיֵשׁ מַשְׂכִּיל, דֹּרֵשׁ אֶת־אֱלֹהִים.

The second verse stages a stark contrast between the fool’s inward whisper and God’s outward gaze. “יְהוָה מִשָּׁמַיִם הִשְׁקִיף” — “YHWH, from heaven, looked down.” The verb הִשְׁקִיף (*hišqîf*) is vivid: to lean out and look down from an elevated vantage point. It appears when Abraham “looks out” over the smoking plain (Gen. 19:28), when Balaam is brought to a hill that “overlooks” the wilderness (Num. 23:28), and, importantly, with God as subject: “וַיַּשְׁקֵף יְהוָה אֶל־מַחֲנֵה מִצְרַיִם” — “YHWH looked down upon the camp of the Egyptians” at the Red Sea (Ex. 14:24). The image is of judicial inspection: the heavenly king surveying his realm.

The object of this inspection is “בְּנֵי אָדָם” — literally “sons of Adam,” an intentionally generic label. He looks “לִרְאוֹת הֲיֵשׁ מַשְׂכִּיל” — “to see whether there is one who behaves wisely.” The participle מַשְׂכִּיל comes from שׂכל, a root meaning “to be prudent, to act circumspectly.” In Proverbs it marks the sensible actor: “עֶבֶד מַשְׂכִּיל יִמְשֹׁל בְּבֵן מֵבִישׁ” — “A prudent servant will rule over a disgraceful son” (Prov. 17:2). Wisdom here is not abstract intelligence but behavior grounded in reality.

The second term, “דֹּרֵשׁ אֶת־אֱלֹהִים,” defines the first: the one who is truly *maskîl* is the one who “seeks God.” To “seek” (דרשׁ) God is covenantal language: it involves inquiry, worship, and obedience. Chronicles tells of a time when “לֹא דֹרֵשׁ וְאֵין תּוֹרָה” — “there was no seeking and no teaching” (2 Chr. 15:3), as a shorthand for religious breakdown.

The structure of the verse is what literary critics call a “staircase parallelism” or “synthetic parallelism”: the second colon does not restate but completes the thought of the first. “YHWH looks down from heaven… to see whether there is *anyone* who acts wisely, *namely* one who seeks God.” The “A is so, and what’s more, B” dynamic is clear: the general category (wisdom) is filled with a specific content (seeking God).

In the context of v. 1, this verse answers the fool’s heart with a divine counter‑intention. The fool says in his heart “no God”; God, for his part, searches human hearts for anyone who will say “yes” by seeking Him. The tragedy, as v. 3 will reveal, is that this search appears fruitless.

**Verse 3**

הַכֹּל סָר; יַחְדָּו נֶאֱלָחוּ;  
אֵין עֹשֶׂה־טוֹב, אֵין גַּם־אֶחָד.

Here we hear God’s verdict on the search of v. 2. “הַכֹּל סָר” — “the whole [lot] has turned aside.” The verb סוּר (“to turn aside”) is often used morally: “סָרוּ מַהֵר מִן־הַדֶּרֶךְ” — “they have quickly turned aside from the way” (Ex. 32:8). Isaiah 53:6 uses the same image in a communal confession: “כֻּלָּנוּ כַּצֹּאן תָּעִינוּ, אִישׁ לְדַרְכּוֹ פָּנִינוּ” — “All we like sheep have gone astray; each has turned to his own way.”

“יַחְדָּו נֶאֱלָחוּ” is more obscure. The verb אָלַח occurs only here, in the parallel Psalm 53:4, and in Job 15:16 (as an adjective). Most lexicons take it to mean “become filthy, tainted.” Job’s “נֶאֱלָח” man “drinks iniquity like water” (Job 15:16). There, the pairing “נִתְעָב וְנֶאֱלָח” (“abhorred and corrupt”) suggests physical and moral rot. Psalm 14 borrows that flavor: the human community has gone rancid together.

The refrain “אֵין עֹשֶׂה־טוֹב, אֵין גַּם־אֶחָד” closes the inclusio begun in v. 1. The first clause repeats “there is none who does good”; the addition “אֵין גַּם־אֶחָד” (“not even one”) intensifies the negation. The effect is claustrophobic: between the two refrains, the whole human scene is enclosed in corruption.

Historically, Jewish interpreters have not read this as a denial that there are any righteous individuals; the psalm itself will speak of a “דור צדיק” (“generation of the righteous,” v. 5) and of the “עני” who trusts in YHWH (v. 6). Rather, the verse is heard as a vision of how things look when violence and injustice are ascendant—when the public order and its rulers are, in the main, bent away from God. The LXX’s expansion (incorporated into Romans 3) elaborates this into a comprehensive diagnosis, but the Hebrew poet is content with a grim generalization: as a body, humanity has veered off.

**Verse 4**

הֲלֹא יָדְעוּ כָּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן,  
אֹכְלֵי עַמִּי אָכְלוּ לֶחֶם;  
יְהוָה לֹא קָרָאוּ.

The psalm now breaks into direct, incredulous address. “הֲלֹא יָדְעוּ…?”—“Do they not know…?” The target is “כָּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן,” “all workers of trouble/iniquity.” The noun אָוֶן spans mischief, trouble, and moral evil (see Ps. 7:15; 10:7). In prophetic satire, Bethel, corrupted by idolatry, is renamed “בֵּית אָוֶן” — “house of iniquity” (Hos. 4:15).

These evil‑doers are further characterized as “אֹכְלֵי עַמִּי אָכְלוּ לֶחֶם” — “those who devour my people as they eat bread.” The particle “as” is implicit: the parallelism assumes it—devouring people with the same ease and thoughtlessness as eating a meal. As noted in the introduction, the Bible often uses “eating” as metaphor for exploitation or conquest. One sharp parallel is Micah 3:2–3, where leaders “אֲשֶׁר אֲכַלְתֶּם שְׁאֵרִי” — “you have eaten my flesh”—and “שְׁאַר עַמִּי יָאכֵלוּ” — “they eat the flesh of my people,” stripping skin and breaking bones. Deuteronomy 7:16 uses it of total military defeat.

The figurative pattern typically involves three elements: (1) a group with power, (2) a vulnerable group likened to food, and (3) an implied obliviousness or cruelty. Our psalm fits the mold: “workers of iniquity” eat “my people” and in so doing “do not call on YHWH.” They neither seek God (contrast v. 2) nor credit Him as the source of their gains.

Who is the “I” behind “my people”? Traditional Jewish readings often hear God. Rashi, reading the psalm about Nebuchadnezzar and his successors, glosses “אֹכְלֵי עַמִּי” as “the seed of Nebuchadnezzar,” devouring Israel. Radak generalizes: any nation that oppresses Israel is in effect eating God’s people. Others, including some modern scholars, allow that the psalmist—perhaps the king—speaks on God’s behalf: “my people” as the community with whom he identifies and for whom he prays.

The Torah Temimah notes an intriguing midrashic use of this verse in Sanhedrin 104b. There the Rabbis ask why, in the acrostic of Lamentations, the letter פ (peh, “mouth”) comes before ע (ayin, “eye”), unlike the normal order. They answer: because the spies “said with their mouths what their eyes had not seen,” citing among other verses “אֹכְלֵי עַמִּי אָכְלוּ לֶחֶם; יְהוָה לֹא קָרָאוּ.” The association is thematic rather than literal: in both cases, speech detached from truthful perception leads to communal disaster, and in both, God is left uncalled upon.

“יְהוָה לֹא קָרָאוּ” — “they have not called on YHWH” — closes the accusation. In biblical idiom, to “call on the name of YHWH” is to worship, to appeal to, and to depend upon Him (Gen. 4:26; Joel 3:5). The devourers’ eating and their godlessness are two sides of a single disposition: they treat the world as a field for their appetite, answerable to no one.

**Verse 5**

שָׁם פָּחֲדוּ פָחַד;  
כִּי־אֱלֹהִים בְּדוֹר צַדִּיק.

“שָׁם פָּחֲדוּ פָחַד” is compact and musical. Literally, “There they feared a fear.” The repetition of פ (p), ח (ḥ), and ד (d), with its double stress — `**SHĀM** **PĀ**‑ḥa-dhū **FĀ**‑ḥadh` — gives the line an almost onomatopoetic tremor, as if we were hearing the stutter of panic. The adverb “שָׁם” (“there”) is deliberately vague: where they once felt utterly secure, in that very “there” they will be seized by dread.

The Masoretic Text continues simply, “כִּי־אֱלֹהִים בְּדוֹר צַדִּיק” — “for God is in the generation of the righteous.” Psalm 53:6, the parallel, adds a phrase: “פַחַד לֹא־הָיָה פָחַד” — “a terror where there was no terror”—echoed in the LXX of our psalm. That expanded form underlies later quotations (e.g., in early Christian usage). The shorter Hebrew version we have preserves the underlying logic: the wicked’s fear is explained by the discovery that “God is with” (or “in”) the righteous generation they scorned.

Who are this “דור צדיק” (“generation of the righteous”)? Verse 6 will identify them with the “עני,” the poor who make YHWH their refuge. The phrase “generation” often marks a cohort whose defining trait is either wickedness or fidelity (cf. Ps. 12:8, “דור זוּ לֹא יָשִׁית לִבּוֹ,” “a generation that does not set its heart aright”). Here the righteous are a minority remnant, but God’s presence in their midst turns history’s balance.

Traditional commentators again historicize. Rashi, hearing the psalm speak of Belshazzar, points to Daniel 5:6, where the Babylonian king’s “קִטְרֵי חֲרַצֵּהּ מִשְׁתָּרִין” — “the joints of his loins were loosened” — when the writing appears on the wall. Meiri similarly sees in “שָׁם פָּחֲדוּ פָחַד” a hint of Belshazzar’s terror and of Nebuchadnezzar’s madness, “for God [was] in the generation of the righteous” — Daniel and his companions. The point of such readings is less to fix a date than to affirm a pattern: empires that devour God’s people eventually find themselves trembling.

Theologically, the verse offers the psalm’s first explicit note of reversal. Up to now we have seen only the confidence of the oppressors and the vulnerability of “my people.” Now the camera flashes forward to a time when those who denied God’s governance will be confronted, unexpectedly, with evidence that He has been siding with their victims all along.

**Verse 6**

עֲצַת־עָנִי תָבִישׁוּ;  
כִּי יְהוָה מַחְסֵהוּ.

The scene remains a confrontation, but now in direct second person: “עֲצַת־עָנִי תָבִישׁוּ” — “The counsel of the poor you shame.” The “poor” (*‘ānî*) in biblical poetry is not simply one with little money. The root ענה in its adjectival form often denotes the afflicted, the humble, those unable to defend themselves against abuse. Psalm 10:2–3 speaks of “בְּגַאֲוַת רָשָׁע יִדְלַק עָנִי” — “in the pride of the wicked the poor is hotly pursued.”

What is the poor person’s “counsel” (*‘atsah*)? Radak and Metzudat David see it as his basic plan for survival: to trust in God. In that light, the second colon is explanatory: “כִּי יְהוָה מַחְסֵהוּ” — “for YHWH is his refuge.” The very strategy the wicked mock—placing confidence not in military alliances, bribes, or flattery, but in divine protection—is the strategy the psalm endorses.

“מַחְסֶה” (*maḥseh*, “refuge”) is a central metaphor in the Psalms. Psalm 46:2 declares, “אֱלֹהִים לָנוּ מַחֲסֶה וָעֹז, עֶזְרָה בְצָרוֹת נִמְצָא מְאֹד” — “God is for us a refuge and strength, a help very readily found in trouble.” Psalm 61:4 has the psalmist ask, “תְּהִי לִי לְצוּר מָעוֹז… מָעוֹן מִשְׂגָּב מִפְּנֵי אוֹיֵב” — “Be to me a rock of refuge… a stronghold against the enemy.” The image is architectural: a shelter against storms or attackers. Here the metaphor is sharpened by contrast: what the poor have that the powerful lack is not resources but a hiding place “in” God.

Rashi paraphrases sharply: “You say that the counsel of Israel is shameful, because they trust in YHWH, for YHWH is his refuge.” That is, from the oppressor’s perspective, it is ridiculous to rely on an invisible deity when realpolitik demands tribute and arms. The psalm replies that in the long run, this “ridiculous” counsel will be vindicated when “there [the oppressors] fear a great fear” (v. 5).

Meiri hears behind the verse the voice of Jews in exile whose seventy-year hope for return (Jeremiah’s prophecy) seems still unfulfilled. Their enemies, he suggests, mocked their calculations and declared their trust in God to be baseless. Psalm 14 answers that such mockery misunderstands the story. The delay of visible help does not annul the reality that “YHWH is his refuge.”

The shift in pronouns is also worth noting. “You” (plural) addresses the oppressors; “his” (singular) in “מַחְסֵהוּ” points to the individual poor person. The psalm moves from macro-diagnosis (“all have turned aside”) to the micro-drama of one afflicted person’s trust, and how that trust looks from different vantage points.

**Verse 7**

מִי־יִתֵּן מִצִּיּוֹן, יְשׁוּעַת יִשְׂרָאֵל;  
בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה שְׁבוּת עַמּוֹ,  
יָגֵל יַעֲקֹב, יִשְׂמַח יִשְׂרָאֵל.

The final verse is both a sigh and a shout. It begins with the wish formula “מִי־יִתֵּן” — “O that…!” Literally, “Who will give… from Zion deliverance for Israel?” The idiom recurs in poignant places. Moses cries, “וּמִי־יִתֵּן כָּל־עַם יְהוָה נְבִיאִים” — “Would that all YHWH’s people were prophets” (Num. 11:29). Job exclaims, “מִי־יִתֵּן בִּשְׁאוֹל תַּצְפִנֵנִי” — “O that You would hide me in Sheol” (Job 14:13). The phrase signals deep desire rather than a request in formal prayer language.

The object of desire is “יְשׁוּעַת יִשְׂרָאֵל” — “the deliverance of Israel.” The verb ישׁע (“to save, deliver”) is the root behind the later name Yehoshua / Jesus; here it carries its straightforward sense of rescue from oppression. The source is “מִצִּיּוֹן” (“from Zion”), the mountain where the temple stands, emblematic of God’s earthly dwelling and Davidic kingship. Psalm 2 correlates kingship and Zion: “וַאֲנִי נָסַכְתִּי מַלְכִּי, עַל־צִיּוֹן הַר קָדְשִׁי” — “I have installed my king on Zion, my holy mountain” (Ps. 2:6). Our psalm answers the global diagnosis of vv. 1–3 not with a general moral improvement plan but with a specific hope: that God will act from Zion on behalf of His people.

“בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה שְׁבוּת עַמּוֹ” contains an idiom that deserves comment. The combination of שׁוּב (“return, restore”) with שְׁבוּת or שְׁבִית (“captivity, fortune”) means “to restore fortunes” or “to bring back captives.” BDB notes its use both for Israel and other nations. Deuteronomy 30:3 promises, “וְשָׁב יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ אֶת־שְׁבוּתְךָ” — “YHWH your God will restore your fortunes.” Amos 9:14 has, “וְשַׁבְתִּי אֶת־שְׁבוּת עַמִּי יִשְׂרָאֵל” — “I will restore the fortunes of My people Israel.” Psalm 126:1, beloved in liturgy, echoes: “בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה אֶת־שִׁיבַת צִיּוֹן, הָיִינוּ כְּחֹלְמִים” — “When YHWH restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like dreamers.”

In Psalm 14 the restoration is still future, framed by the wish “מִי־יִתֵּן.” When that restoration comes, says the psalm, “יָגֵל יַעֲקֹב, יִשְׂמַח יִשְׂרָאֵל.” The double name—Jacob/Israel—is characteristic of poetic parallelism and likely carries connotations of the nation in its vulnerability (Jacob) and in its covenant dignity (Israel). The verbs reinforce joy: *yāgēl* (יָגֵל) suggests spinning or exulting; *yismaḥ* (יִשְׂמַח) is “rejoice.”

Comparing Psalm 14:7 with its twin in Psalm 53:7 is instructive. There, the line reads: “מִי יִתֵּן מִצִּיּוֹן יְשׁוּעוֹת יִשְׂרָאֵל” — “O that from Zion salvations for Israel would come.” The plural “יְשׁוּעוֹת” (“deliverances”) may suggest repeated acts of rescue, or simply intensify the notion of salvation. Psalm 53 also has “בְּשׁוּב אֱלֹהִים שְׁבוּת עַמּוֹ” — “when Elohim restores the fortunes of his people,” instead of “בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה.” The shift from the personal name YHWH to the more generic “Elohim” is a hallmark of the so‑called Elohistic Psalter (Pss. 42–83), suggesting Psalm 53 is an adaptation of Psalm 14 for that collection.

Liturgically and theologically, this verse quietly pulls the psalm out of mere pessimism. If one read only vv. 1–3, the psalm might seem to affirm a near‑nihilistic view of humanity. Verses 4–6 complicate that by insisting on God’s solidarity with the afflicted. Verse 7 goes further by tying that solidarity to a concrete future: there will be a day when the poor’s mocked “counsel” will be vindicated, and when the community that now laments, “אֵין עֹשֶׂה־טוֹב,” will instead say, “הִגְדִּיל יְהוָה לַעֲשׂוֹת עִם־אֵלֶּה” — “YHWH has done great things for them” (Ps. 126:2).
