#### Verse 1

לַמְנַצֵּחַ לְדָוִד;  
אָמַר נָבָל בְּלִבּוֹ: אֵין אֱלֹהִים.  
הִשְׁחִיתוּ, הִתְעִיבוּ עֲלִילָה;  
אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב׃  

The heading לַמְנַצֵּחַ לְדָוִד (“For the leader; of David”) just tells us this is a Davidic psalm meant for public performance. The action starts immediately with a quote: “אָמַר נָבָל בְּלִבּוֹ: אֵין אֱלֹהִים” — “The fool says in his heart: ‘There is no God.’”

We already saw that נָבָל (naval) is not about brains but about **moral and spiritual stupidity**. Deut 32 and Isa 32 use it for people who ignore God’s gifts and obligations. In 1 Sam 25, Nabal’s behavior (stinginess, insult, refusal of hospitality) embodies this character: he lives as if “no God” will judge his actions.

“בְּלִבּוֹ” focuses on the **inner script**: he doesn’t loudly preach atheism; he quietly assumes there is no God whose opinion matters. Torah Temimah (on Berakhot 12b) notes how this lines up with “אַחֲרֵי לְבַבְכֶם” in the Shema: heresy begins as a “heart thing”—a silent attitude—before it ever becomes a philosophy.

The psalmist does something clever with perspective: after quoting the fool, he suddenly shifts to “they”:

> הִשְׁחִיתוּ, הִתְעִיבוּ עֲלִילָה;  
> אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב.

“He *they* have corrupted, they have done abominable deeds; there is none who does good.” The singular fool has many clones. The verbs are strong:

- הִשְׁחִיתוּ (from שׁחת) — to ruin, corrupt, destroy. This is the verb used in Gen 6:12: “כִּי־הִשְׁחִית כׇּּל־בָּשָׂר אֶת־דַּרְכּוֹ” — “for all flesh had corrupted its way.”
- הִתְעִיבוּ (from תָּעַב) — to make something abominable or disgusting. Job 15:16 calls the wicked man “נִתְעָב וְנֶאֱלָח” — “abhorred and foul.”

So the line “they have corrupted, they have made their deeds abominable” says: a heart that says “no God” doesn’t stay neutral; it **leaks out** into disgusting behavior.

Then the last colon: “אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב” — “there is no one who does good.” This is intentionally exaggerated (you and the psalmist both know not literally **no one** ever does any good). But as hyperbole it makes the point: from God’s vantage point, human society is so shot through with injustice that, on the macro level, “no one” is clean.

Notice how “אֵין” (“there is no…”) appears twice in the verse:

- “אֵין אֱלֹהִים” — “no God” (in the fool’s mind).
- “אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב” — “no one doing good” (God’s verdict).

It’s almost like a twisted exchange: *You* say “no God”; *I* say “no goodness.” The psalm will now test whether that’s really so.

#### Verse 2

יְהוָה מִשָּׁמַיִם הִשְׁקִיף עַל־בְּנֵי־אָדָם;  
לִרְאוֹת הֲיֵשׁ מַשְׂכִּיל, דֹּרֵשׁ אֶת־אֱלֹהִים׃  

Here the perspective flips from the fool’s heart to God’s eye. “יְהוָה מִשָּׁמַיִם הִשְׁקִיף” — “The LORD, from heaven, looked down.” The verb הִשְׁקִיף, as BDB notes, is used when someone leans out from a high place and looks down (Judg 5:28, Deut 26:15). It paints a vivid image: God bends over the balcony of heaven to examine human life.

He’s looking “עַל־בְּנֵי־אָדָם” — “upon the children of Adam,” i.e., people in general. But what is He searching for?

> “לִרְאוֹת הֲיֵשׁ מַשְׂכִּיל, דֹּרֵשׁ אֶת־אֱלֹהִים”

“To see whether there is a **maśkil**, one who has understanding, who seeks God (דֹּרֵשׁ אֶת־אֱלֹהִים).”

The noun מַשְׂכִּיל comes from the root שׂכל (to be wise, prudent, act insightfully). It’s the same root as the title “מַשְׂכִּיל” used for didactic psalms. Here, though, it’s not about intellectual analysis; the parallelism shows what wisdom means:

- מַשְׂכִּיל (“one who understands”)  
- דֹּרֵשׁ אֶת־אֱלֹהִים (“one who seeks God”)

That’s a textbook example of **synonymous parallelism**: the second phrase restates and sharpens the first. It quietly defines “wisdom” as **seeking God**, not just knowing many things. The mini‑chiasm (A = wise person, B = seek God) helps link the two ideas tightly.

This verse also corrects the fool’s theology. The fool’s inner monologue: “No God, nobody’s watching.” Verse 2: actually, the LORD is watching very closely. He is not distant; He is inspecting.

One more subtlety: the psalm uses יְהוָה here rather than generic אֱלֹהִים. That’s the **covenant name**, the God of Israel’s history. In Psalm 53 (the “twin”), this line becomes “אֱלֹהִים מִשָּׁמַיִם הִשְׁקִיף” to match that book’s style. Here in Psalm 14, we’re reminded that the God who is looking is not just “a god,” but the same God who brought Israel out of Egypt and into covenant—so what He sees in human injustice matters deeply.

#### Verse 3

הַכֹּל סָר; יַחְדָּו נֶאֱלָחוּ;  
אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב, אֵין גַּם־אֶחָד׃  

Verse 3 gives God’s answer to His own search—and it’s grim. “הַכֹּל סָר” — “All have turned aside.” The verb סָר can mean “turn aside, stray” from a path. It echoes Isa 53:6, “כֻּלָּנוּ כַּצֹּאן תָּעִינוּ; אִישׁ לְדַרְכּוֹ פָּנִינוּ” — “All we like sheep have gone astray; each has turned to his own way.”

“יַחְדָּו נֶאֱלָחוּ” adds a rarer verb: נֶאֱלָחוּ (from אָלַח). BDB glosses it as “be corrupt, tainted, turned foul,” possibly like milk turning sour. The pairing is vivid: they have left the road **and** their character has gone off, like food spoiling.

Again we hit the refrain:

> “אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב, אֵין גַּם־אֶחָד.”

“There is none who does good; there is not even one.”

Notice the structure:

- Opening verdict in v. 1: “אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב”  
- Repeated and intensified in v. 3: “אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב, אֵין גַּם־אֶחָד.”

This repetition forms a kind of **inclusio** (an “envelope” structure) around the opening diagnosis (vv. 1–3). We start and end the section with the same devastating line, now upgraded with “גַּם־אֶחָד” (“not even one”) to sound even more total.

Is the psalm claiming that literally every single human everywhere is equally wicked? In the Psalms themselves, no—there are also צַדִּיקִים (“righteous”), עֲנָוִים (“humble”), חַסִידִים (“faithful”), etc. This verse is **rhetorical**: from the standpoint of justice, society as a whole is crooked. No class or group can say, “We’re the good guys, totally clean.” Later, verse 5 will still be able to speak of a “דּוֹר צַדִּיק,” a generation of the righteous, so clearly the hyperbole is part of the psalm’s emotional punch, not a flat theological treatise.

The Greek Septuagint (LXX) of this verse is huge—it imports extra lines that Paul later quotes in Romans 3 (“their throat is an open grave; with their tongues they have practiced deceit… there is no fear of God before their eyes”). Those expansions are early Christian commentary layered onto the psalm, not part of the Hebrew text, but they show how strongly this “no one does good” line resonated as a picture of human sin.

#### Verse 4

הֲלֹא יָדְעוּ כׇּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן;  
אֹכְלֵי עַמִּי, אָכְלוּ לֶחֶם;  
יְהוָה לֹא קָרָאוּ׃  

Here the poem turns from God’s verdict to a kind of astonished protest: “הֲלֹא יָדְעוּ…?” — “Do they really not know…?” The people in question are “כׇּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן” — “all the workers of trouble/iniquity.” The noun אָוֶן covers both **trouble** and **wickedness**; it’s what the wicked “sow” and then “reap” (Prov 22:8).

What have they done?

> “אֹכְלֵי עַמִּי, אָכְלוּ לֶחֶם”

Literally: “those who eat my people—they have eaten bread.” It sounds weird in English; in Hebrew the idea is: they devour my people **as casually as** they eat bread. This is classic biblical metaphor: eating = **consuming, destroying, exploiting.** Compare:

- Deut 7:16: “וְאָכַלְתָּ אֶת־כׇּל־הָעַמִּים אֲשֶׁר יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ נֹתֵן לָךְ”  
  “You shall eat all the peoples that the LORD your God gives you” — meaning, conquer and wipe them out.
- Mic 3:3: corrupt leaders “וְאָכְלוּ אֵת בְּשַׂר עַמִּי” — “they eat the flesh of my people.”

Here the “eating” is likely social/economic: treating people as resources to chew up: labor, taxes, land grabs, even violent oppression.

Who is speaking when we hear “עַמִּי” (“my people”)? Traditional Jewish commentators mostly take this as **God’s voice**: God calls Israel “עַמִּי” all over the prophets, and verse 7 will explicitly mention “עַמּוֹ” (“His people”). So the verse is probably either (a) God speaking in the first person, or (b) the psalmist speaking *on God’s behalf*, seeing the world from God’s perspective.

The last colon clinches the diagnosis:

> “יְהוָה לֹא קָרָאוּ” — “The LORD they have not called upon.”

They exploit “my people” *and* they ignore me. No prayer, no seeking, no sense that YHWH has any claim on them. That double move—abusing the weak while erasing God—is what makes them “נָבָל.”

Psalm 53:5 has the same verse but swaps “אֱלֹהִים” for “יְהוָה”:

> “…אָכְלוּ לֶחֶם; אֱלֹהִים לֹא קָרָאוּ׃”

So our psalm ties the crime more tightly to the covenant God of Israel (YHWH), fitting its focus on “עַמִּי” and “צִיּוֹן.”

#### Verse 5

שָׁם פָּחֲדוּ פָחַד;  
כִּי־אֱלֹהִים בְּדוֹר צַדִּיק׃  

“שָׁם” (“there”) is deliciously vague: *right there*, at the very place and moment where the oppressors felt totally secure eating God’s people like bread—that’s where “פָּחֲדוּ פָחַד,” “they feared a fear.” The phrase is both a little poetic flourish and a sound effect: the doubled פ–ח–ד (פָּחֲדוּ פָחַד) gives you a kind of stuttering, like someone’s heartbeat jumping.

Psalm 53:6 expands it to “שָׁם פָּחֲדוּ פַחַד לֹא־הָיָה פָחַד” — “There they feared a fear where there was no fear,” emphasizing how irrational and sudden the panic is. Our Psalm 14 stays tighter.

Why the fear?

> “כִּי־אֱלֹהִים בְּדוֹר צַדִּיק”

“Because God is in the generation (or circle) of the righteous.”

“דּוֹר צַדִּיק” can mean either “era of righteous people” or “company of the righteous.” Either way, the idea is: even when the righteous look marginal and powerless (the “עָנִי” of v. 6), **God is present in their midst.** The wicked suddenly realize that the God they wrote off as “אֵין אֱלֹהִים” is *right there* in the community they were trampling.

So you get a strong contrast:

- To the oppressed, God is “מַחְסֵהוּ” (“his refuge,” v. 6) — a shelter.
- To the oppressors, the same presence is sheer terror — the realization that they have picked a fight with the wrong people.

You can compare this to 1 Sam 5: the Philistines capture the Ark, park it in their temple, and then panic as plagues hit them. The presence of Israel’s God turns from a trophy into a nightmare.

Theologically, this verse is the **turning point** of the psalm. It hints that the “no one does good” of verses 1–3 is not the *last word*: there *is* a “דור צדיק,” and God is there. That’s what makes the final prayer for Zion in verse 7 plausible instead of wishful thinking.

---

#### Verse 6

עֲצַת־עָנִי תָבִישׁוּ;  
כִּי יְהוָה מַחְסֵהוּ׃  

This verse is compact, but it’s the theological heart of the psalm. The structure is a classic **antithetic parallelism**: two lines that contrast:

- “עֲצַת־עָנִי תָבִישׁוּ” — “You shame / mock the counsel of the poor.”
- “כִּי יְהוָה מַחְסֵהוּ” — “For the LORD is his refuge.”

“עָנִי” is the poor, afflicted, humble person. In Psalms it often functions as a code‑name for the **faithful remnant** whose only security is God (see Ps 40:18, 86:1). His “עֵצָה” (“counsel, plan”) is his life strategy. And that plan is: “יְהוָה מַחְסֵהוּ” — “The LORD is his refuge.”

The wicked “תָבִישׁוּ” (put to shame, ridicule) that counsel: “Trust God? That’s your big plan? Good luck with that.” Radak paraphrases their taunt as the ancient version of “איה אלהיכם?” — “Where is your God?” (cf. Deut 32:37–38).

But the psalmist reverses the evaluation: that despised strategy is actually the only solid one. “מַחְסֶה” means “shelter, refuge,” used for rocks, caves, and God Himself:

- Ps 46:2: “אֱלֹהִים לָנוּ מַחֲסֶה וָעֹז” — “God is for us a refuge and strength.”
- Ps 91:2: “אֹמַר לַיהוָה: מַחְסִּי וּמְצוּדָתִי” — “I say to the LORD: my refuge and my fortress.”

So this line quietly defines what it means to be the “דור צדיק” (v. 5): the righteous/poor are those who consciously choose God as their only shelter, even when that looks foolish.

This verse also tightens the web of terms:

- עַמִּי (“my people,” v. 4) — the community being eaten.
- דּוֹר צַדִּיק (“circle of the righteous,” v. 5) — the same community, seen from God’s perspective.
- עָנִי (“poor,” v. 6) — the individual member of that community on the ground.

They’re three lenses on the same group: **God’s people / the righteous / the poor.** The wicked see “עָנִי”; God sees “צַדִּיק” and “עַמִּי.”

#### Verse 7

מִי־יִתֵּן מִצִּיּוֹן יְשׁוּעַת יִשְׂרָאֵל;  
בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה שְׁבוּת עַמּוֹ,  
יָגֵל יַעֲקֹב, יִשְׂמַח יִשְׂרָאֵל׃  

This final verse is a surprise twist. After all the grim analysis, we suddenly get a sighing wish: “מִי־יִתֵּן מִצִּיּוֹן יְשׁוּעַת יִשְׂרָאֵל” — “O that from Zion would come the salvation of Israel!”

“מִי־יִתֵּן” (“Who will give…?”) is a **wish‑formula**; we’d say “If only…!” in English. You saw it in Job 14:13 (“מִי יִתֵּן בִּשְׁאוֹל תַּצְפִּנֵנִי” — “O that You would hide me in Sheol”) and Deut 5:26 (“מִי־יִתֵּן וְהָיָה לְבָבָם זֶה לָהֶם” — “If only their heart would remain this way…”).

The wish is specifically for **salvation “from Zion”**. Zion = Jerusalem, especially the Temple mount, the symbolic place where God’s presence dwells. To wish for “ישועת ישראל” *from Zion* is to say: we don’t just want military success; we want a salvation that flows from God’s own dwelling and vindicates His people as *His*.

The second half fleshes this out:

> “בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה שְׁבוּת עַמּוֹ”  
> “When the LORD restores the fortunes of His people…”

As noted above, “שְׁבוּת” (from either שׁוב or שׁבה) is an idiom meaning “fortunes” or “state.” The Bible uses “לְשׁוּב שְׁבוּת” repeatedly for a big turn‑around:

- Jer 29:14: “וְשַׁבְתִּי אֶת־שְׁבוּתְכֶם” — “I will restore your fortunes.”
- Ps 126:1: “בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה אֶת־שִׁיבַת צִיּוֹן הָיִינוּ כְּחֹלְמִים” — “When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like dreamers.”

Our verse is structurally very close to Ps 126: both imagine a future “when the LORD restores” that will feel too good to be true. The ending:

> “יָגֵל יַעֲקֹב, יִשְׂמַח יִשְׂרָאֵל”

Pairs the two names of the patriarch (Jacob/Israel) for poetic warmth and fullness: the whole people, under both their names, will rejoice.

One more layer: in Psalm 53:7, the same verse reads:

> “מִי־יִתֵּן מִצִּיּוֹן יְשֻׁעוֹת יִשְׂרָאֵל; בְּשׁוּב אֱלֹהִים שְׁבוּת עַמּוֹ…”

There it’s “אֱלֹהִים” instead of “יְהוָה,” and “ישֻׁעוֹת” (plural “deliverances”). In our psalm, the use of יְהוָה and the Zion language anchor the hope more explicitly in the **national covenant story**—the God of Zion restoring His special people.

So the psalm, which began with “אֵין אֱלֹהִים” (“no God”) ends with “בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה שְׁבוּת עַמּוֹ” (“when the LORD restores the fortunes of His people”). The fool’s heart said, “No God, no judge.” The psalmist’s heart ends by betting everything on the opposite: there *is* a God, He *does* identify with “my people” and the “poor,” and from Zion He will eventually write a very different story.
