Psalm 14 is a small, sharp-edged poem whose opening line has had a long and noisy afterlife:  

> אָמַר נָבָל בְּלִבּוֹ  
> אֵין אֱלֹהִים.  
> “The benighted one has said in his heart,  
> ‘There is no God.’” (v. 1)

In modern ears this sounds like philosophical atheism. In biblical usage it is something narrower and, in a way, more unnerving: not denial of God’s existence but denial of God’s *relevance*. The *nāvāl*—literally the “churl,” the ignoble man—is the person who lives as though God neither governs nor judges.

Elsewhere, Deuteronomy rebukes Israel as “עַם נָבָל וְלֹא חָכָם” — “a foolish and unwise people” (Deut. 32:6), not because they are stupid but because they spurn the God who made and sustained them. Isaiah likewise contrasts the *nāvāl* with the noble: “לֹא יִקָּרֵא עוֹד לְנָבָל נָדִיב” — “The fool will no longer be called noble” (Isa. 32:5), and then defines him as one who “speaks folly” and “practices ungodliness” (32:6). In that register, the fool of Psalm 14 is not a village skeptic; he is the arrogant oppressor who imagines that “no one is watching.”

Rabbinic interpretation makes this explicit. The Torah Temimah, drawing on Berakhot 12b, notes that when the Shema warns, “וְלֹא תָתוּרוּ אַחֲרֵי לְבַבְכֶם” — “do not stray after your hearts” (Num. 15:39), the Sages gloss “after your hearts” as heresy, citing our verse: “אָמַר נָבָל בְּלִבּוֹ, אֵין אֱלֹהִים.” To follow one’s “heart,” in this sense, is to cultivate an interior monologue in which God is functionally absent.

From that interior sentence the psalmist widens the frame. The singular fool of v. 1 immediately becomes an unnamed “they”:

> הִשְׁחִיתוּ, הִתְעִיבוּ עֲלִילָה;  
> אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב. (v. 1b)  
>  
> “They have done ruin; they have made their deeds abominable;  
> there is none who does good.”

The verbs are heavy. *Hishḥîtū* (הִשְׁחִיתוּ) is the same root used of the pre-flood world, “וַתִּשָּׁחֵת הָאָרֶץ… כִּי הִשְׁחִית כָּל־בָּשָׂר” — “The earth was ruined… for all flesh had corrupted its way” (Gen. 6:11–12). *Hit’îvū* (הִתְעִיבוּ) is a verb of ritual and moral disgust: what is *to’evah*, abhorrent. BDB glosses this combination in our psalm as “make abominable, do abominably.”

Verse 2 then executes a cinematic cut. We move from the fool’s heart to a God’s‑eye view:

> יְהוָה מִשָּׁמַיִם הִשְׁקִיף עַל־בְּנֵי אָדָם;  
> לִרְאוֹת הֲיֵשׁ מַשְׂכִּיל, דֹּרֵשׁ אֶת־אֱלֹהִים.  

“YHWH looks down from heaven on human beings,  
to see whether there is one who acts wisely,  
one who seeks God.”

The verb הִשְׁקִיף (*hišqîf*) describes leaning out and looking down from a height, used when God “comes down” to inspect Babel (Gen. 11:5) or Sodom (Gen. 18:21). It is anthropomorphic, but its function is juridical: the deity investigates before judging. Here God is searching for a *maskîl* (מַשְׂכִּיל)—not a prodigy but someone who “has sense,” who lets understanding guide action—and, more precisely, one who “seeks God” (דֹּרֵשׁ אֶת־אֱלֹהִים).

The answer is devastating:

> הַכֹּל סָר, יַחְדָּו נֶאֱלָחוּ;  
> אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב, אֵין גַּם־אֶחָד. (v. 3)  

“All have turned aside; together they have become foul.  
There is none who does good, not even one.”

*Hakkol sār* — “the whole lot has swerved.” The rare verb *ne’elāḥu* (נֶאֱלָחוּ) probably carries the sense of milk that has gone sour; Job pairs its adjective with “abhorred” in describing corrupt humanity: “אַף כִּי־תֹעֵב וְנֶאֱלָח אִישׁ שֹׁתֶה כַמַּיִם עַוְלָה” — “How much more is a man abhorred and corrupt, who drinks iniquity like water!” (Job 15:16). The initial verdict “אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב” is repeated and intensified: “אֵין גַּם־אֶחָד — not even one.” The opening section is framed (an *inclusio*) by this absolute: “there is none who does good.”

Christian readers know these lines mainly through Paul’s catena in Romans 3, which quotes the Greek Psalm in its expanded form. The Septuagint of Psalm 14 (numbered 13 in Greek) imports additional phrases about open graves, venomous tongues, and feet swift to shed blood—phrases taken from other biblical texts. That expansion, already present in the LXX, let Paul string together a portrait of sin as a universal epidemic. The Hebrew psalm is terser, and sharper. It does not anatomize sin; it sketches its atmosphere.

Then, without warning, the canvas contracts from “all humanity” to a particular conflict:

> הֲלֹא יָדְעוּ כָּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן,  
> אֹכְלֵי עַמִּי אָכְלוּ לֶחֶם;  
> יְהוָה לֹא קָרָאוּ. (v. 4)  

“Do they not know, all the workers of mischief,  
who devour my people as they eat bread,  
who do not call upon YHWH?”

The metaphor tightens. The wicked are “*oḵlê ‘ammî*” (אֹכְלֵי עַמִּי), “those who eat my people.” Elsewhere, to “eat” someone is idiomatic for exploitation or conquest. Deuteronomy tells Israel, “וְאָכַלְתָּ אֶת־כָּל־הָעַמִּים” — “you shall consume all the peoples” (Deut. 7:16), and Micah gives a gruesome political cartoon of Judah’s leaders:

> אֲשֶׁר אָכְלוּ בְשַׂר עַמִּי,  
> וְעוֹרָם מֵעֲלֵיהֶם הִפְשִׁיטוּ… (Mic. 3:3)  

“Who eat the flesh of my people,  
and strip their skin from them…”

Our psalm does not linger on the gore, but the logic is the same: the powerful treat the weak as consumables.

Who speaks of “my people”? Medieval Jewish commentators answer in different registers. Rashi and the Meiri, reading the psalm as prophecy of Nebuchadnezzar or Titus, effectively hear God’s voice: “my people” are Israel under pagan boots. Radak and Metzudat David take a more generic view but still imagine the covenant community as the victim and the foreign empire as the devourer. Either way, the point is less ethnographic than theological: those who prey on “my people” also “do not call on YHWH.” They do not recognize a higher judge.

Verses 5–6 introduce a counter‑community:

> שָׁם פָּחֲדוּ פָחַד,  
> כִּי־אֱלֹהִים בְּדוֹר צַדִּיק.  
> עֲצַת עָנִי תָבִישׁוּ,  
> כִּי יְהוָה מַחְסֵהוּ.  

“There they were seized with terror,  
for God is with the generation of the righteous.  
The counsel of the poor you would shame,  
but YHWH is his refuge.”

The line “שָׁם פָּחֲדוּ פָחַד” has a palpable thump when read aloud; the doubled *pachad* (פָּחַד, “fear”) and the stresses — `**SHĀM** **PĀ**‑ḥa-dhū **FĀ**‑ḥadh` — mimic a heartbeat gone ragged. The precise “there” (*shām*) is unspecified, perhaps deliberately: wherever the wicked imagined themselves secure will turn out to be the place of panic once they discover that “God is in the generation of the righteous.”

Opposed to the eating oppressors are the *‘ānî* (עָנִי), the poor or afflicted, whose “counsel”—their decision to trust YHWH—is treated as laughable. Yet the psalm insists that “YHWH is his *maḥseh* (מַחְסֶה),” his shelter. This is a standard metaphor in the Psalms. “אֱלֹהִים לָנוּ מַחֲסֶה וָעֹז,” “God is for us a refuge and strength” (Ps. 46:2), and “יֹאמַר לַיהוָה מַחְסִּי וּמְצוּדָתִי,” “He says of YHWH, ‘My refuge and my fortress’” (Ps. 91:2). Here, too, the imagery is of physical cover against weather or assault, repurposed for divine protection.

The closing verse changes the poem’s temperature:

> מִי־יִתֵּן מִצִּיּוֹן יְשׁוּעַת יִשְׂרָאֵל;  
> בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה שְׁבוּת עַמּוֹ,  
> יָגֵל יַעֲקֹב, יִשְׂמַח יִשְׂרָאֵל. (v. 7)  

“O that deliverance for Israel might come from Zion!  
When YHWH restores the fortunes of his people,  
Jacob will exult, Israel will rejoice.”

The phrase “מִי־יִתֵּן” (*mi‑yitten*) literally means “who will give,” but in biblical idiom it is a wish formula: “If only…” (cf. Num. 11:29, “וּמִי־יִתֵּן כָּל־עַם יְהוָה נְבִיאִים” — “Would that all YHWH’s people were prophets!”). The universal lament collapses into a particular longing: salvation (*yeshu‘ah*) for Israel from Zion, the cultic and political center where God’s presence dwells. The technical phrase “שׁוּב… שְׁבוּת” (“restore the fortunes” or “bring back the captives”) recurs in exilic and post‑exilic texts: “וְשָׁב יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ אֶת־שְׁבוּתְךָ” — “YHWH your God will restore your fortunes” (Deut. 30:3); “וְשַׁבְתִּי אֶת־שְׁבוּת עַמִּי יִשְׂרָאֵל” — “I will restore the fortunes of my people Israel” (Amos 9:14). Our psalm locates its bleak anthropology, then, in a very specific historical hope: that a crushed community will be brought home and will laugh again.

Psalm 14 has a nearly verbatim twin, Psalm 53. The wording is virtually identical; the main differences are that Psalm 14 uses the personal name YHWH four times, while Psalm 53 consistently says “Elohim,” and that the final line there asks for “ישׁוּעוֹת יִשְׂרָאֵל” (“salvations,” plural, Ps. 53:7). Many scholars think Psalm 53 is a deliberate adaptation of our psalm for a different liturgical or historical setting—perhaps one less tightly bound to Zion. Medieval commentators like the Malbim already sensed this: he suggests Psalm 14 was composed for a particular deliverance in David’s life and later re‑used, with Elohistic tweaks, for the national miracle against Sennacherib.

However we date it, Psalm 14 holds together three perspectives that rarely coexist so compactly: a merciless pessimism about human justice, a fierce conviction that God sides with the poor, and a stubborn hope that this alignment will one day be visible “from Zion.” It begins in the fool’s heart and ends in the restored city.

  
## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

#### Full psalm

In the standard Ashkenazic and Sephardic rites Psalm 14 is not assigned a prominent, fixed place as a unit—unlike, say, Psalm 27 in Elul or Psalm 92 on Shabbat. It is occasionally recited in full as part of private supplication or the complete recitation of *Tehillim*, especially in times of communal distress, but this is a matter of custom rather than formal liturgy. Its influence in prayer comes more through its vocabulary and themes than through a set slot in the service.

#### Phrases

One of Psalm 14’s key phrases, “פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן” — “workers of iniquity” (v. 4), echoes strongly in Psalm 92, which *is* central to Shabbat liturgy. Psalm 92, recited as *Shir shel Yom* for Shabbat and often in *Pesukei de‑Zimra*, contrasts the short-lived flourishing of the wicked with divine justice:

> בִּפְרֹחַ רְשָׁעִים כְּמוֹ עֵשֶׂב,  
> וַיָּצִיצוּ כָּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן;  
> לְהִשָּׁמְדָם עֲדֵי־עַד. (Ps. 92:8)  
>  
> “When the wicked sprout like grass,  
> and all workers of iniquity blossom,  
> it is only that they may be destroyed forever.”

The Shabbat congregation thus weekly rehearses the conviction that the apparent success of “all workers of iniquity” is temporary. This is the same class of characters denounced in Psalm 14:4, “כָּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן, אֹכְלֵי עַמִּי” — “all workers of mischief, those who devour my people.” The liturgical reuse of the phrase places Psalm 14’s complaint into a broader rhythm of trust: whatever the present appetite of the devourers, “לְהִשָּׁמְדָם עֲדֵי־עַד” — “it is for their annihilation forever.”

A second thematic echo concerns the idiom “restore the fortunes” in v. 7: “בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה שְׁבוּת עַמּוֹ” — “when YHWH restores the fortunes of his people.” While Psalm 14 itself is not quoted, the noun שְׁבוּת (or שְׁבִית) and the verb שׁוּב underlie later biblical and liturgical language. Psalm 126, often sung before *Birkat ha‑Mazon* on Shabbat and festivals, begins:

> בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה אֶת שִׁיבַת צִיּוֹן,  
> הָיִינוּ כְּחֹלְמִים. (Ps. 126:1)  

“When YHWH restored the fortunes of Zion,  
we were like dreamers.”

The weekday *Amidah* also takes up the same hope in prose: “תְּקַע בְּשׁוֹפָר גָּדוֹל לְחֵרוּתֵנוּ… וְקַבְּצֵנוּ יַחַד מֵאַרְבַּע כַּנְפוֹת הָאָרֶץ” — “Sound the great shofar for our freedom… and gather us together from the four corners of the earth.” When we pray for the ingathering of exiles and the rebuilding of Jerusalem, we are effectively praying for what Psalm 14:7 envisions: a future moment when “יָגֵל יַעֲקֹב, יִשְׂמַח יִשְׂרָאֵל” — “Jacob will exult, Israel will rejoice.”
