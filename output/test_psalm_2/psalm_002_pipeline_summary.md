## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (8)

1. How does the Hebrew concept of divine adoptive sonship (v. 7) specifically differ from the Ugaritic 'bn 'il' formula, and what theological boundaries does this distinction maintain?
2. What is the precise meaning and significance of 'nāsaḵtî' (I have installed) in v. 6, and how does this verb relate to anointing and coronation practices?
3. How does the imagery of Zion as 'har qodšî' (My holy mountain) connect to ancient Near Eastern traditions of sacred mountains as divine dwelling places?
4. What is the semantic range of 'našśəqû-var' in v. 12, and how do different translations ('kiss the son' vs. 'pay homage in good faith') affect interpretation?
5. How does the progression from 'laughter' (śāḥaq) to 'anger' ('ap) to 'rage' (ḥārôn) in vv. 4-5 reflect Hebrew concepts of divine emotional responses?
6. What is the significance of the iron mace (šēbeṭ barzel) imagery in v. 9, and how does it relate to ancient military and royal symbolism?
7. How do the wisdom terminology and beatitude formula in vv. 10-12 connect this royal psalm to sapiential literature?
8. What role does the psalm's structure as 'ḥoq' (decree) play in legitimizing royal authority within Israel's covenantal theology?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (8)

1. Why use the rare verb רגשׁ (tumultuous assembly) instead of common gathering terms in v.1?
2. What is the precise meaning of נסכתי (installed) in v.6 - libation ceremony or royal appointment?
3. How does the temporal reference היום (this day) in v.7 function - coronation moment or eternal decree?
4. Why shift to wisdom genre vocabulary (השׂכילו/הוסרו) at the psalm's climax in v.10?
5. What is the correct interpretation of the textual crux נשׁקו־בר in v.12?
6. How does divine laughter (v.4) function theologically - amusement, derision, or something else?
7. What does the paradoxical phrase 'rejoice with trembling' (v.11) reveal about proper divine-human relationship?
8. Why does God use psychological terror (יבהלם) rather than physical destruction in v.5?
