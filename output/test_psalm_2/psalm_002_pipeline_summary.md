## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (8)

1. How does the Hebrew concept of divine adoptive sonship (v. 7) specifically differ from the Ugaritic 'bn 'il' formula, and what theological boundaries does this distinction maintain?
2. What is the precise meaning and significance of 'nāsaḵtî' (I have installed) in v. 6, and how does this verb relate to anointing and coronation practices?
3. How does the imagery of Zion as 'har qodšî' (My holy mountain) connect to ancient Near Eastern traditions of sacred mountains as divine dwelling places?
4. What is the semantic range of 'našśəqû-var' in v. 12, and how do different translations ('kiss the son' vs. 'pay homage in good faith') affect interpretation?
5. How does the progression from 'laughter' (śāḥaq) to 'anger' ('ap) to 'rage' (ḥārôn) in vv. 4-5 reflect Hebrew concepts of divine emotional responses?
6. What is the significance of the iron mace (šēbeṭ barzel) imagery in v. 9, and how does it relate to ancient military and royal symbolism?
7. How do the wisdom terminology and beatitude formula in vv. 10-12 connect this royal psalm to sapiential literature?
8. What role does the psalm's structure as 'ḥoq' (decree) play in legitimizing royal authority within Israel's covenantal theology?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (10)

1. Why does the psalm use the rare verb רגש in v.1 instead of more common assembly vocabulary?
2. What is the significance of the double restraint imagery (מוסרות and עבתים) in v.3 - are these different types of divine authority?
3. How does the unusual verb נסכתי (I have installed) in v.6 relate to anointing and coronation practices?
4. Why does divine laughter (v.4) escalate to anger (v.5) - what triggers this emotional progression?
5. What does the 'today' in v.7 refer to - eternal decree, coronation day, or something else?
6. How can the tender father-son relationship (vv.7-8) coexist with violent conquest imagery (v.9)?
7. What accounts for the genre shift from royal psalm to wisdom instruction in vv.10-12?
8. What does נשקו־בר actually mean in v.12, and why is this verse so grammatically problematic?
9. Why does the psalm end with the paradox of fearful service and trembling joy in v.11?
10. How do the LXX interpretive choices (especially in vv.9,12) reflect early theological concerns about the text?
