## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (8)

1. How does the Hebrew concept of divine adoptive sonship (v. 7) specifically differ from the Ugaritic 'bn 'il' formula, and what theological boundaries does this distinction maintain?
2. What is the precise meaning and significance of 'nāsaḵtî' (I have installed) in v. 6, and how does this verb relate to anointing and coronation practices?
3. How does the imagery of Zion as 'har qodšî' (My holy mountain) connect to ancient Near Eastern traditions of sacred mountains as divine dwelling places?
4. What is the semantic range of 'našśəqû-var' in v. 12, and how do different translations ('kiss the son' vs. 'pay homage in good faith') affect interpretation?
5. How does the progression from 'laughter' (śāḥaq) to 'anger' ('ap) to 'rage' (ḥārôn) in vv. 4-5 reflect Hebrew concepts of divine emotional responses?
6. What is the significance of the iron mace (šēbeṭ barzel) imagery in v. 9, and how does it relate to ancient military and royal symbolism?
7. How do the wisdom terminology and beatitude formula in vv. 10-12 connect this royal psalm to sapiential literature?
8. What role does the psalm's structure as 'ḥoq' (decree) play in legitimizing royal authority within Israel's covenantal theology?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (10)

1. Why does the psalm open with rhetorical questions (למה) rather than declarative statements about divine sovereignty?
2. What is the significance of the rare verb רגשו (ragashu) for nations 'raging' - does it imply animalistic or merely agitated behavior?
3. How does the divine laughter (ישחק) function theologically - is it dismissive mockery or ominous amusement before judgment?
4. What exactly does נסכתי (nasakti) mean in v6 - libation pouring, installation, or anointing, and why this particular term?
5. Why does v9 paradoxically combine shepherding (תרעם) with violent destruction - is this ironic or indicative of royal care?
6. What accounts for the dramatic genre shift from royal psalm to wisdom discourse in vv10-12?
7. How should נשקו־בר be understood - 'kiss the son' implying the Davidic king, or 'pay homage sincerely' as a general call to submission?
8. Why conclude with a beatitude formula (אשרי) when the dominant tone has been threatening throughout?
9. How does the psalm's spatial progression (earth→heaven→Zion→earth) create theological meaning beyond mere literary structure?
10. What is the relationship between the divine decree (חק) in v7 and the wisdom instruction beginning in v10?
