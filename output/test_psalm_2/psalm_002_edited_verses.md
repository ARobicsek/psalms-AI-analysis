Verse 1
“Why do nations `rāgaš`—throng in tumult—and peoples `yehĕgū` emptiness?” The verb `rāgaš` is a rare choice: as a verb only here, elsewhere as a noun for a “throng” (Psalm 55:15). It points to noisy agitation rather than deliberation. More telling is `yehĕgū` (from `hāgāh`), a term that in Psalm 1 describes murmuring Torah. The poet twists it: what the blessed man murmurs (Torah), the nations mutter in vain. This is Hebrew parallelism at work—the second colon completing the first with a sharp ironic edge. The “nations/peoples” pairing is a merism (naming parts to imply the whole), so the stage is global. “Emptiness” (`rîq`) is a verdict word; it is used elsewhere for futile plans (Isaiah 30:7). The framing with Psalm 1 is crucial: Psalm 1’s closing “the way of the wicked will perish” becomes, in Psalm 2, the international way of revolt that collapses under its own weight. By beginning with a question and ending with “emptiness,” the verse announces both the drama and the outcome. 

Verse 2
“Kings of earth take their stand; rulers `nōsĕdû-yāḥad`—sit in conclave together—against the LORD and against His anointed.” The verb `yithyatsṣū` (“take their stand”) is military: to set one’s lines (cf. 1 Samuel 17:16). `Nōsĕdû` comes from `yāsad` (“found, fix”), and BDB notes the sense “sit close together,” a council that congeals into conspiracy. The phrase “against the LORD and against His anointed” binds theology to politics: to resist the Davidic king is to resist God’s appointment. `Māšîaḥ` means “anointed one,” referring to the reigning monarch, not yet a messianic abstraction. The parallelism moves from scene (“take their stand”) to plot (“against... against”), intensifying the defiance. The little adverb “together” (`yāḥad`) matters: it converts scattered discontent into coordinated rebellion—a pattern in the Bible’s narratives of hubris (cf. Genesis 11). 

Verse 3
“Let us tear off their bonds (`mōsĕrōtēhem`) and throw from us their cords (`’ăvōtēhem`).” The rebels’ voice arrives without introduction—dramatic, immediate. Both nouns belong to the world of harness and bondage. Elsewhere “bonds” name servitude that Israel longs to break (Jeremiah 2:20), but God also “loosens the bonds” of the oppressed (Psalm 107:14). `’Ăvōt` (“cords”) drags a tender counter-image in Hosea 11:4: “cords of love.” Psalm 2 leverages the ambiguity: the same vocabulary can figure tyranny or covenant. The two cohortatives (“let us break... let us cast away”) carry determination. The line’s parallelism is classic “A is so, and what’s more, B”: from breaking to throwing, from bonds to cords. In the larger arc, the irony will invert the metaphor: those who scorn the gentle yoke (Hosea) will meet the iron rod (v. 9). 

Verse 4
“He who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord mocks them.” The participle “sits” suggests enduring enthronement, not a momentary appearance. Divine laughter in the Hebrew Bible is unusual and pointed. Proverbs 1:26 has Wisdom laughing at the ruin of mockers; the laughter registers not lightheartedness but the collapse of pretension. The doubling—laughs/mocks—intensifies the derision. The spatial jump matters: the perspective vaults from ground-level tumult to the stillness of the heavenly court. The sound texture (sibilants in Hebrew) reinforces the cool disdain. Theologically, the laugh is a mercy; the voice that terrifies comes only “then” (v. 5). 

Verse 5
“Then He speaks to them in His anger, and in His wrath He terrifies them.” The adverb “then” marks escalation. The verbs move from laughter to speech to terror. The verb “terrify” (`yĕbahălēhm`) comes from a root (`bhl`) for panic and sudden dismay (cf. Deuteronomy 28:20). The judgment here is first psychological; the mind unravels before any blow is struck. Parallelism stacks cause and effect: speech in anger produces terror in wrath. Traditional commentators sensed the sequence: when mockery fails to correct, discipline intensifies.

Verse 6
“But as for Me, I have `nasakhti` my king on Zion, my holy mountain.” The opening pronoun (“But I…”) is a thunderclap of contrast. `Nasakhti` is a richly ambidextrous verb: in Hebrew, “to pour out” (for libations), and—by an Akkadian parallel—“to install.” Both suit a coronation liturgy. The psalm compresses rite and rule into one verb: the king is consecrated and enthroned. “Zion, my holy mountain” fuses geography and theology. In Israel’s poetry Zion becomes the chosen place of divine presence (Psalm 3:5), set polemically against cosmological peaks like “Zaphon” (Psalm 48:3). The verse’s pronouns (“my king… my holy mountain”) assert ownership against the rebels’ “let us.”

Verse 7
“Let me recount the decree: The LORD said to me, ‘You are my son; I today have begotten you.’” `Ḥōq` (“decree/statute”) is legal diction—this is the fixed enthronement oracle, not political propaganda. “You are my son” is adoptive royal language. In the ancient Near East, kings might claim divine parentage; Israel reshapes the trope within monotheism as adoptive commission. The “begetting” is not biology but office; “today” most naturally points to the coronation day. Rashi grounds it in prophetic confirmation; Radak presses the theological point: “The kingdom has come to me from Him.” The psalm’s conceptual move is subtle: the king is exalted without being deified, and his authority is derivative—given, not innate. 

Verse 8
“Ask of Me, and I will give nations as your heritage, the ends of the earth as your possession.” The imperative “ask” (`she’al`) invites the king into an ongoing petitionary relationship, like God’s invitation to Solomon (1 Kings 3:5). The nouns `naḥălāh` (heritage) and `’ăḥuzzāh` (possession/estate) belong to the grammar of legitimate holding—inheritance, title, tenure. Dominion here is framed not as marauding but as a gift conferred. The merism “ends of the earth” is standard biblical shorthand for comprehensiveness (cf. Psalm 72:8). The staging expands from Zion’s hill to the horizon.

Verse 9
“You shall `tĕrō‘ēm` with an iron rod; like a potter’s vessel you shall shatter them.” Two interpretive tracks meet here. The MT reads the verb from `rā‘a‘` (“to break”), yielding a violent image, confirmed by the second colon’s `tĕnappṣēm` (“shatter”). The LXX reads “shepherd” (`poimaineis`)—hearing a different homograph (`rā‘āh`, “to shepherd”). Each has biblical credentials. The “potter’s vessel” simile (Jeremiah 19:1–11) underscores fragility; a clay jar’s ruin is quick and irreparable. Iron, by contrast, signals unbending strength (Deuteronomy 28:48’s “iron yoke”). If the MT is right, verse 9 is a stark judgment oracle. If the LXX, it is severe pastoral authority—still iron, but rule rather than ruin. The figurative database shows pottery imagery recurs to mark vulnerability; Psalm 2 applies it to nations who imagined themselves granite. The juxtaposition—iron against clay—smashes the rebellion’s self-estimate.

Verse 10
“And now, O kings, be wise; be warned, O judges of earth.” The genre shifts openly to wisdom. `Haśkîlû` is practical intelligence, the capacity to act judiciously; `hiwāsrū` is “accept discipline/receive correction.” The address pivots from denunciation to pedagogy: the psalm still presumes teachability. The line also makes a neat micro-chiasm (kings//judges; be wise//be warned), binding authority to accountability. This sapiential turn reframes the “iron rod” not as brute force but as the backdrop for moral instruction. The kings who “took their stand” (v. 2) are now invited to stand corrected.

Verse 11
“Serve the LORD with fear; rejoice with trembling.” `‘Avdū` means both worship and political service—recognize the rightful sovereign. `Yir’ah` (“fear”) in biblical wisdom is not cringing dread but reverent recognition of God’s reality. The paradox—joy with trembling—captures biblical piety’s double vision: God is the source of delight and the one before whom we tremble. Rashi resolves it temporally—when the trembling comes, you will rejoice if you have served. Meiri hears it devotionally: be glad precisely in what makes you tremble, because it is God’s will. The collocation is rare, which makes it memorable; it resists flattening piety into either sentimentality or terror. 

Verse 12
“`Naššəqû-bar` lest he be angry and you perish from the way, for his anger quickly flares; happy are all who take refuge in Him.” `Naššəqû` (“kiss”) is the ancient gesture of homage—hands or feet kissed to mark subjection (cf. 1 Samuel 10:1; 1 Kings 19:18’s “every mouth that has not kissed Baal”). `Bar` admits three live readings:
- Aramaic “son” (as in Proverbs 31:2): “Kiss the son,” aligning with verse 7 and forming symmetry with “against the LORD and His anointed” (v. 2). Radak and Ibn Ezra incline this way.
- Hebrew “purity/clean”: “Kiss in purity,” i.e., offer sincere homage, not lip service (cf. Psalm 24:4, “pure heart”).
- Following the LXX (“take hold of instruction”) and Vulgate (“apprehendite disciplinam”): “embrace discipline,” which perfectly fits the wisdom exhortations of vv. 10–11.
The warning—“lest he be angry… and you perish from the way”—returns to Psalm 1’s “way” motif; there are only two paths, and rebellion is a way that erases itself. “His anger kindles but a little” can mean either “in but a moment” (temporal) or “though only a little of it will do” (degree)—in either case, the window for wisdom is not infinite. The psalm ends, however, not with a fist but with an invitation: “Happy (`’ashrei`) are all who take refuge in Him.” The beatitude recalls Psalm 1’s opening and throws the door wide. The royal psalm closes as a wisdom psalm: shelter is available, not only to kings, but to “all.”
