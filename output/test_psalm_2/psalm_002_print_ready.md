# Commentary on Psalm 2
---
## Introduction
Psalm 2 opens with a question that is more diagnosis than inquiry: “Why are nations in tumult, and why do peoples mutter emptiness?” The final word, “emptiness,” deflates the spectacle; the poet has already reached the verdict. The verb for “mutter/plot,” `hāgāh`, is a hinge between Psalm 1 and Psalm 2. The righteous person “mutters” Torah day and night (Psalm 1:2), while the nations “mutter” empty things (Psalm 2:1). In Hebrew poetry a colon is a single poetic line in a parallel pair, and parallelism is the art of pairing lines so the second confirms, sharpens, or intensifies the first. The echo across psalms is deliberate. Psalm 1 ends by contrasting “the way of the wicked” that “perishes” with God’s protection of the righteous path; Psalm 2 shows the world-scale version of that same divergence. And as Psalm 1 begins with “Happy/‘Ashrei is the man,” Psalm 2 ends with “Happy/‘Ashrei are all who take refuge in Him.” Together they frame an entrance to the Psalter: from personal piety to public power, from Torah-meditation to geopolitics—two doors that open into one house.
The poem is staged as theater. We begin with a narrator’s incredulity (vv. 1–2), then hear the rebels’ own manifesto (v. 3), shift suddenly to heaven for divine laughter and speech (vv. 4–6), hear the king recite his coronation decree (vv. 7–9), and end with a wisdom teacher addressing those same kings (vv. 10–12). The genre is a “royal psalm,” likely used in coronation or reaffirmation rites of the Davidic king. But its scope is larger than any one enthronement: Zion’s hill becomes the axis where divine authority and human rule meet.
Verse 3 offers the rebels’ image: cords and ropes to be torn off—`mōsĕrôt` and `’ăvōt`. These are the ties of harness, the language of yoke and bond. In the Bible such ropes can represent oppression (Jeremiah 2:20: “You broke your yoke, you burst your bonds”), but they also—strikingly—can represent care (Hosea 11:4: “with cords of love I drew them”). Psalm 2 presses the ambiguity: what the rebels call bondage is the woven order of the world; to cast it off is not liberation but a lurch into futility.
The pivot comes with laughter. “He who sits in the heavens laughs” (v. 4). Divine laughter is rare in Scripture and usually signals the collapse of human pretension (Proverbs 1:26: Wisdom “laughs” at the calamity of the mocker). It is not frivolity but a theological statement: the mismatch between cosmic sovereignty and provincial conspiracy is laughable. Laughter gives way to anger and then to the terror of a voice (v. 5), a psychological undoing rather than immediate destruction. The root for “terrify,” `bhl`, often names panic and sudden alarm; judgment begins in the mind.
God’s reply is a single line with a long shadow: “I myself have installed my king on Zion, my holy mountain” (v. 6). The verb `nasakhti` straddles ritual and rule. In Hebrew it can mean “to pour out” (a libation) and—likely by way of an Akkadian cognate—to “install.” Both senses fit a coronation. Zion is not a generic hill, but the chosen site of God’s presence. Elsewhere Scripture ranges this mountain against the divine peaks of the ancient world: “Mount Zion, summit of Zaphon” (Psalm 48:3), a way of saying that the place of Israel’s God stands where other peoples imagine the gods to dwell. Zion functions as metonym for God’s rule (Psalm 3:5: “He answers me from His holy mountain”).
Then the king speaks. “I will recount the decree (`ḥōq`): The LORD said to me, ‘You are my son; today I have begotten you’” (v. 7). `Ḥōq` is legal language—the fixed statute of the enthronement oracle, not a passing mood. The phrase “You are my son” draws on a Near Eastern vocabulary of royal adoption. Unlike claims of literal divine birth in some cultures, Israel’s theology keeps a strict boundary: sonship is covenantal, not biological. The king becomes “son” by God’s sovereign choice and charge. The time word “today” most naturally points to the coronation day—this day the king is adopted to serve as God’s earthly representative—though the formula proved elastic enough to bear later messianic readings.
“Ask of Me,” continues the voice, “and I will make the nations your heritage, the ends of the earth your possession” (v. 8). The verbs and nouns here belong to the law of land and inheritance: `naḥălāh` (heritage) and `’ăḥuzzāh` (estate). Both speak to legitimacy, not plunder. But what that rule entails is contested in verse 9, where the Masoretic Text (MT, the authoritative medieval Hebrew tradition) reads: “You shall break them with an iron rod, shatter them like a potter’s vessel.” The Septuagint (LXX, the ancient Greek translation), however, reads: “You shall shepherd them with an iron rod.” The difference turns on a single Hebrew form (`tĕrō‘ēm`), which in the MT is read from a root meaning “break/shatter” (`rā‘a‘`), while the LXX heard the homograph of “shepherd” (`rā‘āh`). Both images are potent. The MT stresses the fragility of opposition (Jeremiah 19:1–11 shatters a jar to symbolize judgment). The LXX reframes royal power as severe pastoral authority: not sentimental, but guiding—unbending in material (iron), yet fundamentally aimed at governance, not mere smashing. The psalm can bear the tension; both senses have shaped later readings.
The final movement—“And now, O kings, be wise; be warned, O judges of the earth” (v. 10)—slides into the diction of wisdom literature. `Haśkîlû` means “act with intelligence” (to be wise in the practical, behavioral sense). `Hiwāsrū` carries the weight of “accept discipline.” Instead of pure denunciation, the psalm offers pedagogy. Allegiance is taught, not only enforced. The paired imperatives that follow—“Serve the LORD with fear; rejoice with trembling” (v. 11)—capture the paradox of biblical piety: joy and awe are not opposites but companions. Rashi memorably glossed it: when trembling arrives, you will rejoice—if you have served.
The closing line is a crux. `Naššəqû-bar` has at least three live options. 1) “Kiss the son” (taking `bar` as Aramaic “son,” as in Proverbs 31:2), a gesture of political homage familiar in the ancient world (compare 1 Samuel 10:1; 1 Kings 19:18). This aligns with “against the LORD and against His anointed” (v. 2). 2) “Kiss in purity” (taking `bar` as Hebrew “pure”), that is, pay sincere homage. 3) The LXX and Vulgate read “take hold of instruction/discipline,” which fits the wisdom frame. Each option coheres with the psalm’s thrust: submission, sincerity, or teachability. The warning—“lest he be angry, and you perish from the way, for his anger kindles but a little”—is the world-scale version of Psalm 1’s two ways. And then, finally, the blessing: “Happy are all who take refuge in Him.” The psalm does not end with crushed nations but with wide-open shelter.
Technical note:
- Parallelism is the pairing of poetic lines (cola) so that the second intensifies or completes the first.
- Inclusio is a framing device that repeats at beginning and end; here, Psalm 1 opens and Psalm 2 closes with “’ashrei.”
- MT is the Masoretic Text, the medieval Hebrew textual tradition; LXX is the Septuagint, the ancient Greek translation; their differences sometimes reveal alternative ancient readings.
- BDB refers to Brown-Driver-Briggs, the standard Hebrew lexicon.

## Verse-by-Verse Commentary
Verse 1
“Why do nations `rāgaš`—throng in tumult—and peoples `yehĕgū` emptiness?” The verb `rāgaš` is a rare choice: as a verb only here, elsewhere as a noun for a “throng” (Psalm 55:15). It points to noisy agitation rather than deliberation. More telling is `yehĕgū` (from `hāgāh`), a term that in Psalm 1 describes murmuring Torah. The poet twists it: what the blessed man murmurs (Torah), the nations mutter in vain. This is Hebrew parallelism at work—the second colon completing the first with a sharp ironic edge. The “nations/peoples” pairing is a merism (naming parts to imply the whole), so the stage is global. “Emptiness” (`rîq`) is a verdict word; it is used elsewhere for futile plans (Isaiah 30:7). The framing with Psalm 1 is crucial: Psalm 1’s closing “the way of the wicked will perish” becomes, in Psalm 2, the international way of revolt that collapses under its own weight. By beginning with a question and ending with “emptiness,” the verse announces both the drama and the outcome. 
Verse 2
“Kings of earth take their stand; rulers `nōsĕdû-yāḥad`—sit in conclave together—against the LORD and against His anointed.” The verb `yithyatsṣū` (“take their stand”) is military: to set one’s lines (cf. 1 Samuel 17:16). `Nōsĕdû` comes from `yāsad` (“found, fix”), and BDB notes the sense “sit close together,” a council that congeals into conspiracy. The phrase “against the LORD and against His anointed” binds theology to politics: to resist the Davidic king is to resist God’s appointment. `Māšîaḥ` means “anointed one,” referring to the reigning monarch, not yet a messianic abstraction. The parallelism moves from scene (“take their stand”) to plot (“against... against”), intensifying the defiance. The little adverb “together” (`yāḥad`) matters: it converts scattered discontent into coordinated rebellion—a pattern in the Bible’s narratives of hubris (cf. Genesis 11). 
Verse 3
“Let us tear off their bonds (`mōsĕrōtēhem`) and throw from us their cords (`’ăvōtēhem`).” The rebels’ voice arrives without introduction—dramatic, immediate. Both nouns belong to the world of harness and bondage. Elsewhere “bonds” name servitude that Israel longs to break (Jeremiah 2:20), but God also “loosens the bonds” of the oppressed (Psalm 107:14). `’Ăvōt` (“cords”) drags a tender counter-image in Hosea 11:4: “cords of love.” Psalm 2 leverages the ambiguity: the same vocabulary can figure tyranny or covenant. The two cohortatives (“let us break... let us cast away”) carry determination. The line’s parallelism is classic “A is so, and what’s more, B”: from breaking to throwing, from bonds to cords. In the larger arc, the irony will invert the metaphor: those who scorn the gentle yoke (Hosea) will meet the iron rod (v. 9). 
Verse 4
“He who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord mocks them.” The participle “sits” suggests enduring enthronement, not a momentary appearance. Divine laughter in the Hebrew Bible is unusual and pointed. Proverbs 1:26 has Wisdom laughing at the ruin of mockers; the laughter registers not lightheartedness but the collapse of pretension. The doubling—laughs/mocks—intensifies the derision. The spatial jump matters: the perspective vaults from ground-level tumult to the stillness of the heavenly court. The sound texture (sibilants in Hebrew) reinforces the cool disdain. Theologically, the laugh is a mercy; the voice that terrifies comes only “then” (v. 5). 
Verse 5
“Then He speaks to them in His anger, and in His wrath He terrifies them.” The adverb “then” marks escalation. The verbs move from laughter to speech to terror. The verb “terrify” (`yĕbahălēhm`) comes from a root (`bhl`) for panic and sudden dismay (cf. Deuteronomy 28:20). The judgment here is first psychological; the mind unravels before any blow is struck. Parallelism stacks cause and effect: speech in anger produces terror in wrath. Traditional commentators sensed the sequence: when mockery fails to correct, discipline intensifies.
Verse 6
“But as for Me, I have `nasakhti` my king on Zion, my holy mountain.” The opening pronoun (“But I…”) is a thunderclap of contrast. `Nasakhti` is a richly ambidextrous verb: in Hebrew, “to pour out” (for libations), and—by an Akkadian parallel—“to install.” Both suit a coronation liturgy. The psalm compresses rite and rule into one verb: the king is consecrated and enthroned. “Zion, my holy mountain” fuses geography and theology. In Israel’s poetry Zion becomes the chosen place of divine presence (Psalm 3:5), set polemically against cosmological peaks like “Zaphon” (Psalm 48:3). The verse’s pronouns (“my king… my holy mountain”) assert ownership against the rebels’ “let us.”
Verse 7
“Let me recount the decree: The LORD said to me, ‘You are my son; I today have begotten you.’” `Ḥōq` (“decree/statute”) is legal diction—this is the fixed enthronement oracle, not political propaganda. “You are my son” is adoptive royal language. In the ancient Near East, kings might claim divine parentage; Israel reshapes the trope within monotheism as adoptive commission. The “begetting” is not biology but office; “today” most naturally points to the coronation day. Rashi grounds it in prophetic confirmation; Radak presses the theological point: “The kingdom has come to me from Him.” The psalm’s conceptual move is subtle: the king is exalted without being deified, and his authority is derivative—given, not innate. 
Verse 8
“Ask of Me, and I will give nations as your heritage, the ends of the earth as your possession.” The imperative “ask” (`she’al`) invites the king into an ongoing petitionary relationship, like God’s invitation to Solomon (1 Kings 3:5). The nouns `naḥălāh` (heritage) and `’ăḥuzzāh` (possession/estate) belong to the grammar of legitimate holding—inheritance, title, tenure. Dominion here is framed not as marauding but as a gift conferred. The merism “ends of the earth” is standard biblical shorthand for comprehensiveness (cf. Psalm 72:8). The staging expands from Zion’s hill to the horizon.
Verse 9
“You shall `tĕrō‘ēm` with an iron rod; like a potter’s vessel you shall shatter them.” Two interpretive tracks meet here. The MT reads the verb from `rā‘a‘` (“to break”), yielding a violent image, confirmed by the second colon’s `tĕnappṣēm` (“shatter”). The LXX reads “shepherd” (`poimaineis`)—hearing a different homograph (`rā‘āh`, “to shepherd”). Each has biblical credentials. The “potter’s vessel” simile (Jeremiah 19:1–11) underscores fragility; a clay jar’s ruin is quick and irreparable. Iron, by contrast, signals unbending strength (Deuteronomy 28:48’s “iron yoke”). If the MT is right, verse 9 is a stark judgment oracle. If the LXX, it is severe pastoral authority—still iron, but rule rather than ruin. The figurative database shows pottery imagery recurs to mark vulnerability; Psalm 2 applies it to nations who imagined themselves granite. The juxtaposition—iron against clay—smashes the rebellion’s self-estimate.
Verse 10
“And now, O kings, be wise; be warned, O judges of earth.” The genre shifts openly to wisdom. `Haśkîlû` is practical intelligence, the capacity to act judiciously; `hiwāsrū` is “accept discipline/receive correction.” The address pivots from denunciation to pedagogy: the psalm still presumes teachability. The line also makes a neat micro-chiasm (kings//judges; be wise//be warned), binding authority to accountability. This sapiential turn reframes the “iron rod” not as brute force but as the backdrop for moral instruction. The kings who “took their stand” (v. 2) are now invited to stand corrected.
Verse 11
“Serve the LORD with fear; rejoice with trembling.” `‘Avdū` means both worship and political service—recognize the rightful sovereign. `Yir’ah` (“fear”) in biblical wisdom is not cringing dread but reverent recognition of God’s reality. The paradox—joy with trembling—captures biblical piety’s double vision: God is the source of delight and the one before whom we tremble. Rashi resolves it temporally—when the trembling comes, you will rejoice if you have served. Meiri hears it devotionally: be glad precisely in what makes you tremble, because it is God’s will. The collocation is rare, which makes it memorable; it resists flattening piety into either sentimentality or terror. 
Verse 12
“`Naššəqû-bar` lest he be angry and you perish from the way, for his anger quickly flares; happy are all who take refuge in Him.” `Naššəqû` (“kiss”) is the ancient gesture of homage—hands or feet kissed to mark subjection (cf. 1 Samuel 10:1; 1 Kings 19:18’s “every mouth that has not kissed Baal”). `Bar` admits three live readings:
- Aramaic “son” (as in Proverbs 31:2): “Kiss the son,” aligning with verse 7 and forming symmetry with “against the LORD and His anointed” (v. 2). Radak and Ibn Ezra incline this way.
- Hebrew “purity/clean”: “Kiss in purity,” i.e., offer sincere homage, not lip service (cf. Psalm 24:4, “pure heart”).
- Following the LXX (“take hold of instruction”) and Vulgate (“apprehendite disciplinam”): “embrace discipline,” which perfectly fits the wisdom exhortations of vv. 10–11.
The warning—“lest he be angry… and you perish from the way”—returns to Psalm 1’s “way” motif; there are only two paths, and rebellion is a way that erases itself. “His anger kindles but a little” can mean either “in but a moment” (temporal) or “though only a little of it will do” (degree)—in either case, the window for wisdom is not infinite. The psalm ends, however, not with a fist but with an invitation: “Happy (`’ashrei`) are all who take refuge in Him.” The beatitude recalls Psalm 1’s opening and throws the door wide. The royal psalm closes as a wisdom psalm: shelter is available, not only to kings, but to “all.”
Definitions and notes used throughout:
