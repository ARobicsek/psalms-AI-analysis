# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 2

What works: The draft rightly treats Psalm 2 as a staged drama with shifting voices and a movement from local politics to universal rule. It integrates traditional Jewish commentators, notes the ritual-political range of `nasakhti` in verse 6, and recognizes the sapiential turn in verses 10–12. It is alert to the imagery of bonds and cords, divine laughter, and the iron rod/pottery contrast.

What needs revision: Several essential threads are missing or underdeveloped. Most notably, the intertext with Psalm 1 is central: the rare verb in Psalm 1 (“to murmur/meditate,” `hāgāh`) reappears in Psalm 2:1 (“peoples `yehgu` emptiness”), and the closing beatitude (`’ashrei`) mirrors Psalm 1’s opening, forming an inclusio at the gateway of the Psalter. The commentary mentions sound and “phonetic transcriptions” but leans on idiosyncratic forms; safer is to describe audible patterns without dubious phonetics. Verse 9’s crux is insufficiently treated: MT “break” (`tĕrō‘ēm` from `rā‘a‘`, shatter) versus the Septuagint (LXX, ancient Greek translation) “shepherd,” which significantly reframes royal power. Verse 12’s `naššəqû-bar` requires a fuller mapping of options (Aramaic “son,” Hebrew “purity,” LXX “take hold of discipline”), with their implications.

Missed opportunities from the research bundle:
- Psalm 2’s “holy mountain” (v. 6) should be set against the broader biblical mountain theology (Psalm 48’s Zion as “Zaphon”; Psalm 3:5, “from His holy mountain”).
- Figurative language parallels ought to be specific: bonds/yoke imagery (Jeremiah 2:20; Hosea 11:4; Deuteronomy 28:48), divine laughter (Proverbs 1:26), potter’s ware (Jeremiah 19:1–11).
- The legal language of `ḥōq` (v. 7) merits expansion.
- The verb `nōsədû` (v. 2) from `yāsad`—“sit in conclave”—adds texture beyond “conspire.”

Style: The tone is mostly measured, but there is occasional jargon drift. Define terms (LXX, MT, colon, parallelism, inclusio) and avoid speculative phonetics. 

Answerable questions to address now:
- Psalm 1–2 framing (“mutter”/“mutter,” `’ashrei` inclusio).
- `tĕrō‘ēm`: “break” (MT) vs “shepherd” (LXX).
- `naššəqû-bar`: plausible readings and cultural practice of homage-kissing (1 Samuel 10:1; 1 Kings 19:18).
- The point of the wisdom pivot (vv. 10–12) and its vocabulary (`haśkîl`, `hiwāsrū`).

Figurative language: Cite specific parallels, note frequency/patterns, and show how Psalm 2 uses them distinctively (e.g., transforming bonds-as-oppression into bonds-as-divine-order).
