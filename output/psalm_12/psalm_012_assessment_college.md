# Editorial Assessment (College Edition) - Psalm 12

The existing introduction and commentary have a lot going for them. They’re well‑informed, text‑centered, and notice many genuinely interesting things: the “heart and heart” idiom (בְּלֵב וָלֵב), the contrast between smooth human lips and refined divine words, the grammatical puzzle in v.8, and the unusual divine oracle in v.6. Traditional Jewish commentators are brought in intelligently, and the macro‑thesis—that Psalm 12 is about a breakdown of language—is strong.

For a first‑year college audience, though, there are several problems:

- **Density and jargon.** The prose leans toward dissertation‑speak. Terms like *jussive, synecdoche, ontological crisis, semantic range, chiastic, eschatological tension* appear with little or no explanation. A sharp student can handle these concepts, but they need quick, plain‑English definitions.

- **Too many abstract claims, not enough concrete showing.** The draft *tells* us the imagery is “metallurgical” or that a phrase “functions as an inclusio,” but often doesn’t pause to let the reader actually *see* the Hebrew and feel how the lines work. More short, well‑chosen Hebrew+English quotations from parallels (Micah 7:2, Proverbs on speech, Psalms 17/34/64) would help.

- **Missed liturgical integration.** The current liturgical section is thin. It mentions Shemini Atzeret and Selichot, but doesn’t quote the relevant prayers in Hebrew+English or explain how those contexts shape how Jews hear the psalm.

- **Some research questions are raised but not clearly answered.** For example, the semantic distinction between חָסִיד and אֱמוּנִים, or the options for “them/him” in v.8, are discussed but could be synthesized more clearly.

- **Tone.** The tone is generally fine but a bit solemn and “scholarly article” in places. For this audience, we want “brilliant professor explaining things over coffee,” not “conference paper.”

Revisions should: (1) simplify and explain technical terms; (2) foreground the big structural arc; (3) use more examples from the Hebrew Bible and liturgy, quoted and translated; (4) explicitly answer several of the research questions; and (5) keep the focus on why these details make the poem more powerful and relevant.
