    "Is the sevenfold refinement in v.7 describing an actual ancient metallurgical process with seven stages, or is 'seven' purely symbolic of completeness?",
    "Who are the antecedents of the pronouns in v.8—does 'them' refer to God's words or the oppressed, and does 'him' refer to an individual, a collective, or back to the words?",
    "Why does the psalm end (v.9) with the wicked still roaming after God's promise of protection (vv.6-8)—is this theological tension intentional or does it suggest liturgical incompleteness?",
    "What does the obscure phrase 'יָפִיחַ לוֹ' (yafiach lo) in v.6 mean—is it 'breathe for him,' 'give relief,' 'speak boldly,' or something else entirely?",
    "How does the rare word 'זֻלּוּת' (zullut - baseness/vileness) function in v.9, and why does it appear only here in the Hebrew Bible?",
    "What is the relationship between 'חָסִיד' (chasid) and 'אֱמוּנִים' (emunim) in v.2—are these synonymous terms or do they represent distinct aspects of covenant faithfulness?",
    "Is there a thematic or symbolic connection between 'שְּׁמִינִית' (sheminith - eighth) in the superscription and 'שִׁבְעָתָיִם' (sevenfold) in v.7, or are these independent?",
