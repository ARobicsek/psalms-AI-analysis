#### A quick map of what we’re reading

Psalm 12 is short—nine verses in Hebrew—but it’s packed. The poet looks around and concludes that something basic has broken in his society. Not the economy. Not the army. **Language.**  

People lie easily, flatter for advantage, say one thing and mean another. The ones who actually live by חֶסֶד (*ḥesed*, “steadfast loyalty”) and אֱמוּנָה (*’emunah*, “trustworthiness”) seem to have disappeared. In the middle of this complaint, God suddenly speaks—a rare moment of direct divine speech inside a lament. God promises to rise up for the exploited poor. The psalmist responds by reflecting on how utterly reliable God’s words are—“silver refined seven times” (v.7)—yet the poem ends by admitting that the wicked are still prowling around (v.9).

So the emotional journey is:

1. “Help, the good people are gone and everyone lies” (vv.2–3)  
2. “Cut off these smooth, arrogant tongues!” (vv.4–5)  
3. God: “Now I will arise because of the poor” (v.6)  
4. “Your words are completely pure; you will guard your people—even though the wicked still roam” (vv.7–9)

#### When society breaks at the level of speech

The opening cry is blunt:

> הוֹשִׁיעָה יְהוָה, כִּי־גָמַר חָסִיד;  
> כִּי־פַסּוּ אֱמוּנִים, מִבְּנֵי אָדָם.  
> “Save, LORD, for the **ḥasid** is finished;  
> for the **faithful ones** have vanished from among the children of Adam.” (v.2)

Two key words here:

- **חָסִיד (*ḥāsid*)** comes from חֶסֶד (*ḥesed*), “steadfast love, covenant loyalty.” A *ḥāsid* is someone who *practices* loyal kindness—doing more than the bare minimum.
- **אֱמוּנִים (*’emunim*)** comes from the root אמן (*’mn*), “to be firm, reliable.” These are the *trustworthy* ones, whose word you can rely on.

So the poet isn’t just saying “nice people are rare.” He’s saying: people who *keep commitments* (ḥasid) and people whose *word is reliable* (’emunim) have “come to an end” (גָמַר) and “ceased” (פָסּוּ). Hyperbole? Probably, yes—biblical laments love exaggeration for effect—but it captures the feeling that you can’t trust anyone’s promises or statements anymore.

Notice the phrase **מִבְּנֵי אָדָם** (“from among the children of Adam”) here, and again at the end:

> כְּרֻם זֻלּוּת לִבְנֵי אָדָם  
> “when baseness is exalted among the children of Adam.” (v.9)

That repetition is an **inclusio**—a framing device where the same phrase at the beginning and end brackets the whole poem. The envelope here is “the human world,” which has gone linguistically rotten.

#### “Heart and heart”: the psychology of double speech

Verse 3 zooms in on how people now talk:

> שָׁוְא יְדַבְּרוּ, אִישׁ אֶת־רֵעֵהוּ;  
> שְׂפַת חֲלָקוֹת, בְּלֵב וָלֵב יְדַבֵּרוּ.  
> “Falsehood they speak, each to his fellow;  
> **smooth lips**—with **heart and heart** they speak.”

You’ve got three images:

- **שָׁוְא (*shav’*)** – “emptiness, lies, nothingness.” Their words are disconnected from reality.
- **שְׂפַת חֲלָקוֹת (*śefat ḥalaqot*)** – literally “smooth lips.” Smooth in Hebrew often implies *slippery* or *flattering* speech—pleasant on the surface, dangerous underneath (compare Ps 55:22: *“חָלְקוּ מַחְמָאֹת פִּיו… וְהֵמָּה פְתִחֽוֹת”* – “his words were smoother than butter… yet they were drawn swords”).
- **בְּלֵב וָלֵב (*b’lev va‑lev*)** – literally “with heart and heart.” This idiom shows up only here and once in 1 Chronicles 12:34, where the negative form means wholehearted loyalty:  
  > וְלַעֲדֹר בְּלֹא־לֵב וָלֵב  
  > “to help **without heart and heart**” = with an *undivided* heart.
  
So “heart and heart” is the opposite of the Shema’s “בְּכָל־לְבָבְךָ” (“with all your heart,” Deut 6:5). It pictures a person with two internal centers—one heart for show, one heart for what they really intend. Rashi (11th‑c. France) puts it nicely: *“לי מראים שלום, ויש שנאה טמונה בלבבם”*—“To me they show peace, but hatred is hidden in their heart.”

This is why language matters so much here: it’s not only about individual lies; it’s about a *split self* leaking out through words.

#### When people say, “Our lips are our own”

The poem then does something clever: it *quotes* the arrogant speakers.

> לִלְשֹׁנֵנוּ נַגְבִּיר; שְׂפָתֵינוּ אִתָּנוּ, מִי אָדוֹן לָנוּ.  
> “With our tongue we will prevail;  
> our lips are with us—who is master over us?” (v.5)

Three claims in three short phrases:

1. **“With our tongue we will prevail”** – speech as a weapon and tool of power.
2. **“Our lips are with us”** – our speech organs are *ours*, under our control, owing nothing to anyone.
3. **“Who is master over us?”** – a rhetorical question: they reject any higher authority, especially over what they say.

The Talmud picks up this verse to define **לשון הרע (lashon hara)**—“evil speech.” In Arakhin 15b we read: *“כל המספר לשון הרע כאילו כפר בעיקר, שנאמר… מִי אָדוֹן לָנוּ”*—“Whoever speaks evil speech, it is as if he denied the fundamental principle [God], as it is said, ‘Who is master over us?’” In other words, claiming total autonomy over your tongue is, in practice, atheism.

#### God breaks into the conversation

Suddenly, in verse 6, a new voice:

> מִשֹּׁד עֲנִיִּים, מֵאֶנְקַת אֶבְיוֹנִים;  
> עַתָּה אָקוּם, יֹאמַר יְהוָה;  
> אָשִׁית בְּיֵשַׁע, יָפִיחַ לוֹ.  
> “Because of the devastation of the poor, the sighing of the needy—  
> **Now I will arise**, says the LORD;  
> I will place [him] in safety—he pants for it / I will speak it to him.”

This is a little **oracle**—a direct divine message inside the psalm. That’s rare. Most laments move from complaint to confidence without quoting God. Here, by contrast, we get a mini “Thus says the LORD” moment (note the formula *יֹאמַר יְהוָה*).

Two more paired words:

- **עֲנִיִּים (*’aniyyim*)** – “poor, afflicted.”
- **אֶבְיוֹנִים (*’evyonim*)** – “needy, destitute.”  

These are classic prophetic terms for people being economically and socially crushed. Likely they *are* the missing ḥasid and ’emunim of v.2: the people who remain loyal and honest are exactly the ones getting exploited.

The tricky phrase is **אָשִׁית בְּיֵשַׁע יָפִיחַ לוֹ**. The verb **יָפִיחַ (*yafiaḥ*)** literally means “to blow, breathe out,” and by extension “to utter, speak boldly.” Readings include:

- “I will **place him in** deliverance, for which he gasps” – God rescues the one *panting* for help.
- Or (Malbim): “I will **speak** salvation to him” – God’s *word* of help becomes the help.

Either way, God’s response to corrupt speech is, fittingly, **more speech**—but speech that actually does something.

#### Silver in the dirt: why God’s words are different

Verse 7 then steps back and reflects:

> אִמְרוֹת יְהוָה, אֲמָרוֹת טְהֹרוֹת;  
> כֶּסֶף צָרוּף, בַּעֲלִיל לָאָרֶץ;  
> מְזֻקָּק, שִׁבְעָתָיִם.  
> “The sayings of the LORD are pure sayings:  
> silver refined in an earthen crucible,  
> purified sevenfold.”

A couple of details:

- **אִמְרוֹת (*imrot*)** instead of דְבָרִים (*devarim*): both mean “words,” but *imrot* is a more poetic term, often used for divine promises (cf. Ps 18:31, 119:140, Prov 30:5).
- **כֶּסֶף צָרוּף… מְזֻקָּק שִׁבְעָתָיִם** – we’re in the world of ancient metallurgy. Silver ore was refined in a clay crucible sunk into the ground, heated repeatedly to burn off impurities. “Sevenfold” might reflect an actual multi‑stage process, but in biblical symbolism seven is “complete.” The point: God’s words have *no alloy*. No double heart, no hidden agenda.

Compare Psalm 18:31:

> אִמְרַת יְהוָה צְרוּפָה; מָגֵן הוּא לְכׇל הַחֹסִים בּוֹ.  
> “The word of the LORD is *refined*; He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.”

Psalm 12 pushes this further: not just “refined,” but refined *seven times*.

Notice also the subtle number play: the superscription says the psalm is “**עַל הַשְּׁמִינִית**” (*‘al ha‑sheminit*, “on the eighth [something]”)—probably a musical instruction for an eight‑stringed instrument or a lower octave. Later we meet **שִׁבְעָתָיִם** (“sevenfold”). In biblical thought, seven often signals perfection within the created order (seven days, seven years), while eight can hint at going beyond the ordinary (circumcision on the eighth day, Shemini Atzeret as the “eighth day” festival). You could hear the psalm as moving from “the eighth” in the heading, down through “sevenfold refinement” in the center, into the messy, less‑than‑perfect human world at the end.

#### Who exactly is being protected?

Verse 8 says:

> אַתָּה יְהוָה, תִּשְׁמְרֵם;  
> תִּצְּרֶנּוּ, מִן־הַדּוֹר זוּ לְעוֹלָם.  
> “You, LORD, will **keep them**;  
> you will **guard him** from this generation forever.”

The shift from plural “them” (תִּשְׁמְרֵם) to singular “him” (תִּצְּרֶנּוּ) has kept commentators busy:

- Traditional view (Radak, Metzudat David): “them” = the poor/needy; “him” = each individual among them. So: God will guard *all of them* and also *each one*.
- Other readers: “them” = God’s **words** from v.7, which He preserves; “him” = the person who trusts those words. In that case: God both preserves His promises from distortion and protects the believer living in a corrupt generation.

Either way, the phrase **מִן־הַדּוֹר זוּ** (“from this generation”) probably means not just “from people born between certain years,” but “from this kind of generation”—one defined by flattery, lies, and moral upside‑down.

The verbs themselves matter: **שָׁמַר (*shamar*)** means “to keep, watch, guard”; **נָצַר (*natsar*)** also “to guard, protect.” Together they pile up the sense of continuous, active protection.

#### A deliberately uneasy ending

You might expect the last verse to celebrate victory: God has spoken, the poor are safe, the liars are silenced. Instead:

> סָבִיב רְשָׁעִים יִתְהַלָּכוּן;  
> כְּרֻם זֻלּוּת לִבְנֵי אָדָם.  
> “All around, the wicked keep walking;  
> when baseness is exalted among the children of Adam.” (v.9)

Two things:

- **סָבִיב… יִתְהַלָּכוּן** – “they walk around everywhere.” Same verb (hitpa’el of הלך) used of wandering; it suggests restless, ongoing activity. Psalm 34:8 gives the positive counterpart: *“חֹנֶה מַלְאַךְ־יְהוָה סָבִיב לִירֵאָיו”*—“the angel of the LORD encamps **around** those who fear Him.” In Psalm 12, that “around” is filled by wicked people, not protecting angels.
- **כְּרֻם זֻלּוּת** – literally “when worthlessness (זֻלּוּת, a hapax = “vileness, baseness”) is lifted up / exalted (רום) among humans.” So the wicked roam freely *precisely* when trashy behavior is admired, trending, platformed.

So Psalm 12 ends in tension. God’s words are absolutely reliable; God promises to rise and guard the oppressed; and yet—for now—the world still looks like Twitter on a bad day. That’s not a failure of faith; it’s a brutally realistic picture of what it feels like to live between promise and fulfillment, trying to keep your own tongue honest in a culture where “smooth lips” are winning.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

#### Full psalm

In the **Edot ha‑Mizrach** (Sephardi/Mizrahi) tradition, Psalm 12 is recited in full at **Ma‘ariv on Shemini Atzeret**, the “eighth day” festival after Sukkot—nicely echoing the superscription עַל־הַשְּׁמִינִית (“on the eighth”). It opens a small unit of verses before the festival *Amidah*, followed by the passage about the festivals, *אֵלֶּה מוֹעֲדֵי יְהוָה*, and then *Chatzi Kaddish*. The community thus enters the central prayer of the night having just said:

> הוֹשִׁיעָה יְהוָה כִּי־גָמַר חָסִיד…  
> “Save, LORD, for the pious one is gone…”  

and

> אִמְרוֹת יְהוָה אֲמָרוֹת טְהֹרוֹת…  
> “The sayings of the LORD are pure sayings…”  

That placement turns the psalm into a kind of spiritual “sound‑check”: we admit how fragile human words are and ask to stand before God relying on *His* speech, not ours.

#### Key verses

**Psalm 12:2 – Selichot**

> הוֹשִׁיעָה יְהוָה כִּי־גָמַר חָסִיד, כִּי־פַסּוּ אֱמוּנִים מִבְּנֵי אָדָם.  
> “Save, LORD, for the pious has ceased; for the faithful have vanished from among humankind.”

This verse appears in several **Sephardi Selichot** (penitential prayers before the High Holidays), woven into strings of biblical cries. One common sequence goes:

> כִּי אַתָּה אֲדֹנָי טוֹב וְסַלָּח…  
> הוֹשִׁיעָה יְהוָה כִּי גָמַר חָסִיד כִּי פַסּוּ אֱמוּנִים מִבְּנֵי אָדָם;  
> כִּי אָדָם אֵין צַדִּיק בָּאָרֶץ אֲשֶׁר יַעֲשֶׂה־טּוֹב וְלֹא יֶחֱטָא.  

“For You, my Lord, are good and forgiving… Save, LORD, for the pious has ceased… For there is no righteous person on earth who does good and does not sin.” In this context the community basically says: “We *are* that generation with few ḥasidim and ’emunim; please save us anyway.”

**Psalm 12:7 – Shir ha‑Yichud**

> אִמְרוֹת יְהוָה אֲמָרוֹת טְהֹרוֹת…  
> “The sayings of the LORD are pure sayings…”

Medieval piyyutim (liturgical poems) sometimes quote this line. In **Shir ha‑Yichud** (“Song of Unity”), recited in some communities on Shabbat or Yom Kippur night, we find:

> בַּעֲבוּר יִשְׁמְרוּ חֻקִּים וְתוֹרוֹת,  
> אִמְרוֹת יְהוָה אֲמָרוֹת טְהוֹרוֹת.  

“So that they may keep statutes and laws—  
the sayings of the LORD, pure sayings.”  

Here Psalm 12:7 becomes a slogan for **Torah itself** as perfectly trustworthy speech.

#### Phrases

Several Psalm‑12 phrases reappear in liturgical or rabbinic contexts, even when the psalm isn’t being quoted directly.

- **אִישׁ אֶת־רֵעֵהוּ (“a man [to] his fellow,” v.3)** turns up in *Pirkei Avot* 3:2, studied weekly in many communities:  
  > שֶׁאִלְמָלֵא מוֹרָאָהּ, אִישׁ אֶת־רֵעֵהוּ חַיִּים בָּלָעוּ.  
  > “Were it not for the fear [of government], a man would swallow his fellow alive.”  
  The phrase helps frame Psalm 12’s “each one lies to his fellow” as part of a larger Jewish worry about social breakdown.

- The rabbis also cite **v.5** when talking about **lashon hara** (evil speech). In Arakhin 15b:  
  > כׇּל הַמְסַפֵּר לָשׁוֹן הָרָע כְּאִלּוּ כָּפַר בָּעִקָּר, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר… מִי אָדוֹן לָנוּ.  
  > “Whoever speaks evil speech is as if he denied the fundamental [of faith], as it is said… ‘Who is master over us?’”  
  So a line born in poetry ends up shaping halakhic and ethical discussions about how Jews speak to one another.
