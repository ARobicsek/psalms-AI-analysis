# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 12

The existing introduction has real strengths. It sees clearly that Psalm 12 is about the breakdown of language as a social glue, and it rightly treats verse 6 as the hinge where God’s own speech interrupts human mendacity. The discussion of key Hebrew terms—חָסִיד (*ḥāsid*), אֱמוּנִים (*’emunim*), “heart and heart” (בְּלֵב וָלֵב), “smooth lips” (שְׂפַת חֲלָקוֹת), and the metallurgical image of verse 7—is accurate and often illuminating. The tone is generally lucid and accessible.

There are, however, several weaknesses. The introduction is dense and occasionally drifts into dissertation‑style prose. It assumes the reader will happily follow long lexicon digressions and multiple medieval views without enough explanation of why they matter. Some of the most interesting questions raised in the macro/micro analysis are left dangling: the pronoun puzzle in verse 8, the precise nuance of יָפִיחַ in verse 6, the function of זֻלּוּת in verse 9, and the possible relationship between שְׁמִינִית (“eighth”) and שִׁבְעָתַיִם (“sevenfold”). 

The verse‑by‑verse notes are generally solid but could be more sharply focused. Figurative language parallels are underused; when they are mentioned (e.g., “smooth lips,” refining imagery), they are not consistently illustrated with Hebrew citations from elsewhere in the Bible. The rich liturgical material (Selichot, Shemini Atzeret, *Shir HaYichud*) is barely exploited. Torah Temimah’s aggadic uses and rabbinic readings of lashon hara (evil speech) are noted but not fully integrated into the theological portrait of the psalm. 

Revisions should (1) streamline jargon and define technical terms, (2) foreground a clear structural reading of the psalm, (3) answer answerable macro/micro questions, (4) quote more biblical and liturgical Hebrew with translation, especially for figurative patterns, and (5) bring the liturgical afterlife of select verses into the center of the interpretation rather than leaving it as an appendix.
