      "What is the relationship between the 'plundered poor' ('ăniyyîm) and 'needy' ('eḇyônîm) in v. 6 and the vanished 'faithful' in v. 2—are they the same group, or does the psalm shift focus?",
      "How does the verb 'cut off' (yakhreṯ) in v. 4 function in judgment contexts elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible—is this covenant curse language?",
      "What is the 'sheminith' in the superscription (v. 1), and could its meaning (eighth, octave, eight-stringed) relate thematically to the psalm's concern with perfect/complete speech?",
      "How does Psalm 12's concern with corrupt speech relate to wisdom literature's speech ethics (Proverbs) and to prophetic denunciations of social injustice (Isaiah, Micah)?",
