Psalm 12 is a short poem with a long reach. It is one of the Bible’s sharpest diagnoses of what happens to a society when words can no longer be trusted. The poet does not complain about taxes, foreign powers, or drought. His crisis is linguistic:

> הוֹשִׁ֣יעָה יְהוָ֣ה כִּֽי־גָמַ֣ר חָסִ֑יד  
> כִּֽי־פַסּ֥וּ אֱמוּנִ֗ים מִבְּנֵ֥י אָדָֽם׃  
> “Help, O LORD! For the faithful are no more;  
> the loyal have vanished from the sons of men.” (v. 2)

The key terms here already sketch the psalm’s world. חָסִיד (*ḥāsid*) derives from חֶסֶד (*ḥesed*), “steadfast love,” and in biblical usage denotes one who actively practices covenantal kindness. אֱמוּנִים (*’emunim*) comes from the root אמן, “to be firm, reliable”; it means “the trustworthy,” those whose promises hold. As Brown–Driver–Briggs notes, the second term shades from “faithful ones” to “faithfulness” itself, and the Greek translators tilt in that direction, rendering אֱמוּנִים as ἀλήθεια, “truth.” In the poet’s experience, both the people who embody loyalty and the very quality of reliability have “come to an end” (גָמַר) and “vanished” (פָסּוּ).

This is deliberate hyperbole, the stock‑in‑trade of lament. Micah later gives a similar cry:  

> “אָבַ֤ד חָסִיד֙ מִן־הָאָ֔רֶץ וְיָשָׁ֥ר בָּאָדָ֖ם אָ֑יִן”  
> “The ḥasid has perished from the land; there is no upright person among humanity” (Mic 7:2).

The point is not statistical but existential. The speaker feels himself to be living in a moral vacuum. Rabbinic tradition seized on this perception. The Talmud laments that after the Temple’s destruction “פסקו אנשי אמנה מישראל” – “men of faith ceased from Israel,” and proves it by quoting our verse: “הוֹשִׁיעָה יְהוָה כִּי גָמַר חָסִיד” (Sotah 48a).

From there the poem focuses relentlessly on speech. Verse 3 offers a triptych:

> שָׁוְא יְדַבְּרוּ אִישׁ אֶת־רֵעֵהוּ;  
> שְׂפַת חֲלָקוֹת; בְּלֵב וָלֵב יְדַבֵּרוּ׃  
> “They speak *shav’*—emptiness, lies—each to his fellow;  
> smooth lips; with heart and heart they speak.”

First, language is *shav’*, a word that ranges from “nothingness” to “deception.” Words have been untethered from reality. Second, their speech is “smooth lips” (שְׂפַת חֲלָקוֹת). In other psalms the same root describes treacherous speech:  

> “לְשׁוֹנָם יַחֲלִיקוּן” – “their tongue is slippery” (Ps 5:10);  
> “חָלְקוּ מַחְמָאֹת פִּיו… רַכּוּ דְבָרָיו מִשֶּׁמֶן וְהֵמָּה פְתִחוֹת” –  
> “his talk was smoother than butter… yet they were drawn swords” (Ps 55:22).

The metaphor is tactile: a smooth surface looks safe but offers no grip. Finally comes the rare idiom “בְּלֵב וָלֵב,” literally “with heart and heart.” It appears only here and in 1 Chronicles 12:34, where the men of Zebulun are praised for supporting David “בְּלֹא־לֵב וָלֵב,” “without double heart,” that is, with undivided loyalty. Our psalm coins its dark mirror‑image: a person with two hearts, one for display, one concealed. It is the antithesis of the Shema’s ideal, “בְּכָל־לְבָבְךָ” – “with all your heart” (Deut 6:5).

In verses 4–5 the poet takes aim at the organs of such speech—lips and tongue—and at the ideology that underlies them. He prays:

> “יַכְרֵת יְהוָה כָּל־שִׂפְתֵי חֲלָקוֹת;  
> לָשׁוֹן מְדַבֶּרֶת גְּדֹלוֹת׃” (v. 4)  
> “May the LORD cut off all flattering lips,  
> the tongue that speaks great things.”

The verb כרת (“cut off”) is the standard term for being excluded from the covenant community. Here it is applied not to idolaters or Sabbath violators but to “smooth lips” and “tongue speaking grandes choses,” a phrase echoed in Daniel’s vision of the arrogant horn that “speaks great things” against God (Dan 7:8, 20). Rabbinic tradition took this language with utmost seriousness. Maimonides, discussing *lashon hara* (evil speech), cites our verse: “Scripture says of those who speak disparagingly of others, ‘May the Lord cut off all smooth lips, the tongue that speaks proud things’” (Hilchot De’ot 7:2). The *Torah Temimah* even quotes an opinion that a habitual slanderer “has no remedy, for David has already cut him off” by this prayer.

Verse 5 then gives us the oppressors in their own words:

> “לִלְשֹׁנֵנוּ נַגְבִּיר; שְׂפָתֵינוּ אִתָּנוּ; מִי אָדוֹן לָנוּ׃”  
> “With our tongue we will prevail; our lips are with us—who is master over us?”

Language here is not for communication but domination. “Our lips are with us” asserts radical autonomy: these instruments of speech belong entirely to us; no one, human or divine, has jurisdiction over what we do with them. The Talmud draws the theological conclusion: “Whoever speaks *lashon hara* is as if he denies the fundamental principle, as it is said, ‘Our tongue we will make strong… who is master over us?’” (Arakhin 15b). Evil speech, in this reading, is not a minor social offense but practical atheism.

At the center of the psalm, something astonishing happens. After five verses of human voices—first the poet’s cry, then the wicked’s boasting—God speaks:

> “מִשֹּׁד עֲנִיִּים מֵאֶנְקַת אֶבְיוֹנִים,  
> עַתָּה אָקוּם יֹאמַר יְהוָה;  
> אָשִׁית בְּיֵשַׁע יָפִיחַ לוֹ׃” (v. 6)  
> “Because of the plundering of the poor,  
> because of the groaning of the needy,  
> ‘Now I will arise,’ says YHWH;  
> ‘I will place him in the safety for which he yearns.’”

Direct divine speech inside a lament psalm is unusual. Elsewhere we hear formulas like “God has spoken in His holiness” (Ps 60:8), but here, as in Isaiah 33:10 (“עַתָּה אָקוּם יֹאמַר יְהוָה”), we have a full prophetic oracle, with the classic “says YHWH” formula. Many scholars imagine a liturgical setting: a communal complaint sung in the temple, to which a priest‑prophet responded with God’s answer.

Notice what provokes God to “arise”: not abstract blasphemy but the concrete “plundering of the poor” (*shod ‘aniyyim*) and the “groaning” of the destitute. The vocabulary—עֲנִיִּים (*aniyyim*) and אֶבְיוֹנִים (*’evyonim*)—is the standard prophetic shorthand for the economically vulnerable. Those who have mastered the art of deceitful speech have translated it into material exploitation.

The last clause is notoriously difficult: “אָשִׁית בְּיֵשַׁע יָפִיחַ לוֹ.” The root פוח (*puaḥ*) means “to breathe, puff, pant,” and by extension “to utter.” Elsewhere it is used of false testimony (“one who breathes out lies,” Prov 14:5) and of a vision that “pants toward the end” (Hab 2:3). One can hear both senses here: “I will set him in the safety for which he pants,” and “I will ‘breathe out’ salvation to him,” that is, speak a saving word. The ambiguity is part of the point. In this psalm, God’s speech is not commentary added after the fact; it is itself an act of rescue.

Verses 7–8 then meditate on the contrast between human and divine words:

> “אִמְרוֹת יְהוָה אֲמָרוֹת טְהֹרוֹת;  
> כֶּסֶף צָרוּף בַּעֲלִיל לָאָרֶץ, מְזֻקָּק שִׁבְעָתָיִם׃”  
> “The words of YHWH are pure words,  
> silver refined in an earthen crucible, purified sevenfold.” (v. 7)

The choice of אִמְרוֹת (*’imrot*, “utterances”) instead of the more prosaic דְּבָרִים (*devarim*, “words”) gives a formal, almost oracular tone; the same term recurs in Psalm 18:31, “אִמְרַת יְהוָה צְרוּפָה” – “the word of YHWH is refined.” The metallurgical metaphor is unusually detailed: we have silver (כֶּסֶף), the refining process (צָרוּף, מְזֻקָּק), the vessel (בַּעֲלִיל לָאָרֶץ, probably an earthen crucible set into the ground), and the number of cycles—“sevenfold,” the biblical number of completeness. Elsewhere the same vocabulary is used for God’s testing of people: “צְרַפְתָּנוּ כִּצְרֹף כָּסֶף” – “You refined us as silver is refined” (Ps 66:10). Here the emphasis falls on the *result*: God’s promises are like silver that has been run through the fire until every trace of dross is gone.

The superscription’s enigmatic “עַל־הַשְּׁמִינִית” (“upon the sheminith,” v. 1) may lurk in the background. The word literally means “eighth” and is probably a musical direction (perhaps an eight‑stringed instrument), as Rashi already suggests. Yet it is hard not to notice the interplay: a psalm played “on the eighth” about words refined “sevenfold.” In biblical symbolism, seven marks a full cycle; eight can suggest what lies beyond completion—the circumcision on the eighth day, the festival of *Shemini Atzeret* after seven days of Sukkot. One might say: if human language at its best is seven times purified, the God who stands over it is “eighth,” beyond our cycles.

Verse 8 adds a delicate pronoun puzzle:

> “אַתָּה יְהוָה תִּשְׁמְרֵם; תִּצְּרֶנּוּ מִן־הַדּוֹר זּוּ לְעוֹלָם׃”  
> “You, O LORD, will keep *them*;  
> you will guard *him* from this generation forever.”

Whom does God keep and whom does He guard? The plural “them” could refer back to God’s “words” in verse 7 or to the “poor and needy” of verse 6; the singular “him” might be a generic individual within that group. Traditional Jewish commentators mostly take both pronouns to refer to the oppressed: “You will guard the poor,” says Radak, “each and every poor person wherever he may be among the oppressors.” Ibn Ezra suggests the first pronoun points to the divine utterances, which God faithfully keeps, while the second points to the human recipient of those words. The ambiguity is almost programmatic. In Psalm 12, guarding God’s words and guarding God’s people are inseparable acts.

Finally, we reach the disquieting close:

> “סָבִיב רְשָׁעִים יִתְהַלָּכוּן;  
> כְּרֻם זֻלּוּת לִבְנֵי אָדָם׃” (v. 9)  
> “On every side the wicked prowl,  
> while vileness is exalted among the sons of men.”

The verb יִתְהַלָּכוּן (“they walk about”) in its reflexive form suggests restless, self‑directed movement: the wicked are not merely present; they roam. The phrase סָבִיב (“around, all around”) answers our sense that there is no safe direction to turn. The rare noun זֻלּוּת—built from a root meaning “cheap, lightly esteemed”—means “worthlessness, baseness.” When such things are “raised high” (כְּרֻם), when what ought to be despised is on the pedestal, the wicked flourish.

The psalm does not resolve this tension. God has spoken; His words are pure; the poor are under His protection. And yet, “all around the wicked walk.” That is where the congregation singing this psalm must live: between the oracle and its fulfillment, trusting a speech that is “refined sevenfold” in a culture where smooth lies still sell. The psalm’s closing line may be bleak, but it is not hopeless. It is an honest acknowledgement that the corruption of language is not cured overnight—that faithfulness, whether human or divine, must often be kept in the teeth of what everyone around us is saying.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

#### Full psalm

In contemporary Jewish practice, Psalm 12 is recited in its entirety in the Sephardic/Mizrahi (*Edot ha‑Mizrach*) tradition at the evening service of *Shemini Atzeret*, the “eighth day” that closes the Sukkot festival. It is included in a chain of verses and psalms preceding the festival *Amidah*. The congregation thus begins the climactic prayer of the pilgrimage season with David’s cry, “הוֹשִׁיעָה יְהוָה כִּי גָמַר חָסִיד” – “Help, O LORD, for the ḥasid has vanished” (v. 2), and with the assurance, “אִמְרוֹת יְהוָה אֲמָרוֹת טְהֹרוֹת” – “The words of YHWH are pure words” (v. 7). The numerical echo between *Shemini* (“eighth”) and the superscription “עַל־הַשְּׁמִינִית” has not been lost on later readers.

#### Key verses

Verse 2, “הוֹשִׁיעָה יְהוָה כִּי־גָמַר חָסִיד; כִּי־פַסּוּ אֱמוּנִים מִבְּנֵי אָדָם” (“Help, O LORD, for the ḥasid is finished; for the faithful have vanished from the sons of men”), is incorporated into the *Selichot*—the penitential prayers recited in Elul and the Ten Days of Repentance—in many Sephardic rites. A typical sequence weaves it together with other verses of divine mercy and human frailty:

> “כִּי אַתָּה אֲדֹנָי טוֹב וְסַלָּח, וְרַב חֶסֶד לְכׇל קֹרְאֶיךָ;  
> הוֹשִׁיעָה יְהוָה כִּי גָמַר חָסִיד כִּי פַסּוּ אֱמוּנִים מִבְּנֵי אָדָם;  
> כִּי אָדָם אֵין צַדִּיק בָּאָרֶץ, אֲשֶׁר יַעֲשֶׂה טוֹב וְלֹא יֶחֱטָא׃”

“For You, Lord, are good and forgiving, and abundant in kindness to all who call upon You (Ps 86:5); help, O LORD, for the pious has ceased… (Ps 12:2); for there is no righteous man on earth who does good and does not sin (Eccl 7:20).” Placed in this chain, our verse becomes a communal confession: we ourselves may be the missing “faithful.”

#### Phrases

The line “אִמְרוֹת יְהוָה אֲמָרוֹת טְהוֹרוֹת” (“The words of YHWH are pure words,” v. 7) enters the liturgy through the medieval poem *Shir ha‑Yichud* (“Song of Unity”), recited in some communities on Yom Kippur eve or as a mystical supplement to Shabbat. Describing God’s care for Israel in the wilderness, the poet writes:

> “בַּעֲבוּר יִשְׁמְרוּ חֻקִּים וְתוֹרוֹת,  
> אִמְרוֹת יְהוָה אֲמָרוֹת טְהוֹרוֹת.”

“[He sustained them] so that they would keep statutes and laws, the words of YHWH, pure words.” Here Psalm 12’s contrast between duplicitous human speech and pure divine utterance is read as a description of Torah itself.

The commonplace phrase “אִישׁ אֶת־רֵעֵהוּ” (“each man his fellow,” v. 3) reappears homiletically in *Pirkei Avot* 3:2, a tractate traditionally studied on Shabbat afternoons: “שֶׁאִלְמָלֵא מוֹרָאָהּ, אִישׁ אֶת־רֵעֵהוּ חַיִּים בָּלָעוּ” – “were it not for fear of [the government], a man would swallow his fellow alive.” Our psalm’s description of people speaking *shav’* “each to his fellow” becomes, in rabbinic imagination, a portrait of social disintegration that only law and reverence can restrain.

A more allusive use of Psalm 12 appears in some Ashkenazic piyyutim for Yom Kippur, which lament generations “הַמְדַבְּרִים חֲלָקוֹת בְּלֵב” – “who speak smooth things, with a heart [and] a heart,” echoing verse 3’s indictment. On the holiest night of the year, the charge of “double‑hearted” speech is turned inward: we confess that we too have maintained one heart for God and another for convenience.
