# Commentary on Psalm 12
---
## Introduction
Psalm 12 is a short poem with a long reach. It is one of the Bible’s sharpest diagnoses of what happens to a society when words can no longer be trusted. The poet does not complain about taxes, foreign powers, or drought. His crisis is linguistic:
> הוֹשִׁ֣יעָה ה׳ כִּֽי־גָמַ֣ר חָסִ֑יד  
> כִּֽי־פַסּ֥וּ אֱמוּנִ֗ים מִבְּנֵ֥י אָדָֽם׃  
> “Help, O LORD! For the faithful are no more;  
> the loyal have vanished from the sons of men.” (v. 2)
The key terms here already sketch the psalm’s world. חָסִיד (*ḥāsid*) derives from חֶסֶד (*ḥesed*), “steadfast love,” and in biblical usage denotes one who actively practices covenantal kindness. אֱמוּנִים (*’emunim*) comes from the root אמן, “to be firm, reliable”; it means “the trustworthy,” those whose promises hold. As Brown–Driver–Briggs notes, the second term shades from “faithful ones” to “faithfulness” itself, and the Greek translators tilt in that direction, rendering אֱמוּנִים as ἀλήθεια, “truth.” In the poet’s experience, both the people who embody loyalty and the very quality of reliability have “come to an end” (גָמַר) and “vanished” (פָסּוּ).
This is deliberate hyperbole, the stock‑in‑trade of lament. Micah later gives a similar cry:  
> “אָבַ֤ד חָסִיד֙ מִן־הָאָ֔רֶץ וְיָשָׁ֥ר בָּאָדָ֖ם אָ֑יִן”  
> “The ḥasid has perished from the land; there is no upright person among humanity” (Mic 7:2).
The point is not statistical but existential. The speaker feels himself to be living in a moral vacuum. Rabbinic tradition seized on this perception. The Talmud laments that after the Temple’s destruction “פסקו אנשי אמנה מישראל” – “men of faith ceased from Israel,” and proves it by quoting our verse: “הוֹשִׁיעָה ה׳ כִּי גָמַר חָסִיד” (Sotah 48a).
From there the poem focuses relentlessly on speech. Verse 3 offers a triptych:
> שָׁוְא יְדַבְּרוּ אִישׁ אֶת־רֵעֵהוּ;  
> שְׂפַת חֲלָקוֹת; בְּלֵב וָלֵב יְדַבֵּרוּ׃  
> “They speak *shav’*—emptiness, lies—each to his fellow;  
> smooth lips; with heart and heart they speak.”
First, language is *shav’*, a word that ranges from “nothingness” to “deception.” Words have been untethered from reality. Second, their speech is “smooth lips” (שְׂפַת חֲלָקוֹת). In other psalms the same root describes treacherous speech:  
> “לְשׁוֹנָם יַחֲלִיקוּן” – “their tongue is slippery” (Ps 5:10);  
> “חָלְקוּ מַחְמָאֹת פִּיו… רַכּוּ דְבָרָיו מִשֶּׁמֶן וְהֵמָּה פְתִחוֹת” –  
> “his talk was smoother than butter… yet they were drawn swords” (Ps 55:22).
The metaphor is tactile: a smooth surface looks safe but offers no grip. Finally comes the rare idiom “בְּלֵב וָלֵב,” literally “with heart and heart.” It appears only here and in 1 Chronicles 12:34, where the men of Zebulun are praised for supporting David “בְּלֹא־לֵב וָלֵב,” “without double heart,” that is, with undivided loyalty. Our psalm coins its dark mirror‑image: a person with two hearts, one for display, one concealed. It is the antithesis of the Shema’s ideal, “בְּכָל־לְבָבְךָ” – “with all your heart” (Deut 6:5).
In verses 4–5 the poet takes aim at the organs of such speech—lips and tongue—and at the ideology that underlies them. He prays:
> “יַכְרֵת ה׳ כָּל־שִׂפְתֵי חֲלָקוֹת;  
> לָשׁוֹן מְדַבֶּרֶת גְּדֹלוֹת׃” (v. 4)  
> “May the LORD cut off all flattering lips,  
> the tongue that speaks great things.”
The verb כרת (“cut off”) is the standard term for being excluded from the covenant community. Here it is applied not to idolaters or Sabbath violators but to “smooth lips” and “tongue speaking grandes choses,” a phrase echoed in Daniel’s vision of the arrogant horn that “speaks great things” against God (Dan 7:8, 20). Rabbinic tradition took this language with utmost seriousness. Maimonides, discussing *lashon hara* (evil speech), cites our verse: “Scripture says of those who speak disparagingly of others, ‘May the Lord cut off all smooth lips, the tongue that speaks proud things’” (Hilchot De’ot 7:2). The *Torah Temimah* even quotes an opinion that a habitual slanderer “has no remedy, for David has already cut him off” by this prayer.
Verse 5 then gives us the oppressors in their own words:
> “לִלְשֹׁנֵנוּ נַגְבִּיר; שְׂפָתֵינוּ אִתָּנוּ; מִי אָדוֹן לָנוּ׃”  
> “With our tongue we will prevail; our lips are with us—who is master over us?”
Language here is not for communication but domination. “Our lips are with us” asserts radical autonomy: these instruments of speech belong entirely to us; no one, human or divine, has jurisdiction over what we do with them. The Talmud draws the theological conclusion: “Whoever speaks *lashon hara* is as if he denies the fundamental principle, as it is said, ‘Our tongue we will make strong… who is master over us?’” (Arakhin 15b). Evil speech, in this reading, is not a minor social offense but practical atheism.
At the center of the psalm, something astonishing happens. After five verses of human voices—first the poet’s cry, then the wicked’s boasting—God speaks:
> “מִשֹּׁד עֲנִיִּים מֵאֶנְקַת אֶבְיוֹנִים,  
> עַתָּה אָקוּם יֹאמַר ה׳;  
> אָשִׁית בְּיֵשַׁע יָפִיחַ לוֹ׃” (v. 6)  
> “Because of the plundering of the poor,  
> because of the groaning of the needy,  
> ‘Now I will arise,’ says YHWH;  
> ‘I will place him in the safety for which he yearns.’”
Direct divine speech inside a lament psalm is unusual. Elsewhere we hear formulas like “God has spoken in His holiness” (Ps 60:8), but here, as in Isaiah 33:10 (“עַתָּה אָקוּם יֹאמַר ה׳”), we have a full prophetic oracle, with the classic “says YHWH” formula. Many scholars imagine a liturgical setting: a communal complaint sung in the temple, to which a priest‑prophet responded with God’s answer.
Notice what provokes God to “arise”: not abstract blasphemy but the concrete “plundering of the poor” (*shod ‘aniyyim*) and the “groaning” of the destitute. The vocabulary—עֲנִיִּים (*aniyyim*) and אֶבְיוֹנִים (*’evyonim*)—is the standard prophetic shorthand for the economically vulnerable. Those who have mastered the art of deceitful speech have translated it into material exploitation.
The last clause is notoriously difficult: “אָשִׁית בְּיֵשַׁע יָפִיחַ לוֹ.” The root פוח (*puaḥ*) means “to breathe, puff, pant,” and by extension “to utter.” Elsewhere it is used of false testimony (“one who breathes out lies,” Prov 14:5) and of a vision that “pants toward the end” (Hab 2:3). One can hear both senses here: “I will set him in the safety for which he pants,” and “I will ‘breathe out’ salvation to him,” that is, speak a saving word. The ambiguity is part of the point. In this psalm, God’s speech is not commentary added after the fact; it is itself an act of rescue.
Verses 7–8 then meditate on the contrast between human and divine words:
> “אִמְרוֹת ה׳ אֲמָרוֹת טְהֹרוֹת;  
> כֶּסֶף צָרוּף בַּעֲלִיל לָאָרֶץ, מְזֻקָּק שִׁבְעָתָיִם׃”  
> “The words of YHWH are pure words,  
> silver refined in an earthen crucible, purified sevenfold.” (v. 7)
The choice of אִמְרוֹת (*’imrot*, “utterances”) instead of the more prosaic דְּבָרִים (*devarim*, “words”) gives a formal, almost oracular tone; the same term recurs in Psalm 18:31, “אִמְרַת ה׳ צְרוּפָה” – “the word of YHWH is refined.” The metallurgical metaphor is unusually detailed: we have silver (כֶּסֶף), the refining process (צָרוּף, מְזֻקָּק), the vessel (בַּעֲלִיל לָאָרֶץ, probably an earthen crucible set into the ground), and the number of cycles—“sevenfold,” the biblical number of completeness. Elsewhere the same vocabulary is used for God’s testing of people: “צְרַפְתָּנוּ כִּצְרֹף כָּסֶף” – “You refined us as silver is refined” (Ps 66:10). Here the emphasis falls on the *result*: God’s promises are like silver that has been run through the fire until every trace of dross is gone.
The superscription’s enigmatic “עַל־הַשְּׁמִינִית” (“upon the sheminith,” v. 1) may lurk in the background. The word literally means “eighth” and is probably a musical direction (perhaps an eight‑stringed instrument), as Rashi already suggests. Yet it is hard not to notice the interplay: a psalm played “on the eighth” about words refined “sevenfold.” In biblical symbolism, seven marks a full cycle; eight can suggest what lies beyond completion—the circumcision on the eighth day, the festival of *Shemini Atzeret* after seven days of Sukkot. One might say: if human language at its best is seven times purified, the God who stands over it is “eighth,” beyond our cycles.
Verse 8 adds a delicate pronoun puzzle:
> “אַתָּה ה׳ תִּשְׁמְרֵם; תִּצְּרֶנּוּ מִן־הַדּוֹר זּוּ לְעוֹלָם׃”  
> “You, O LORD, will keep *them*;  
> you will guard *him* from this generation forever.”
Whom does God keep and whom does He guard? The plural “them” could refer back to God’s “words” in verse 7 or to the “poor and needy” of verse 6; the singular “him” might be a generic individual within that group. Traditional Jewish commentators mostly take both pronouns to refer to the oppressed: “You will guard the poor,” says Radak, “each and every poor person wherever he may be among the oppressors.” Ibn Ezra suggests the first pronoun points to the divine utterances, which God faithfully keeps, while the second points to the human recipient of those words. The ambiguity is almost programmatic. In Psalm 12, guarding God’s words and guarding God’s people are inseparable acts.
Finally, we reach the disquieting close:
> “סָבִיב רְשָׁעִים יִתְהַלָּכוּן;  
> כְּרֻם זֻלּוּת לִבְנֵי אָדָם׃” (v. 9)  
> “On every side the wicked prowl,  
> while vileness is exalted among the sons of men.”
The verb יִתְהַלָּכוּן (“they walk about”) in its reflexive form suggests restless, self‑directed movement: the wicked are not merely present; they roam. The phrase סָבִיב (“around, all around”) answers our sense that there is no safe direction to turn. The rare noun זֻלּוּת—built from a root meaning “cheap, lightly esteemed”—means “worthlessness, baseness.” When such things are “raised high” (כְּרֻם), when what ought to be despised is on the pedestal, the wicked flourish.
The psalm does not resolve this tension. God has spoken; His words are pure; the poor are under His protection. And yet, “all around the wicked walk.” That is where the congregation singing this psalm must live: between the oracle and its fulfillment, trusting a speech that is “refined sevenfold” in a culture where smooth lies still sell. The psalm’s closing line may be bleak, but it is not hopeless. It is an honest acknowledgement that the corruption of language is not cured overnight—that faithfulness, whether human or divine, must often be kept in the teeth of what everyone around us is saying.
## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use
#### Full psalm
In contemporary Jewish practice, Psalm 12 is recited in its entirety in the Sephardic/Mizrahi (*Edot ha‑Mizrach*) tradition at the evening service of *Shemini Atzeret*, the “eighth day” that closes the Sukkot festival. It is included in a chain of verses and psalms preceding the festival *Amidah*. The congregation thus begins the climactic prayer of the pilgrimage season with David’s cry, “הוֹשִׁיעָה ה׳ כִּי גָמַר חָסִיד” – “Help, O LORD, for the ḥasid has vanished” (v. 2), and with the assurance, “אִמְרוֹת ה׳ אֲמָרוֹת טְהֹרוֹת” – “The words of YHWH are pure words” (v. 7). The numerical echo between *Shemini* (“eighth”) and the superscription “עַל־הַשְּׁמִינִית” has not been lost on later readers.
#### Key verses
Verse 2, “הוֹשִׁיעָה ה׳ כִּי־גָמַר חָסִיד; כִּי־פַסּוּ אֱמוּנִים מִבְּנֵי אָדָם” (“Help, O LORD, for the ḥasid is finished; for the faithful have vanished from the sons of men”), is incorporated into the *Selichot*—the penitential prayers recited in Elul and the Ten Days of Repentance—in many Sephardic rites. A typical sequence weaves it together with other verses of divine mercy and human frailty:
> “כִּי אַתָּה אֲדֹנָי טוֹב וְסַלָּח, וְרַב חֶסֶד לְכׇל קֹרְאֶיךָ;  
> הוֹשִׁיעָה ה׳ כִּי גָמַר חָסִיד כִּי פַסּוּ אֱמוּנִים מִבְּנֵי אָדָם;  
> כִּי אָדָם אֵין צַדִּיק בָּאָרֶץ, אֲשֶׁר יַעֲשֶׂה טוֹב וְלֹא יֶחֱטָא׃”
“For You, Lord, are good and forgiving, and abundant in kindness to all who call upon You (Ps 86:5); help, O LORD, for the pious has ceased… (Ps 12:2); for there is no righteous man on earth who does good and does not sin (Eccl 7:20).” Placed in this chain, our verse becomes a communal confession: we ourselves may be the missing “faithful.”
#### Phrases
The line “אִמְרוֹת ה׳ אֲמָרוֹת טְהוֹרוֹת” (“The words of YHWH are pure words,” v. 7) enters the liturgy through the medieval poem *Shir ha‑Yichud* (“Song of Unity”), recited in some communities on Yom Kippur eve or as a mystical supplement to Shabbat. Describing God’s care for Israel in the wilderness, the poet writes:
> “בַּעֲבוּר יִשְׁמְרוּ חֻקִּים וְתוֹרוֹת,  
> אִמְרוֹת ה׳ אֲמָרוֹת טְהוֹרוֹת.”
“[He sustained them] so that they would keep statutes and laws, the words of YHWH, pure words.” Here Psalm 12’s contrast between duplicitous human speech and pure divine utterance is read as a description of Torah itself.
The commonplace phrase “אִישׁ אֶת־רֵעֵהוּ” (“each man his fellow,” v. 3) reappears homiletically in *Pirkei Avot* 3:2, a tractate traditionally studied on Shabbat afternoons: “שֶׁאִלְמָלֵא מוֹרָאָהּ, אִישׁ אֶת־רֵעֵהוּ חַיִּים בָּלָעוּ” – “were it not for fear of [the government], a man would swallow his fellow alive.” Our psalm’s description of people speaking *shav’* “each to his fellow” becomes, in rabbinic imagination, a portrait of social disintegration that only law and reverence can restrain.
A more allusive use of Psalm 12 appears in some Ashkenazic piyyutim for Yom Kippur, which lament generations “הַמְדַבְּרִים חֲלָקוֹת בְּלֵב” – “who speak smooth things, with a heart [and] a heart,” echoing verse 3’s indictment. On the holiest night of the year, the charge of “double‑hearted” speech is turned inward: we confess that we too have maintained one heart for God and another for convenience.

## Verse-by-Verse Commentary
#### Verse 1
לַמְנַצֵּחַ עַל־הַשְּׁמִינִית; מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד׃  
“To the choirmaster; on the sheminith; a psalm of David.”
The superscription gives us three pieces of information. לַמְנַצֵּחַ (*lamnatzzeach*) marks the poem as entrusted “to the choirmaster,” probably the chief musician responsible for temple performance. מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד (*mizmor le‑David*) attributes the psalm, in the canonical imagination, to David. The crux is “עַל־הַשְּׁמִינִית” (*‘al ha‑sheminith*).
The feminine form שְׁמִינִית comes from “eight” (שְׁמֹנֶה). Rashi reads it straightforwardly as a musical term: “כִּנּוֹר שֶׁל שְׁמוֹנָה נִימִין” – “a lyre of eight strings.” Psalm 6 bears the same direction. Ibn Ezra admits uncertainty, offering that it may denote a “melody” or “style” of composition. Modern scholars usually follow this line: “on the sheminith” likely means “for performance on an eight‑stringed instrument” or “in the lower (eighth) register.”
Radak and Meiri, who refer back to their comments on Psalm 6, take “sheminith” as a technical marker but then read the psalm thematically: a composition about a time “when the wicked prevailed over the poor.” Malbim goes further, glossing our heading as a kind of dedicatory note: “כְּנֶגֶד בַּעֲלֵי לָשׁוֹן בִּזְמַנּוֹ” – “against the masters of the tongue in his time,” signaling that the psalm is about verbal corruption.
An intriguing rabbinic midrash in *Menachot* 43b, preserved by the *Torah Temimah*, links “sheminith” not to music but to circumcision on the eighth day. When David entered the bathhouse and saw himself naked of mitzvot, the story goes, he was distressed until he remembered “the sign of circumcision in his flesh.” Upon exiting, he composed a song “עַל הַשְּׁמִינִית מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד – עַל מִילָה שֶׁנִּתְּנָה בַּשְּׁמִינִי,” “on the sheminith… about circumcision, which is given on the eighth day.” In that homiletical frame, the superscription gestures to the one indelible covenant‑mark on the body, even when other forms of obedience fail.
Placed before a psalm about duplicitous lips and double hearts, this is suggestive. The midrash counterposes an invisible, trustworthy mark in the flesh—circumcision—to the visible but untrustworthy organ of the tongue. You can fake your words; you cannot fake the covenant cut into your body. Even if we do not read that into the peshat, the plain sense, the juxtaposition of “eighth” in the heading and “sevenfold” in verse 7 leaves a faint numerical halo: the psalm moves from a musical “eighth” through a sevenfold purification of speech to the unresolved world of verse 9.
#### Verse 2
הוֹשִׁיעָה ה׳; כִּי־גָמַר חָסִיד; כִּי־פַסּוּ אֱמוּנִים מִבְּנֵי אָדָם׃  
“Help, O LORD! For the ḥasid is finished; for the faithful have vanished from the sons of men.”
The psalm proper opens in the classic tone of lament: an abrupt imperative, הוֹשִׁיעָה ה׳ (“Help, O LORD”), followed by two “for” clauses introduced by כִּי. This double כִּי is structurally important. It does not pile up synonyms; it names two facets of the crisis.
First, “גָמַר חָסִיד” – “the ḥasid is finished.” As BDB notes, גמר in this form means “to come to an end, be finished.” חָסִיד, from חֶסֶד, is the person who practices covenantal kindness. Second, “פַסּוּ אֱמוּנִים מִבְּנֵי אָדָם” – “the *’emunim* have vanished from the sons of men.” פָסּוּ, from a root meaning “to cease, fail,” intensifies the picture. אֱמוּנִים, the plural of an abstract noun tied to the root אמן (“firmness, reliability”), here means “faithful ones,” those whose word and character can be trusted. The Greek translator heard instead an abstraction: “ὀλιγόω ὁ ἀλήθεια ἀπὸ υἱοῦ ἀνθρώπου” – “truth has become scarce among the sons of man.” That is precisely the poet’s experience.
The phrase “מִבְּנֵי אָדָם” (“from the sons of men”) recurs at the psalm’s end (“זֻלּוּת לִבְנֵי אָדָם,” v. 9), forming what literary critics call an *inclusio*, an envelope structure that frames the poem. Here it marks the scope of the problem: this is not a private quarrel but a generational atmosphere.
Hyperbolic as it sounds, the line resonated deeply with rabbinic readers. The Talmud (*Sotah* 48a) uses it to describe spiritual decline after the Temple’s destruction: “משחרב בית המקדש… פסקו אנשי אמנה מישראל, שנאמר: הוֹשִׁיעָה ה׳ כִּי גָמַר חָסִיד.” “Once the Temple was destroyed… people of faith ceased from Israel, as it is said, ‘Help, O LORD, for the ḥasid is finished.’” In *Selichot* the verse is woven into a chain of scripts that confess not only the absence of righteous leaders but our own lack of faithfulness.
Comparatively, this cry stands at the head of a cluster of “speech psalms” (Pss 5, 52, 64) that focus less on physical violence than on what we might call linguistic violence. Here, the disappearance of *ḥasid* and *’emunim* sets up the rest of the poem: when there are no longer people who keep their word, what passes for discourse will be *shav’*—empty, manipulative, deadly.
#### Verse 3
שָׁוְא יְדַבְּרוּ אִישׁ אֶת־רֵעֵהוּ; שְׂפַת חֲלָקוֹת; בְּלֵב וָלֵב יְדַבֵּרוּ׃  
“Emptiness they speak, each to his fellow; smooth‑lipped speech; with heart and heart they speak.”
Here the psalmist moves from general complaint to precise diagnosis. The three cola unfold like a set of X‑rays.
First, “שָׁוְא יְדַבְּרוּ אִישׁ אֶת־רֵעֵהוּ” – “They speak *shav’* each to his fellow.” *Shav’* is a flexible word. It can mean “emptiness, nothingness” (as in “in vain,” לַשָּׁוְא), or “lying, falsehood” (as in “false witness”). Here it likely carries both senses: words void of substance that nevertheless wound. The formula “אִישׁ אֶת־רֵעֵהוּ” (“each to his fellow”) stresses the social dimension. This is not primarily about public rhetoric; it is about the everyday speech that should sustain trust between friends and neighbors. Jeremiah laments a similar breakdown: “אִישׁ מֵרֵעֵהוּ הִשָּׁמֵרוּ… וְאִישׁ בְּרֵעֵהוּ יְהַלֵּכוּ בְּרָכִיל” – “Beware each of his fellow… every friend goes about as a talebearer” (Jer 9:3–4).
Second, “שְׂפַת חֲלָקוֹת” – “smooth lips.” The noun חֲלָקוֹת (“smoothnesses”) comes from חלק, “to be smooth, slippery.” This is a favorite metaphor for deceptive speech. As we saw, Psalm 55:22 says, “חָלְקוּ מַחְמָאֹת פִּיו… וְהֵמָּה פְתִחוֹת” – “his talk was smoother than butter… yet they were drawn swords.” Psalm 73:18 uses the same root metaphorically of the wicked’s fate: “אַךְ בַּחֲלָקוֹת תָּשִׁית לָמוֹ” – “You set them in slippery places.” The image is double‑edged: the speech is enticing and pleasant, but like ice underfoot it leads to a fall—for speaker and hearer alike.
Third, and climactically, “בְּלֵב וָלֵב יְדַבֵּרוּ” – “with heart and heart they speak.” As the concordance shows, this idiom surfaces only here and in 1 Chronicles 12:34, where it is negated: the warriors come to David “לְעָזְרְךָ בְּלֹא־לֵב וָלֵב” – “to help you, not with heart and heart,” that is, with undivided sincerity. Our psalm highlights the opposite: a bifurcated self. On the outside, the lips project one heart; inside lurks another. Rashi captures it with deceptive simplicity: “לי מראים שלום, ויש שנאה טמונה בלבבם” – “To me they show peace, but hatred is hidden in their heart.”
Set against the Shema’s demand to love God “בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ” (“with all your heart,” Deut 6:5), the “double heart” is not merely a psychological state but a spiritual perversion. A person with two hearts cannot sustain fidelity to God or neighbor; everything is divided, provisional, subject to revision depending on advantage.
The pattern of the verse illustrates a common feature of Hebrew poetry: what scholars call “synthetic” or “staircase” parallelism. The second colon (“smooth lips”) picks up and specifies the first (“they speak shav’”), and the third colon (“with heart and heart”) exposes the inner source of the outward behavior. A is true, and what’s more B, and what’s more C. In three short phrases the psalmist has given us a whole anthropology of deceit.
#### Verse 4
יַכְרֵת ה׳ כׇּל־שִׂפְתֵי חֲלָקוֹת; לָשׁוֹן מְדַבֶּרֶת גְּדֹלוֹת׃  
“May the LORD cut off all smooth lips, the tongue that speaks great things.”
Having exposed the pathology, the poet turns to imprecation. The verb יַכְרֵת is a jussive form of כרת, “to cut off,” here meaning “may He cut off.” In legal texts, being “cut off from one’s people” (וְנִכְרְתָה הַנֶּפֶשׁ הַהִוא) is the formula for the severest covenantal sanction. Applied here to “lips” and “tongue,” it functions as a synecdoche, a figure in which a part stands for the whole. To ask that God excise “smooth lips” is to ask that those defined by such speech be removed from the covenant community.
The second half of the verse, “לָשׁוֹן מְדַבֶּרֶת גְּדֹלוֹת,” personifies the tongue. Grammatically it is “a tongue speaking great things,” but the phrase invites us to imagine the tongue as a character with its own agency. “Great things” (גְּדֹלוֹת) here means not noble deeds but boastful, arrogant claims. The Aramaic of Daniel uses a similar expression, “פּוּם מְמַלִּל רַבְרְבָן,” “a mouth speaking great things,” for the blasphemous horn that exalts itself against the Most High (Dan 7:8, 20). Our psalm thus quietly links local social arrogance—people who think no one can call them to account—with cosmic rebellion.
Rabbinic tradition reads this verse through the lens of *lashon hara*. In *Arakhin* 15b, Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina teaches that one cure for speaking evil is intensive Torah study, citing “מַרְפֵּא לָשׁוֹן עֵץ חַיִּים” – “the healing of the tongue is a tree of life” (Prov 15:4). Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina, however, voices a more despairing view: “סיפר [לשון הרע] אין לו תקנה, שכבר כרתו דוד ברוח הקודש שנאמר יַכְרֵת ה׳ כָּל שִׂפְתֵי חֲלָקוֹת” – “One who has spoken [evil speech] has no remedy, for David has already cut him off by the Holy Spirit, as it is said, ‘May the LORD cut off all smooth lips.’” Even if we do not follow this to the letter, it reveals how Psalm 12 became a central text in the Jewish ethic of speech. To undermine another person’s reputation, even with true information, is to take on oneself the status of one cut off.
Theologically, the verse marks an important turning point. Up to now, the psalmist has been diagnosing what “they” do; here he calls God into the field of speech. The one who spoke creation into being is asked to perform an act of de‑creation upon the organs that misuse His gift of language.
#### Verse 5
אֲשֶׁר אָמְרוּ לִלְשֹׁנֵנוּ נַגְבִּיר; שְׂפָתֵינוּ אִתָּנוּ; מִי אָדוֹן לָנוּ׃  
“Those who have said, ‘With our tongue we will prevail; our lips are with us—who is master over us?’”
Verse 5 briefly hands the microphone to the wicked so that they may condemn themselves in their own words. The structure is almost creedal: three compact assertions.
“לִלְשֹׁנֵנוּ נַגְבִּיר” literally means “to our tongue we will make strong.” The preposition ל here is instrumental (“by means of our tongue”) or causal (“because of our tongue”). The Hiphil verb נַגְבִּיר, from גבר (“to be strong, prevail”), is an active, aggressive form: “we will cause to prevail,” “we will gain the upper hand.” Language is their chosen weapon.
“שְׂפָתֵינוּ אִתָּנוּ” – “our lips are with us” – is deceptively simple. Metzudat David glosses: “שְׂפָתֵינוּ בִּרְשׁוּתֵנוּ… נוּכַל לְדַבֵּר בָּהֶם דִּבְרֵי שֶׁקֶר” – “our lips are in our control… we can speak with them lying words.” The phrase “with us” signals autonomy, even impunity: no one else has a claim on what we say. In their own eyes, speech is a purely private possession.
“מִי אָדוֹן לָנוּ?” – “Who is master over us?” The word אָדוֹן (*’adon*) is telling. It is a generic term for a human lord or master, not a divine name. Their question is not narrowly theological (“Is there a God?”) but broadly anti‑authoritarian: no one, divine or human, has the right to restrain what we say. Here again the Talmud in *Arakhin* 15b draws the inference: “כל המספר לשון הרע כאילו כפר בעיקר, שנאמר… מִי אָדוֹן לָנוּ.” “Whoever speaks evil speech is as if he denied the Fundamental Principle, as it is said… ‘Who is master over us?’” If no one can tell me to keep silent, then there is, functionally, no Master.
Psalm 64, another “tongue psalm,” offers a revealing parallel. There the conspirators “יְסַפְּרוּ לִטְמֹן מוֹקְשִׁים; אָמְרוּ מִי יִרְאֶה לָמוֹ” – “talk of laying snares; they say, ‘Who will see us?’” (Ps 64:6). Here they say, “Who is lord over us?”; there, “Who will see us?” In both, the essence of wickedness is a belief in linguistic impunity: no one can restrain our words, and no one can even detect the harm they do.
The progression from verse 3 to verse 5 is instructive. First we see the outer phenomenon: smooth speech, double hearts. Then we hear the inner doctrine: language as an autonomous sphere exempt from accountability. The psalm is not content merely to deplore lying; it exposes the anthropology behind it—a vision of the human self as a sovereign speech‑producer, answerable to no one.
#### Verse 6
מִשֹּׁד עֲנִיִּים מֵאֶנְקַת אֶבְיוֹנִים; עַתָּה אָקוּם יֹאמַר ה׳; אָשִׁית בְּיֵשַׁע יָפִיחַ לוֹ׃  
“Because of the plundering of the poor, because of the groaning of the needy,  
‘Now I will arise,’ says YHWH; ‘I will set him in the safety for which he pants.’”
This verse is the fulcrum on which the psalm turns. Formally, it introduces what biblical scholars call a divine oracle: a direct speech from God introduced by a formula (“says YHWH,” יֹאמַר ה׳). Such oracles are common in the prophets but relatively rare within psalms of lament. Their presence hints at a liturgical setting in which a priest‑prophet, speaking in God’s name, answered the community’s complaint.
The motivations ascribed to God are concrete and social: “מִשֹּׁד עֲנִיִּים” – “from (or because of) the plundering of the poor,” and “מֵאֶנְקַת אֶבְיוֹנִים” – “from the groaning of the needy.” The noun שֹׁד (*shod*) denotes violence, devastation, economic robbery. עֲנִיִּים (*aniyyim*) and אֶבְיוֹנִים (*’evyonim*) are overlapping terms for those without resources or power. We began with the disappearance of “the ḥasid” and “the faithful”; here we see the flip side: those who suffer most from a culture of deceit are the poor, whose lack of leverage makes them easy targets for those with “smooth lips.”
The divine response begins with a time‑marker and a verb: “עַתָּה אָקוּם” – “Now I will arise.” The “now” suggests that God’s patience has reached its limit. The verb קום (“to arise”) is classic theophanic language in the psalms, often in pleas such as “קוּמָה ה׳, הוֹשִׁיעֵנִי” – “Arise, O LORD, save me” (Ps 3:8). Here, uniquely, God announces His own rising.
The last clause is famously difficult: “אָשִׁית בְּיֵשַׁע יָפִיחַ לוֹ.” The root שׁית (*shith*) means “to set, place.” בְּיֵשַׁע is “in salvation, in safety.” So far, “I will place (him) in safety” is reasonably clear. But what of “יָפִיחַ לוֹ”? The root פוח (*puaḥ*) means “to breathe, puff, pant,” and, by metaphor, “to utter.” It is used of false witnesses who “breathe out lies” (מְפִיחַ כְּזָבִים, Prov 6:19; 14:5, 25), and in Habakkuk 2:3, “וְיָפֵחַ לַקֵּץ” – “it pants toward the end,” describing a vision hastening toward fulfillment.
Radak, noting Proverbs 29:8 (“אַנְשֵׁי לָצוֹן יָפִיחוּ קִרְיָה” – “scoffers set a city aflame”), understands יָפִיחַ as “to set traps, inflame,” and takes the clause to mean “I will set the poor in salvation from what [the wicked] ‘breathe out’ against him,” i.e., from their schemes. Ibn Ezra and Rashi incline to “speak, utter”: “I will establish the salvation about which he has been ‘breathing’ (speaking, yearning).” Modern translations often bring in the physical sense: “I will place him in the safety for which he longs (pants).”
We do not need to choose among these nuances; the psalm probably invites all of them. God’s salvation is at once a spoken promise (“breathing out” a word) and a concrete relocation (“I will set him”) into a space of safety that answers the oppressed person’s wordless panting. In a psalm obsessed with destructive language, God’s breath—both as speech and as life‑giving wind—enters as the counterforce.
#### Verse 7
אִמְרוֹת ה׳ אֲמָרוֹת טְהֹרוֹת; כֶּסֶף צָרוּף בַּעֲלִיל לָאָרֶץ; מְזֻקָּק שִׁבְעָתָיִם׃  
“The utterances of YHWH are pure utterances, silver refined in an earthen crucible, purified sevenfold.”
This verse is the psalm’s theological center of gravity. It draws an explicit contrast between the “smooth lips” and “empty talk” of verses 3–5 and the quality of God’s own speech.
The repetition “אִמְרוֹת… אֲמָרוֹת” has the feel of a solemn declaration. אִמְרָה (*’imrah*) is a poetic word for “utterance,” used especially for God’s speech in the psalms and wisdom literature. Psalm 18:31 says, “אִמְרַת ה׳ צְרוּפָה” – “the word of YHWH is refined.” Psalm 119:140 echoes, “צְרוּפָה אִמְרָתְךָ מְאֹד” – “Your word is exceedingly refined.” Our verse elaborates that image in almost technical detail.
“כֶּסֶף צָרוּף” is “refined silver,” the participle צָרוּף (from צרף) denoting metal that has been smelted to remove impurities. The prepositional phrase “בַּעֲלִיל לָאָרֶץ” is difficult. The noun עֲלִיל appears only here and in Ezekiel 24:11. Many modern interpreters, following BDB and archaeological evidence, understand it as a type of earthen crucible or furnace set in the ground. Thus: “silver refined in a crucible on (or of) the earth.” Rashi, more homiletically, takes בַּעֲלִיל as “openly, manifestly,” reading: “like silver refined, visible to all the earth.” The Talmud (Rosh Hashanah 21b) itself pauses over the unusual form and infers from our verse that עֲלִיל means “clearly,” evidence of how closely later Jews read this line.
“מְזֻקָּק שִׁבְעָתָיִם” – “purified sevenfold” – picks up another refining verb, זקק, and adds the number seven. As the concordance shows, “sevenfold” often functions as a symbolic intensifier rather than a literal count: “If anyone kills Cain, sevenfold vengeance shall be taken” (Gen 4:15), “Pay back our neighbors sevenfold for the abuse they hurled at You” (Ps 79:12). When applied to metal, seven rounds in the furnace would indeed produce remarkable purity; but biblically the number also signals completeness, as in the seven days of creation.
Psalm 12 is not alone in comparing God’s word to refined metal. Psalm 66:10 tells Israel, “כִּי בְחַנְתָּנוּ אֱלֹקִים, צְרַפְתָּנוּ כִּצְרֹף כָּסֶף” – “You have tested us, O God, You have refined us as silver is refined.” Proverbs 30:5 says, “כָּל אִמְרַת אֱלוֹקַּ צְרוּפָה” – “Every word of God is refined.” Our psalm adds the vivid picture of the earthen crucible, grounding the metaphor in familiar craft practice.
Against that background, the contrast is sharp. Human words in this psalm are slippery, hollow, self‑serving. God’s words have been through the fire seven times; no duplicity, no hidden heart lurks behind them. The Malbim, reading as a 19th‑century defender of traditional Judaism, presses the point: even the “stories and parables” of Torah are “pure,” he says, not empty fictions like the myths of philosophers. They are “garments” for hidden wisdom, but garments woven without flaw.
This verse has naturally been recruited in liturgy and theology to underwrite the trustworthiness of Torah. In *Shir ha‑Yichud*, the desert generation is said to be sustained “בַּעֲבוּר יִשְׁמְרוּ חֻקִּים וְתוֹרוֹת, אִמְרוֹת ה׳ אֲמָרוֹת טְהוֹרוֹת” – “so that they would keep statutes and laws, the words of YHWH, pure words.” The psalm’s concern with social speech ethics thus becomes, in the hands of tradition, a statement about the nature of revelation itself.
#### Verse 8
אַתָּה ה׳ תִּשְׁמְרֵם; תִּצְּרֶנּוּ מִן־הַדּוֹר זּוּ לְעוֹלָם׃  
“You, O LORD, will keep them; You will guard him from this generation forever.”
This verse gathers up the assurances implicit in the divine oracle and the metaphor of refined speech and turns them into a direct confession of trust. Yet its grammar resists over‑tidy resolution.
The first clause, “אַתָּה ה׳ תִּשְׁמְרֵם,” uses the verb שׁמר (“to keep, guard”) with a third‑person plural suffix: “You, LORD, will keep *them*.” The most natural antecedents are the oppressed of verse 6—“the poor” and “the needy”—and perhaps by extension the “ḥasid” and “faithful” of verse 2, if any remain. Alternatively, as Ibn Ezra hints, “them” could refer back to the “utterances of YHWH” in verse 7: God both speaks pure words and keeps them, in the sense of bringing them to fulfillment.
The second clause shifts unexpectedly to the singular: “תִּצְּרֶנּוּ מִן־הַדּוֹר זּוּ לְעוֹלָם” – “You will guard *him* from this generation forever.” The verb נצר (*natsar*), like שׁמר, means “to guard, watch over”; the two together form a tight, near‑synonymous parallel. Many commentators, including Radak and Metzudat David, resolve the number shift by reading the singular distributively: God keeps the poor as a group and also each individual within that group. “You will guard every poor person,” says Radak, “wherever he is among the oppressors.”
Another possibility is that the singular pronoun reaches back to the “this” of “this generation” (הַדּוֹר זּוּ) and forward to each “him” who resists its norms. Then the sense would be: though the age is characterized by duplicity, God will guard the one who aligns himself with His pure words. The Septuagint, interestingly, smooths the verse to a first‑person plural—“you, Lord, will keep *us* and preserve *us* from this generation”—showing that ancient readers also felt the tug to apply the promise communally.
The demonstrative “זּוּ” in “מִן־הַדּוֹר זּוּ” deserves a moment’s notice. It lends an almost disdainful specificity: *this* generation, the one in which “vileness is exalted” (v. 9). Similar expressions occur in Psalm 24:6 (“זֶה דּוֹר דֹּרְשָׁיו”), “This is the generation of those who seek Him,” and in Deuteronomy’s “דּוֹר עִקֵּשׁ וּפְתַלְתֹּל” (“a crooked and twisted generation,” Deut 32:5). Generations, biblically, are moral as well as chronological categories.
What emerges theologically is a double focus. God’s promise in this psalm is not to whisk the faithful out of a corrupt age but to keep and guard them *within* it. The verbs are ongoing—“You will keep… will guard”—and the horizon is “לְעוֹלָם,” “forever,” which here likely means “for all future time,” not metaphysical eternity. It is a promise of enduring, watchful care for those who cling to words that have been “refined sevenfold” even when everything around them is being debased.
#### Verse 9
סָבִיב רְשָׁעִים יִתְהַלָּכוּן; כְּרֻם זֻלּוּת לִבְנֵי אָדָם׃  
“On every side the wicked roam, when vileness is exalted among the sons of men.”
The psalm ends without a tidy resolution. After the oracle (v. 6), the hymn to pure speech (v. 7), and the confession of trust (v. 8), we might expect a triumphant finale. Instead we are returned to the street‑level view: “סָבִיב רְשָׁעִים יִתְהַלָּכוּן.”
The adverb סָבִיב (“around, all around”) combined with the Hitpael verb יִתְהַלָּכוּן (“they walk about”) creates a picture of ceaseless, self‑propelled motion. The same verb form in Job 1:7 describes Satan “roaming through the earth and walking about in it.” Here, the wicked are like that—never still, constantly circling, seeking opportunities. The line admits the ongoing, dynamic presence of evil even after divine assurance has been given.
The second colon is one of the Bible’s densest. “כְּרֻם זֻלּוּת לִבְנֵי אָדָם” is usually rendered “when vileness is exalted among the sons of men.” זֻלּוּת (*zullut*) is a hapax legomenon, a word that appears only here. Related forms (זלל) mean “to be worthless, despised,” as in Lamentations 1:8, “כָּל מְכַבְּדֶיהָ הִזִּילוּהָ” – “all who honored her, despise her.” So זֻלּוּת is “worthlessness, baseness.” רוּם in the passive (“רֻם”) means “to be lifted up.” The prefixed כ (“כְּרֻם”) can mark a temporal clause, “when,” or a causal one, “because.” Thus, “All around the wicked roam, *when* worthlessness is exalted among humanity,” or, “*because* baseness is lifted up among the sons of men.”
On either reading, the logic is clear: when that which ought to be despised is placed on a pedestal—when shameless disregard for truth is admired as cleverness—the wicked flourish. Radak captures it with his own antithesis: “כְּשֶׁיִּתְרוֹמְמוּ הָרְשָׁעִים, הוּא זֻלּוּת וּשִׁפְלוּת לִבְנֵי אָדָם” – “when the wicked are exalted, it is baseness and lowliness for the sons of men.”
The phrase “לִבְנֵי אָדָם” echoes verse 2, “מִבְּנֵי אָדָם,” completing the inclusio and framing the psalm’s argument. We began with the disappearance of “faithful ones from the sons of men”; we end with “baseness among the sons of men” being lifted high. The community lives between these two observations—and between them, crucially, stands God’s “Now I will arise” and the confession that He will keep and guard.
Rabbinic tradition, characteristically, finds homiletical uses even in this bleak line. In *Berakhot* 6b, the rabbis warn against standing outside a synagogue and praying facing away from it. One who does so is called “wicked,” and they adduce our verse: “סָבִיב רְשָׁעִים יִתְהַלָּכוּן” – “around [the synagogue], the wicked walk.” It is a creative, almost playful application, but it shows how “walking around” the place of worship became, in the rabbinic imagination, a symbol of alienation from the community of the faithful.
A more illuminating canonical parallel comes from Psalm 34, which shares vocabulary and themes with Psalm 12. There we read, “חֹנֶה מַלְאַךְ ה׳ סָבִיב לִירֵאָיו וַיְחַלְּצֵם” – “The angel of YHWH encamps around those who fear Him and delivers them” (Ps 34:8). In Psalm 12, “around” are the wicked who roam; in Psalm 34, “around” are God’s protecting messengers. The two psalms sketch two simultaneous realities: a world where baseness is on parade and the wicked prowl, and a hidden world where the faithful are encircled by an unseen guard.
Psalm 12 refuses to collapse these into one. It lets us hear both: the noise of those who say “our lips are with us; who is master over us?” and the quiet but decisive word of the one who says, “Now I will arise… I will set him in the safety for which he longs.”
