Psalm 1 is not merely the first poem in the Psalter; it is a threshold. The editors placed it where they did to teach us how to walk through the rest of the book. Its six verses sketch a moral map—two paths diverging from the first step—and then trace those paths to their ends. The poem’s simplicity is part of its power: a handful of images and a few favored Hebrew words carve out a landscape of counsel, company, and consequence.

The opening word, `ashrei`—often rendered “happy,” “fortunate,” or “flourishing”—sets the tone. Unlike `barukh` (“blessed be...”), which is a benediction directed to or from God, `ashrei` functions as an exclamation about a person’s condition. The form is plural—“O the happinesses!”—a Hebrew way of speaking about a cluster of goods. That does not mean Psalm 1 celebrates self-made success. Across the Bible `ashrei` can mark the one who trusts or waits for God (Psalm 2:12; Isaiah 56:2). Here, too, “happiness” is tethered to a relation: the ongoing choice to keep company with God’s teaching.

Verse 1 builds the danger in three beats: “who did not walk... did not stand... did not sit.” This is anaphora—the deliberate repetition of a phrase at the start of successive clauses—and it works like footsteps refusing to turn down the wrong road. The nouns ascend as well: counsel (the realm of ideas), way (habitual conduct), seat (belonging). So do the companions: the wicked (`resha‘im`), the sinners (`ḥatta’im`), the scoffers (`letsim`). The line is shrewd about how we change: first we listen, then we loiter, finally we settle in.

The positive counterpoint in verse 2 pivots on pleasure, not bare duty: “But rather, in the teaching of the LORD (`torat YHWH`) is his delight (`ḥefetz`).” The verb “meditates,” `yehgeh`, is onomatopoetic: it can describe a lion’s low growl (Isaiah 31:4) or the murmuring of the heart (Proverbs 15:28). The psalmist imagines a person who mouths Scripture day and night—a merism, the pairing of opposites to suggest wholeness. The teaching is first named as God’s (“the LORD’s teaching”) and then, strikingly, “his teaching” (`be-torato`). Traditional readers already saw what the Hebrew hints: what begins as God’s word, received, becomes internalized, memorized, and woven into one’s speech. Torah moves from the page to the palate.

The most famous image follows: the righteous “is like a tree transplanted (`shatul`) by channels of water (`palgei mayim`).” Two technicalities matter. First, the tree is not wild; it is set by intention. The passive participle `shatul` points to a careful gardener. Divine agency stands behind the flourishing that human choice makes possible. Second, `palgei mayim` are “divisions” of water—irrigation channels or runnels, not a lone river. This is cultivation as much as providence. The tree yields “its fruit in its season,” an important proviso that keeps the “all that he does prospers” from collapsing into a promise of constant harvest. The metaphor echoes widely: Jeremiah 17:7–8 pictures a trustful person as a tree by water that “does not cease to bear fruit,” and Ezekiel 47:12 dreams of a grove with leaves that never wither. Psalm 1’s tree stands in that tradition of rooted vitality.

The wicked’s counter-image arrives curtly: “Not so the wicked! Rather, like chaff (`mots`) which the wind (`ruaḥ`) drives away.” Chaff is the husk and dust that flies off when grain is tossed in the air. The point is not that the wicked are fleeting, but that they lack weight—substance that could resist a real wind. The figure is a biblical commonplace for moral inconsequence (Psalm 35:5; Hosea 13:3; Isaiah 41:15–16). Intriguingly, the ancient Greek translation (the LXX) doubles the negation (“not so the wicked, not so”) and renders “seat of scoffers” in v. 1 as “chair of pestilence,” casting scorn as a contagion that spreads. Whatever the translator had before him, the effect underscores the poem’s social realism: company shapes character.

Verses 5–6 move from threshing floor to courtroom and then to God’s perspective. “Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment.” In biblical legal idiom, to “stand” is to have a case that holds up. Deuteronomy 19:15 speaks of a matter that “stands” (`yakum`) on the testimony of two witnesses; here the wicked “will not stand,” their case collapses. Nor will they enter “the assembly of the righteous.” The word for “assembly,” `‘edah`, is the Pentateuch’s term for the congregation of Israel; Psalm 1 repurposes it as the righteous community. The poem ends with an elegant asymmetry: “For the LORD knows (`yada‘`) the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked perishes.” In Hebrew, `yada‘` often means intimate recognition and care (Exodus 33:12; Amos 3:2; Nahum 1:7). God’s knowing is protective attention, not mere surveillance. Notice that it is the “way” of the wicked that expires, not a direct statement that God destroys them. The path they have chosen proves to be a cul-de-sac. That is moral physics, not mechanical retribution.

Two structural notes seal the frame. First, `derekh`—“way”—appears at the start (v. 1) and the end (v. 6), a classic inclusio: bracketing the poem with the same word to focus our reading. Second, Psalm 1 pairs naturally with Psalm 2 as a twin gate to the Psalter: both mention `ashrei` (Psalm 1:1; 2:12), and Psalm 2 shows the “other path” writ large—the nations plotting against God’s anointed—while ending with “Happy are all who take refuge in him.” The two together teach us to read the Psalms as a school in orientation, not a miscellany of religious moods. The laments and praises to come will be heard inside this moral geography: counsel and company shape character; delight reforms desire; fruit ripens in season; a way may look wide and yet go nowhere.
