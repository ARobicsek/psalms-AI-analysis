## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (8)

1. How does the term 'ashrei' (blessed/happy) function differently from 'baruk' (blessed) and what does this suggest about the psalm's anthropocentric vs. theocentric perspective?
2. What is the significance of the tree being 'planted' (shatūl) rather than naturally growing, and how does this relate to divine agency in righteousness?
3. How does the concept of 'meditation' (hagah) relate to ancient Near Eastern wisdom practices and what does day-and-night study suggest about Torah piety?
4. What is the judicial context implied by 'mishpat' in v. 5 and how does it relate to eschatological vs. historical judgment?
5. How do the social degradation terms (wicked, sinners, scoffers) function as a theological taxonomy of evil?
6. What is the significance of the contrast between individual righteousness (vv. 1-3) and communal separation/assembly (vv. 4-5)?
7. How does the divine 'knowing' (yada') in v. 6 function theologically - as foreknowledge, intimate relationship, or active causation?
8. What role does the natural imagery (tree, streams, chaff, wind) play in suggesting cosmic moral order?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (7)

1. Why does the psalm use 'ashrei' (happiness/blessing) rather than 'baruk' (covenant blessing) and what does this suggest about the psalm's theological perspective?
2. What is the significance of the tree being 'planted' (shatūl) rather than naturally growing - does this imply divine agency in righteousness formation?
3. How does the concept of 'meditation' (hagah) function - is this oral recitation, mental contemplation, or scribal study practice?
4. What is the precise meaning of 'standing in judgment' (yāqūmū ba-mishpāṭ) - legal proceedings, eschatological judgment, or community membership?
5. Why is the final parallelism asymmetrical - God 'knows' the righteous way but the wicked way simply 'perishes'?
6. What does the progression from individual morality (vv.1-2) to cosmic imagery (vv.3-4) to communal consequences (v.5) suggest about the psalm's worldview?
7. How does the divine 'knowing' (yōdēa') function theologically - as foreknowledge, intimate relationship, or active causation?
