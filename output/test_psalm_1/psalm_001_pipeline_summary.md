## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (8)

1. What is the significance of the progressive verb sequence 'walked-stood-sat' in v. 1, and how does it relate to wisdom literature's understanding of moral corruption?
2. How does the phrase 'meditates day and night' connect to other biblical texts about Torah study, and what does הגה specifically denote?
3. What is the agricultural background of trees 'planted by streams of water' in ancient Near Eastern wisdom traditions?
4. How does the 'assembly of the righteous' (עֲדַת צַדִּיקִים) in v. 5 relate to eschatological judgment and community identity?
5. What theological implications arise from YHWH 'knowing' (יוֹדֵעַ) the way of the righteous versus the way of the wicked 'perishing'?
6. How do the perfect and imperfect verb forms throughout the psalm contribute to its temporal perspective on blessing and judgment?
7. In what ways does Psalm 1 function programmatically as an introduction to the entire Psalter's theology and categories?
8. How do the creation imagery and natural metaphors relate to Genesis 1-3 and the broader biblical theology of cosmic order?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (7)

1. Why does the psalm use שָׁתוּל (transplanted) rather than נָטַע (planted) - what theological significance does deliberate relocation have?
2. What is the semantic range of יֶהְגֶּה (meditate/mutter) and does it suggest audible Torah study practices?
3. Why the stark asymmetry between elaborate tree blessing (3 elements) and compressed chaff curse (1 element)?
4. How does the progression walk→stand→sit function psychologically and morally in wisdom literature?
5. What is the relationship between YHWH 'knowing' the righteous way and the wicked way 'perishing' - why no divine agent for destruction?
6. Why three distinct categories of evildoers (wicked, sinners, scoffers) rather than generic opposition?
7. What does עֲדַת צַדִּיקִים (assembly of righteous) suggest about eschatological community formation?
