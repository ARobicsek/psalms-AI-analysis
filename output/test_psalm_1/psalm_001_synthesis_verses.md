# Verse-by-Verse Commentary: Psalm 1

## Verse 1

The psalm opens with *'ashrêy-hā'iysh* (`'ashrēy-hā'iysh`), a striking choice that establishes the entire work's theological perspective. The term *'ashrêy* differs significantly from the more familiar *baruk* (blessed), as the BDB lexicon notes: this word "is always used in the plural" because "man is not pronounced 'happy' for one good which is found in him...but for many good things." Unlike *baruk*, which typically denotes covenant relationship initiated by divine favor, *'ashrêy* describes a state of human flourishing achieved through right choices—immediately signaling that this psalm concerns human agency and moral responsibility rather than divine election.

The verse's architecture reveals sophisticated poetic design through its threefold progression of verbs: *hālakh* (walked), *'āmādh* (stood), *yāshāv* (sat). This ascending sequence depicts increasing intimacy and commitment—from casual movement through temporary positioning to permanent residence. The phonetic pattern reinforces this progression, with the harder consonants of *hālakh* giving way to the softer sounds of *yāshāv*, aurally enacting the seductive slide toward moral compromise.

Equally significant is the corresponding social degradation from *rəshā'îm* (wicked) to *khatā'îm* (sinners) to *lētsîm* (scoffers). The BDB lexicon reveals that *lēts* refers to one who "delights in scorning" and "is incapable of discipline...or rebuke." This represents the final stage of moral corruption—not merely wrongdoing, but the proud rejection of moral categories themselves. Traditional Jewish interpretation, reflected in Rashi's commentary, recognized this progression: "the company of scorners brings one to neglect the study of Torah."

The triple repetition of *lō'* (not) creates emphatic anaphora (`lō' hālakh...lō' 'āmādh...lō' yāshāv`), establishing the psalm's fundamental structure through negation before moving to positive description. This rhetorical strategy mirrors the larger biblical pattern of "turn from evil and do good" (Psalm 34:15), suggesting that moral formation requires both avoidance and active choice.

## Verse 2

The emphatic contrast *kî 'im* (but rather) pivots the psalm from negative prohibitions to positive delight. The choice of *cheftso* over duty language proves crucial—this term denotes pleasure and desire, not grudging compliance. The BDB lexicon shows *chefets* ranging from "delight" to "the good pleasure, will, purpose of Yahweh," suggesting that human desire can align with divine intention through proper orientation.

More intriguing still is the subtle shift within the verse itself from "the teaching of the LORD" (*torah YHWH*) to "his teaching" (*be-torato*). Rashi's astute observation captures the transformation: "In the beginning, it is called the law of the Lord, and after he has toiled to master it, it is called his own Torah." This linguistic movement suggests that authentic engagement with divine instruction leads to personal internalization—the external command becomes internal conviction.

The meditation practice described by *yehgeh* (`yehgeh`) demands careful analysis. The figurative language database reveals this term appears in contexts ranging from the lion's growl (Isaiah 31:4) to the righteous person's wisdom utterance (Psalm 37:30). The common thread involves audible expression—this is not silent contemplation but vocal engagement, likely oral recitation and memorization that characterized ancient pedagogical methods. The phonetic quality of *yehgeh* itself, with its guttural resonance, suggests the murmuring sound of such meditative recitation.

The temporal frame "day and night" (*yomam wa-laylah*) functions as a merism—a figure where opposing elements represent totality. The figurative language database shows this phrase appearing throughout Scripture (Deuteronomy 11:19, Joshua 1:8) to indicate comprehensive life integration. This is not academic study confined to particular hours, but the kind of total immersion that transforms identity. The psalmist envisions a person whose entire existence orbits around divine instruction, making Torah meditation as natural and continuous as breathing.

## Verse 3

The central metaphor emerges with deliberate precision: *we-hāyāh kə-'ēts shātūl* (`wəhāyāh kə'ēts shāthūl`)—"and he shall be like a tree planted." The passive participle *shātūl* proves significant; this is not a naturally occurring tree but one "transplanted," as the BDB lexicon indicates. Divine agency underlies the righteous person's flourishing, even as human choice initiates the process. The figurative language database shows tree imagery throughout Scripture representing stability and blessing (Jeremiah 17:8, Ezekiel 17:22-23), but the planted tree specifically suggests intentional cultivation and care.

The location *'al-palgê-mâyim* (`'al-palghēy-māyim`) employs an unusual plural form. Most Hebrew texts would use the singular *peleg*, but the plural *palgê* suggests multiple water sources—abundant, reliable streams rather than a single channel. This abundance imagery recurs in the promise that "its leaf does not wither" (*we-'ālêhū lō'-yibbōl*). The verb *nābal* typically describes the fading of flowers or withering of leaves (Isaiah 40:7-8), making the negation particularly striking. 

The phrase *'asher piryō yittēn be-'ittō* (`'asher pirywō yitēn bə'ittuwō`)—"which yields its fruit in its season"—introduces the crucial element of divine timing. The BDB shows *'ēt* referring not just to time but to "proper time, season." This suggests the righteous person's productivity follows natural, God-ordained rhythms rather than forced or premature efforts. The comprehensive conclusion *we-khōl 'asher-ya'aśeh yatslîach* promises success in "all that he does"—a sweeping guarantee that encompasses every dimension of life.

The agricultural imagery here reflects ancient Near Eastern wisdom traditions where fertility and prosperity were ultimate blessings, but the psalm transforms these material concerns into spiritual metaphors. The tree's permanent vitality (*lō'-yibbōl*) evokes eschatological hopes found in Ezekiel 47:12, where temple-river trees "bear fruit monthly and their leaves never fade."

## Verse 4

The abrupt reversal *lō'-khēn hārəshā'îm* (`lō'-khēn hārəshā'îm`)—"Not so the wicked!"—creates dramatic contrast through emphatic negation. The Hebrew *lō'-khēn* appears only here in the Psalms, making this rejection particularly forceful. After three verses developing the tree metaphor with patient detail, the psalm shifts to rapid, almost dismissive treatment of wickedness.

The comparison *kî 'im-ka-mōts* (`kiy 'im-kamōts`)—"but like chaff"—draws on universal ancient experience of grain processing. The BDB lexicon defines *mōts* as the worthless byproduct of threshing—the light husks and debris easily separated from valuable grain. The figurative language database reveals this chaff imagery throughout Scripture (Job 21:18, Isaiah 41:15-16, Hosea 13:3), consistently emphasizing worthlessness and vulnerability to judgment.

The participial phrase *'asher-tiddafennū rūach* (`'asher-tidfenuwu rwach`) describes the wind's action with the intensive verb *nādaf*. The BDB shows this term indicating violent scattering or driving away, not gentle breeze but forceful dispersal. The chaff has no weight, no substance, no ability to resist—making this image particularly effective for describing the wicked's ultimate powerlessness.

The agricultural metaphor system now stands complete: righteous as planted tree versus wicked as windblown chaff. Ancient threshing practices involved throwing grain into the air, allowing wind to separate heavy grain from light chaff. The psalm applies this everyday scene to ultimate moral categories—divine judgment operates like natural wind, effortlessly separating substantial from worthless.

The verse's brevity compared to the tree metaphor's elaborate development creates rhetorical effect. The righteous merit extended, loving description; the wicked receive swift, summary dismissal. This proportion itself conveys theological judgment about ultimate reality's character.

## Verse 5

The logical connector *'al-kēn* (`'al-kēn`)—"therefore"—draws explicit consequences from the chaff metaphor. The phrase *lō'-yāqūmū rəshā'îm ba-mishpāt* (`lō'-yāqumwu rəshā'iym bamishpāt`) presents interpretive complexity. The verb *qūm* fundamentally means "stand" or "arise," but its legal contexts suggest multiple possibilities: standing in court as valid witnesses, rising for final judgment, or maintaining position in face of divine scrutiny.

The term *mishpāt* adds further nuance. While often translated "judgment," the BDB lexicon shows meanings ranging from "justice" and "judgment" to "legal case" and "judicial decision." The figurative language database reveals *mishpāt* appearing throughout Scripture in both temporal legal proceedings and eschatological contexts. Traditional Jewish interpretation, as reflected in Radak's commentary, understood this as "the Day of Judgment...the day of death," emphasizing ultimate divine evaluation.

The parallel phrase *we-khattā'îm ba-'adat tsaddîqîm* (`wəkhatā'iym baʿadhath tsadiyqiym`) shifts from judicial to communal imagery. The *'ēdāh* (assembly, congregation) represents the covenant community, both historical Israel and the eschatological gathering of the righteous. The BDB shows *'ēdāh* used for various assemblies, from Israel in the wilderness to heavenly councils (Psalm 82:1).

This verse crystallizes the psalm's binary worldview: wicked and righteous occupy mutually exclusive categories. The wicked cannot "stand" in judgment because they lack substance (like chaff); they cannot join the righteous congregation because they have chosen contrary paths. Yet the language allows for both immediate social consequences—exclusion from covenant community—and ultimate eschatological separation.

The progression from individual morality (verses 1-3) through natural imagery (verse 4) to communal and cosmic consequences reveals the psalm's understanding that personal choices have far-reaching implications. Private moral decisions determine public community membership and ultimate destiny.

## Verse 6

The concluding verse provides theological foundation for the entire contrast through the asymmetrical formula: *kî-yōdēa' YHWH derekh tsaddîqîm* (`kiy-ywōdhēa' yəhōwāh derekh tsadiyqiym`)—"For the LORD knows the way of the righteous." The verb *yāda'* proves crucial, carrying meanings far beyond cognitive awareness. The BDB lexicon shows *yāda'* indicating intimate knowledge, recognition, care, and active involvement. When applied to divine knowledge, it suggests protective oversight and personal relationship.

Radak's commentary captures this nuance: divine knowing means God "looks upon and considers with a view to doing them good." The concordance data confirms this pattern—when Scripture says God "knows" people, it typically indicates special relationship and care (Exodus 33:12, Amos 3:2, Nahum 1:7). The "way" (*derekh*) serves double function: both the righteous person's life-path and God's intimate familiarity with that journey.

The asymmetrical conclusion *we-derekh rəshā'îm tō'vēd* (`wədherekh rəshā'iym tō'vēdh`) provides startling contrast. There is no parallel statement that God "knows" the wicked's destruction; their path simply "perishes" (*'ābad*). This verb appears throughout Scripture describing various forms of loss, destruction, and dissolution (BDB shows meanings from "perish" to "be lost" to "vanish"). The wicked's way leads to dissolution by its own internal logic, without requiring active divine intervention.

This asymmetry reveals profound theological insight: righteousness creates relationship with the divine, while wickedness leads to abandonment and natural consequence. Divine economy is not balanced—God's active involvement flows toward those aligning themselves with divine instruction, while those rejecting it encounter the inherent consequences of their choices.

The inclusio created by *derekh* (way) in both verse 1 and verse 6 provides structural completion while emphasizing the psalm's central concern with life-paths and their ultimate destinations. The journey metaphor that opened with walking, standing, and sitting now concludes with divine knowledge and natural dissolution—suggesting that all human movement occurs within a moral universe where choices have cosmic significance.

The psalm thus establishes a hermeneutical framework that will govern the entire Psalter: every human life represents choice between fundamental orientations toward divine instruction, and these choices determine both present community membership and ultimate destiny. The binary may seem severe, but the psalm presents it as simply reflecting the nature of moral reality itself.
