      "commentary": "The opening 'אַשְׁרֵי' (ashrei) is intriguing - this is happiness/blessedness language rather than covenant blessing (baruk). The triple progression 'walked → stood → sat' with corresponding social degradation 'wicked → sinners → scoffers' creates a sophisticated chiastic pattern. The threefold repetition of 'לֹא' (not) creates strong anaphoric rhythm.",

    "Why is the final parallelism asymmetrical - God 'knows' the righteous way but the wicked way simply 'perishes'?",
    "What does the progression from individual morality (vv.1-2) to cosmic imagery (vv.3-4) to communal consequences (v.5) suggest about the psalm's worldview?",
