# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 1

What works: The draft rightly treats Psalm 1 as a deliberately placed gateway to the Psalter and keeps its eye on the poem’s controlling contrast between the two “ways.” It notes the moral taxonomy in verse 1 (wicked, sinners, scoffers), the onomatopoetic nuance of `hagah` (to murmur/meditate), the horticultural precision of `shatul` (transplanted), and the asymmetry of verse 6 (“the LORD knows” vs. “the way of the wicked perishes”). Several traditional Jewish comments are deftly woven in, and the tree/chaff pairing is clearly explained.

What needs revision: 
- Nuance the claim that `ashrei` (“happy/fortunate”) primarily signals human agency. BDB’s note on the plural form is valuable, but `ashrei` in the Bible often points to the posture of reliance on God (e.g., Psalm 2:12; Isaiah 56:2), not self-willed flourishing. The contrast with `barukh` (a benediction) stands, but the anthropocentric tilt is overstated.
- Tighten the linguistic claims. For example, calling `nadaph` in v. 4 “intensive” without clarifying the verb form risks imprecision; better to note that the form used conveys forceful scattering. 
- Missed opportunities: 
  - The poem’s inclusio (framing) with `derekh` (“way”) in vv. 1 and 6 deserves structural emphasis.
  - Intertexts: Jeremiah 17:7–8’s tree by waters; Joshua 1:8’s “meditate day and night”; Psalm 35:5 and Hosea 13:3 on chaff; Deuteronomy’s “two ways” (5:29–30; 11:28; 30:15).
  - The LXX (ancient Greek translation) twice intensifies v. 4 (“not so the wicked, not so”) and renders “seat of scoffers” as “chair of pestilence,” which—whatever its textual basis—casts scorn as contagious. These are interpretively rich.
  - Sound: the triple `lo’` (“not”) in v. 1 as anaphora (repetition at the start of successive phrases) and the murmuring vowel-play of `yehgeh` (v. 2).
- Define terms for lay readers: anaphora, merism (a pair that suggests a whole), inclusio (framing by repetition), parallelism (paired lines that advance thought), LXX, BDB.
- Balance: the introduction and the verse notes sometimes repeat each other; the revision should let the introduction sketch the big architecture (including Psalm 2 as a companion “gate”) and move detail to verse-level notes.

Figurative language: Good general treatment, but the revision should cite specific biblical parallels (e.g., Ps 35:5; Hos 13:3 for chaff; Jer 17:8; Ezek 47:12 for the evergreen tree; Josh 1:8 for “day and night”), note frequency/patterns briefly, and show how Psalm 1’s usage is distinctive (cultivated channels, not wild streams; the path itself “perishes” in v. 6).
