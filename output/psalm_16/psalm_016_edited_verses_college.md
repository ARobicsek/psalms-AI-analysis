**Verse 1**

מִכְתָּ֥ם לְדָוִ֑ד; שָֽׁמְרֵ֥נִי אֵל, כִּֽי־חָסִ֥יתִי בָֽךְ׃  

“A michtam of David. Guard me, O God, for I have taken refuge in You.”

The heading מִכְתָּם (*mikhtam*) is a technical term that appears only here and in Psalms 56–60. No one knows its original meaning with certainty. The Septuagint (ancient Greek translation) renders it στηλογραφία, “inscription on a pillar,” suggesting a poem meant to endure. Medieval Jewish commentators propose “golden song” (from כֶּתֶם, *ketem*, gold) or “engraved poem” (from כתם, to inscribe). You can keep that in the back of your mind: this psalm is meant as something *precious* and *lasting*.

The first line of actual prayer is beautifully simple:

- שָֽׁמְרֵנִי אֵל — “Guard me, O God.”  
  The short divine name אֵל (*El*) emphasizes God’s raw strength (“Mighty One”).

- כִּֽי־חָסִ֥יתִי בָֽךְ — “for I have taken refuge in You.”  
  The verb חָסָה (*ḥāsāh*) means “to seek refuge, to take shelter.” It’s the word used when God is described as a **refuge**. For example, Psalm 91:2:

  > אֹמַר לַיהוָה: מַחְסִי וּמְצוּדָתִי  
  > “I say of YHWH: my refuge and my fortress.”

There’s a deliberate logic marked by כִּי (“for/because”): *because* I have already taken shelter in You, I now ask You to guard me. Often in the Psalms trust comes *after* deliverance; here trust is the **basis** for the request.

This line gets picked up liturgically: during the Priestly Blessing in Sefardic communities, when the priests say “וְיִשְׁמְרֶךָ” (“and may He guard you”), the congregation answers:

> שָׁמְרֵנִי אֵל כִּי־חָסִיתִי בָךְ  
> “Guard me, O God, for I have taken refuge in You.”

So already in v.1 you have the core posture of the psalm: the speaker doesn’t claim merit, only *dependence*. “I’ve put all my eggs in Your basket; now, please, don’t drop it.”

**Verse 2**

אָמַ֣רְתְּ לַֽיהוָה: אֲדֹנָ֣י אָ֑תָּה; טוֹבָתִ֗י בַּל־עָלֶֽיךָ׃  

“I have said to YHWH: ‘You are my Lord; my good is not beyond You.’”

The verse opens with a bit of drama: אָמַ֣רְתְּ (*amart*, “you [fem.] have said”) — who is the “you”? Many commentators say David is talking to his own **soul**, treating it like a conversation partner. Rashi paraphrases: “You, my soul, should say to YHWH: ‘You are the Master.’”

The line has two parts:

1. **אֲדֹנָ֣י אָ֑תָּה** – “You are my Lord / Master.”  
   Here the name YHWH is followed by אֲדֹנָי (*Adonai*, “my Lord”), stressing God’s authority and the speaker’s willing submission. There’s a progression from v.1’s אֵל (“Mighty God”) to the covenant name יְהוָה to the personal master “my Lord.”

2. **טוֹבָתִ֗י בַּל־עָלֶֽיךָ** – this tiny phrase has generated pages of commentary. Literally: “my good… *bal*… upon You.” Three main readings:

   - “**My good is not apart from You**” – all the good in my life comes through You; there is no “good” for me outside of relationship with You.
   - “**My good does not reach up to You**” – my virtue doesn’t benefit You or obligate You. Radak’s father explains: “The good that I do is not *unto* You; it doesn’t reach You.” This matches Job 22:2–3, where Eliphaz asks, “Can a man be of benefit to God?”
   - “**You are my good; nothing above You**” – You yourself are my supreme good.

All three fit the context, and the ambiguity may be deliberate. Put simply: God is both **source** of all good to the speaker and **beyond** being “paid back” by human actions. That tension — total dependence, yet God’s freedom — underlies the bold confidence later in the psalm. When you get to “YHWH is my portion” (v.5), it’s grounded in this earlier recognition: my “good” is bound up with You, not with my own spiritual résumé.

**Verse 3**

לִקְדוֹשִׁים אֲשֶׁר־בָּאָרֶץ הֵמָּה; וְאַדִּירֵי, כׇּל־חֶפְצִי־בָם׃  

“As for the holy ones who are in the land, they — and the mighty ones — all my delight is in them.”

This is one of the most syntactically awkward lines in the psalm. It starts like a topic (“As for the holy ones in the land…”) and then piles on “they” and “the mighty ones” before arriving at the main clause “all my desire is in them.”

Key words:

- **קְדוֹשִׁים** (*qedoshim*) – “holy ones.” In the Bible this can refer to:
  - God (“the Holy One of Israel”),
  - Angels (“His holy ones,” Psalm 89:6),
  - or humans set apart by God (His people, priests, faithful individuals).

- **אַדִּירֵי** (*adirei*) – “mighty/noble ones.” Elsewhere it can mean nobles, kings, or simply impressive figures.

So who are these people?

1. **Rashi**: the patriarchs and other righteous ancestors buried in the land — the “holy ones…in the earth.” God does good to later generations “for their sake.”

2. **Ibn Ezra and Radak**: the pious people of the psalmist’s own generation. Because I love You, I love those who are devoted to You, and I seek their good.

   Radak: “Those who are ‘mighty’ in heart among people… my delight is to do them good, because they keep Your commandments.”

3. **Malbim**: the “holy ones” are how pagans refer to their gods or semidivine beings. Then v.3 would be an ironic setup leading straight into v.4’s “those who hasten after another [god].”

The rabbinic tradition in **Pirkei Avot 6:10** uses this verse positively for Israel: after saying “the people whom You acquired” (Exod 15:16), it quotes:

> לִקְדוֹשִׁים אֲשֶׁר־בָּאָרֶץ הֵמָּה… כׇּל־חֶפְצִי־בָם׃  
> “the holy ones who are in the land… all my delight is in them.”

That pushes us toward reading v.3 as: *Because I love YHWH, I love His holy people; my desires line up with theirs*. This fits nicely with the inheritance theme: the psalmist doesn’t just choose God; he chooses God’s community, over against the idol‑worshippers of v.4.

**Verse 4**

יִרְבּוּ עַצְּבוֹתָם; אַחֵר מָהָרוּ.  
בַּל־אַסִּיךְ נִסְכֵּיהֶם מִדָּם;  
וּבַל־אֶשָּׂא אֶת־שְׁמוֹתָם עַל־שְׂפָתָי׃  

“Many will be their sorrows, who hurry after another [god].  
I will not pour out their blood‑libations,  
and I will not lift up their names on my lips.”

Here the psalmist draws a sharp boundary.

- **אַחֵר מָהָרוּ** – literally “another they hurried [after].” The missing noun is probably “god”: אֵל אַחֵר. The verb מָהַר (*māhar*) in Qal usually means “to hurry,” but it can also mean “to pay a bride‑price” (מֹהַר), so some read this as “they ‘married’ another god,” echoing the prophets’ metaphor of idolatry as adultery.

- **יִרְבּוּ עַצְּבוֹתָם** – “their *atzavot* will multiply.” עֶצֶב (*etsev*) means both “pain/sorrow” and (in some contexts) “idol” (something shaped). There may be a dark wordplay: the more idols they multiply, the more sorrows they multiply.

- **נִסְכֵּיהֶם מִדָּם** – “their libations of blood.” נֶסֶךְ (*nesekh*) is the standard word for **drink offerings**, usually of wine, poured out on the altar (Num 28–29). Here it’s contaminated with **blood**. This might be:
  - literally blood libations in some pagan rites, or
  - metaphorically “blood‑stained” worship (linked to injustice and violence).

Radak paraphrases: “Far be it from me to pour their libations which are of blood (i.e., like ‘you bring what is stolen’ in Malachi 1:13).” Meiri hears “blood” as a metaphor for robbery and oppression: you don’t want to bring God offerings funded by human suffering.

- **“I will not lift up their names on my lips”** echoes Exodus 23:13:

  > שֵׁם אֱלֹהִים אֲחֵרִים לֹא תַזְכִּירוּ; לֹא יִשָּׁמַע עַל־פִּיךָ׃  
  > “The name of other gods you shall not mention; it shall not be heard on your lips.”

The Talmud (Sanhedrin 60b) uses our phrase *בַּל־אַסִּיךְ נִסְכֵּיהֶם* as a proof‑text that **pouring a libation is itself an act of idolatrous worship**.

So, v.4 is more than “I don’t believe in other gods.” It’s a total quarantine: no participation in their rituals, no invoking their names. In modern terms: the psalmist doesn’t “sample” spiritualities. His loyalty is exclusive, and that exclusivity is the precondition for claiming YHWH as his inheritance in vv.5–6.

**Verse 5**

יְהוָה מְנָת־חֶלְקִי וְכוֹסִי;  
אַתָּה תּוֹמִיךְ גּוֹרָלִי׃  

“YHWH is the portion of my share and my cup;  
You secure my lot.”

This is the theological center of the psalm.

Notice the pile‑up of “portion” language:

- **מְנָת־חֶלְקִי** – literally “the portion of my share.” Both מָנָה (*manāh*) and חֵלֶק (*ḥeleq*) are words for a divided share, whether of land, food, or goods.
- **כּוֹסִי** – “my cup.” In biblical poetry, “cup” often stands for your allotted experience — whether pleasant (“my cup overflows,” Psalm 23:5; “I will lift up the cup of salvations,” Psalm 116:13) or bitter (the “cup of wrath,” Psalm 75:9).
- **גּוֹרָלִי** – “my lot,” the object cast to make decisions or divide land.

The psalmist effectively says: *When the cosmic lots were cast, I didn’t end up with a farm. I ended up with God Himself.*

Classical commentators underscore the totality. Radak: “I have no other portion beside Him… The portion, the inheritance, the cup, and the lot are identical; this is repetition with different words to strengthen the point.”

The second line adds an important nuance:

- **אַתָּה תּוֹמִיךְ גּוֹרָלִי** – “You secure/uphold my lot.” The verb תּוֹמִיךְ (*tomikh*) comes from תמך (*tāmakh*), “to support, hold fast.” It’s not just that God *is* the inheritance; God also **keeps** that inheritance from slipping away. Rashi uses a lovely image: like a father who loves one son especially and places his hand on the best share, guiding him to it.

This verse resonates with other “God as portion” texts:

- Lamentations 3:24 – חֶלְקִי יְהוָה אָמְרָה נַפְשִׁי; עַל־כֵּן אוֹחִיל לוֹ׃  
  “YHWH is my portion, says my soul; therefore I will hope in Him.”

- Psalm 73:26 – צּוּר־לְבָבִי וְחֶלְקִי אֱלֹהִים לְעוֹלָם׃  
  “God is the rock of my heart and my portion forever.”

Psalm 16 is distinctive because it compresses four different inheritance terms into one line. It’s like underlining the sentence three times: *God is what I get, God is what I drink, and God is the “random” lot that — in fact — You Yourself ensured for me.*

**Verse 6**

חֲבָלִים נָפְלוּ־לִי בַּנְּעִמִים;  
אַף־נַחֲלָת שָׁפְרָה עָלָי׃  

“The measuring‑lines have fallen for me in pleasant places;  
yes, my inheritance is beautiful to me.”

Here the land metaphor gets vivid.

- **חֲבָלִים** (*ḥavalim*) – literally “cords, ropes.” In land‑division contexts, these are **measuring lines**. For example, Deuteronomy 32:9 describes Israel as God’s own portion:

  > יַעֲקֹב חֶבֶל נַחֲלָתוֹ׃  
  > “Jacob is the measuring‑line of His inheritance.”

- **נָפְלוּ־לִי** – “have fallen to me.” This is idiom for “came to me by lot” (think of lots “falling”). In Joshua 18–19 the same verb is used of tribal allotments: “the lot *came out* (וַיֵּצֵא) for Benjamin.”

Taken together: the invisible “surveyors’ cords” that mark my territory have landed in the most delightful neighborhood — **בַּנְּעִמִים** (*ban‑ne‘imim*), “in pleasant places.” The root נעם (*n-ʿ-m*) connotes sweetness, charm, agreeableness. It’s used for the “pleasantness” of wisdom’s ways (Proverbs 3:17) and the “beauty of YHWH” in the Temple (Psalm 27:4).

The second line intensifies:

- **נַחֲלָת שָׁפְרָה עָלָי** – “my inheritance is beautiful to me.” שָׁפְרָה (*shafrah*) comes from שָׁפִיר (*shafir*), “beautiful, fair.” Radak notes that people usually envy each other’s inheritance — everyone suspects the other person got the better field. “But not so with me,” he says in paraphrase; “my inheritance is lovely *to me*, and I don’t second‑guess God’s allocation.”

There’s a nice echo with Psalm 16’s neighbors in the canon. Psalm 63:6 says,

> כְּמוֹ חֵלֶב וָדֶשֶׁן תִּשְׂבַּע נַפְשִׁי  
> “My soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness.”

Both psalms use rich physical imagery (“fat food,” “pleasant places”) for a **non‑material satisfaction**: a life rooted in God’s presence. Psalm 16’s point is not “my farmland is great,” but “life with YHWH as my portion feels like having landed the best possible plot.”

**Verse 7**

אֲבָרֵךְ אֶת־יְהוָה אֲשֶׁר יְעָצָנִי;  
אַף־לֵילוֹת יִסְּרוּנִי כִלְיוֹתָי׃  

“I bless YHWH who has counseled me;  
even at night my kidneys instruct me.”

The verb **אֲבָרֵךְ** (*avarekh*) is a cohortative form — a way of saying “I will [indeed] bless,” expressing determination and eagerness. To “bless YHWH” means to **praise** or **thank** Him, not to confer benefit on Him.

Why this blessing? Because He has given “counsel”:

- **אֲשֶׁר יְעָצָנִי** – “who has counseled me.” The root יעץ (*y-ʿ-ts*) is used for wise guidance (cf. Isaiah 40:13: “Who has been His counselor?”). Here it points back especially to vv.5–6: God is the one who guided the poet to choose YHWH as his “portion.”

The second colon shifts from God’s counsel to an internal process:

- **אַף־לֵילוֹת** – “even nights.” The plural suggests a regular pattern: night after night.
- **יִסְּרוּנִי כִלְיוֹתָי** – “my kidneys discipline / instruct me.”

The verb יִסְּרוּנִי (*yisseruni*) comes from יָסַר (*yāsar*), which can mean “to discipline, correct, instruct” (think of “musar,” moral discipline). The **kidneys** (*kilyot*) in biblical thought are not just organs; they’re the metaphorical location of deep thoughts and conscience. Jeremiah 11:20 calls God:

> בֹּחֵן כְּלָיוֹת וָלֵב  
> “tester of kidneys and heart.”

The rabbis picked this up memorably: “the kidneys advise, the heart understands” (Berakhot 61a).

So the picture is: at night, when outward noise dies down, deep inner convictions — planted there by God’s guidance — keep the psalmist on track. Meiri puts it this way: “At the time of solitude, my kidneys instruct me; I examined myself and understood from books.” External Torah, internal conscience, and reflection all work together.

If you’ve ever lain awake replaying a moral decision and feeling that internal “push” to do the right thing, you’ve experienced what this verse is talking about. The psalmist blesses God not only for rescuing him from dangers, but for the *inner moral compass* that keeps him walking the “path of life” (v.11).

**Verse 8**

שִׁוִּיתִי יְהוָה לְנֶגְדִּי תָמִיד;  
כִּי מִימִינִי, בַּל־אֶמּוֹט׃  

“I have set YHWH before me always;  
because He is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken.”

This is one of the classic lines of Jewish spirituality.

The key verb is **שִׁוִּיתִי** (*shivviti*), from שָׁוָה (*shavah*), “to make even, to set, to make equal.” Here it means “I have deliberately placed.” The perfect tense suggests a settled practice: *I have set, and it stays set*.

- **יְהוָה לְנֶגְדִּי** – “YHWH before me.” לְנֶגֶד (*le‑neged*) means “opposite, in front of.” So the image is very concrete: like pinning something right in your line of sight so you can’t ignore it.

- **תָמִיד** – “always, continually.” This adverb is used for the *tamid* offerings and the “eternal” lamp in the Tabernacle. What the sanctuary does with structure (constant sacrifices, constant light), the psalmist does with attention: a constant awareness of God.

The second line gives the reason:

- **כִּי מִימִינִי** – “because [He is] at my right hand.” The right hand is the place of strength, honor, and help. Psalm 121:5: “YHWH is your shade at your right hand.” To have God at your right hand is to have powerful support right where you’re most vulnerable.

- **בַּל־אֶמּוֹט** – “I shall not be shaken.” בַּל (*bal*) is an emphatic “not.” The root מוט (*mût*) means “to totter, slip.” The same idiom appears in Psalm 15:5: “He who does these things shall *not be moved* forever.”

So the logic is:

> Because I have made YHWH my constant focal point,  
> and because He stands as my right‑hand support,  
> I have deep stability.

Jewish practice has taken this very literally. The *Shulchan Aruch* begins: “שִׁוִּיתִי ה’ לְנֶגְדִּי תָמִיד — this is a great principle in the Torah.” Many synagogues display the words שִׁוִּיתִי ה’ לְנֶגְדִּי תָמִיד above the ark. In some Sefardic sidurim, this verse even explains why, during *Tachanun*, some lean slightly on the right — enacting “YHWH is at my right hand.”

Spiritually, you could call this a simple meditation practice: constantly bringing God into the “foreground” of your mental screen, so that decisions, fears, and joys are all processed in that light.

**Verse 9**

לָכֵן שָׂמַח לִבִּי וַיָּגֶל כְּבוֹדִי;  
אַף־בְּשָׂרִי יִשְׁכֹּן לָבֶטַח׃  

“Therefore my heart rejoices, and my glory exults;  
even my flesh dwells in security.”

The opening **לָכֵן** (“therefore”) links this joy directly to v.8. Because God is constantly before me and at my right hand, the result is whole‑person gladness.

We get a three‑part human:

1. **לִבִּי** (*libbi*) – “my heart.” In Hebrew, the heart is not just emotions; it’s also thought and will. A “glad heart” means deep, considered satisfaction.

2. **כְבוֹדִי** (*kevodi*) – “my glory.” What is that? Three main options:

   - **My soul / my honored self** – Radak: “the soul, which is the glory of the body.” This fits parallels like Psalm 7:6, where “my glory” = “my life.”
   - **My liver / inner organs** – some ancient interpreters take it as another internal organ alongside “heart” and “flesh,” in line with Lamentations 2:11 (“my liver is poured out on the earth”).
   - **My tongue** – the Greek translation (and Acts 2:26) render “my tongue exults.” That reading treats “glory” as the organ that gives you honor — your speaking ability.

   Whichever you choose, the idea is that the **inner core** of the person is exulting, not just outward behavior.

3. **בְּשָׂרִי** (*besari*) – “my flesh,” the physical body. It too “dwells in security” (*yishkon lavetach*). The root שׁכן (*sh-k-n*) means “to dwell, settle.” The phrase suggests a settled, un-anxious embodiment.

So the joy flows from inside out: mind/heart → inner self → body. This verse also sets up v.10. Because of this deep trust, even my *flesh* can rest secure — and that spills over into confidence that God won’t abandon me to Sheol.

Midrash (Shocher Tov) even reads this as hinting that David’s body didn’t see decay, but on the peshat (plain sense) level we’re not yet talking resurrection; we’re talking about a present sense of being bodily safe under God’s care.

---

**Verse 10**

כִּי לֹא־תַעֲזֹב נַפְשִׁי לִשְׁאוֹל;  
לֹא־תִתֵּן חֲסִידְךָ לִרְאוֹת שָׁחַת׃  

“For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol;  
You will not let Your faithful one see the Pit.”

Here the psalmist gives the theological reason (“for,” כִּי) behind his joy and bodily security.

Key terms:

- **נַפְשִׁי** (*nafshi*) – “my soul / my life / my self.” נֶפֶשׁ in Hebrew is not a ghostly thing trapped in a body; it’s your living self, the “I” that eats, desires, and speaks.

- **שְׁאוֹל** (*Sheol*) – the underworld / grave. It’s the standard term for the realm of the dead, often pictured as a deep, dark place below (e.g., Psalm 88:4–6).

- **שָׁחַת** (*shaḥat*) – literally “pit,” but also “corruption, decay.” In Job 33:18, “the Pit” is parallel to “death.”

- **חֲסִידְךָ** (*ḥasidkha*) – “Your faithful / devoted one.” A **ḥasid** is someone loyal to the covenant, not just “nice.”

So what exactly is the psalmist expecting? Options:

1. **Rescue from a specific deadly crisis** – “You will not let me die now; You will pull me back from the brink.” Other psalms say similar things metaphorically, e.g. Psalm 30:3: “You brought up my soul from Sheol; You revived me from going down to the Pit.”

2. **General confidence of not dying a premature, violent, God‑forsaken death** – Malbim points this way: the “ḥasid” who lives in loyalty to God can expect a peaceful life course, not being “cut off” early.

3. **Emerging hope that death itself is not the end of relationship with God** – this goes beyond (1) and (2). The line “not abandon my soul to Sheol” suggests that even if the body goes to the grave, the self will not be left there in some final, God‑forsaken way. This is how many later readers (both Jewish and Christian) understood it.

Radak, for example, says: “I know that You will not leave my soul to go down to Sheol with the body, but will raise it to Your glory.” That is already close to a belief in the soul’s immortality.

The New Testament (Acts 2:25–31; 13:35–37) famously applies this verse to Jesus’ resurrection, arguing that David did in fact “see decay,” so the verse must point beyond him. From a Jewish literary perspective, we can simply observe that Psalm 16 is pushing the boundaries of Israel’s early view of death: it imagines an unbroken covenant with God that somehow reaches across the grave.

**Verse 11**

תּוֹדִיעֵנִי אֹרַח חַיִּים;  
שֹׂבַע שְׂמָחוֹת אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ;  
נְעִמֹת בִּימִינְךָ נֶצַח׃  

“You make known to me the path of life;  
fullness of joys is in Your presence;  
delights are in Your right hand forever.”

The psalm’s final verse is a kind of summary in three lines.

1. **“You make known to me the path of life”** – אֹרַח חַיִּים (*’orah ḥayyim*) is wisdom language. Proverbs loves this phrase:

   - Proverbs 10:17 – אֹרַח לְחַיִּים שׁוֹמֵר מוּסָר  
     “The one who keeps discipline is on a path of life.”
   - Proverbs 15:24 – אֹרַח חַיִּים לְמַעְלָה לְמַשְׂכִּיל  
     “The path of life goes upward for the wise.”

   In Proverbs, the “path of life” is primarily an **ethical way of living** that leads away from destruction. Psalm 16 takes that image and prays: You, God, are the one who *teaches* me that path.

2. **“Fullness of joys is in Your presence”** – שֹׂבַע שְׂמָחוֹת (*sovaʿ semaḥot*) literally “satiation of joys.” This isn’t a momentary high; it’s being **filled up** with joy, like being completely full after a feast. And it is “אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ” — literally “with Your face,” i.e., **in Your presence**. Being face‑to‑face with God, in biblical imagery, is the ultimate blessing (compare the priestly blessing: “may YHWH make His face shine upon you”).

3. **“Delights are in Your right hand forever”** – נְעִמוֹת (*ne‘imot*) are “pleasant things, delights,” from the same root נעם as “pleasant places” (v.6). The “right hand” is again the place of honor and power. To be at someone’s right hand is to share in their status and security.

   - And it lasts **נֶצַח** (*netzach*). The word can mean “forever, perpetuity,” and in some contexts “splendor / eminence.” Here it clearly signals an **unending** state.

So the trajectory completes:

- God has already **taught** me a way of life.
- That way keeps me close to His **face** now.
- Ultimately, it leads to **endless delight** in His presence.

Notice how this answers the fear in v.10: instead of “seeing the Pit,” the psalmist expects to see God’s face; instead of being left in Sheol, he anticipates “fullness of joys… forever.” However we fill in the metaphysics, the emotional energy is clear: for this poet, *the real inheritance is not land, not even long earthly life, but unbroken joy in the presence of YHWH*.
