    "macro_questions": [
      "What is the syntactic relationship and correct interpretation of vv. 3-4? Are the 'holy ones in the land' faithful Israelites the psalmist admires, or pagan deities/devotees? How does the grammar of v. 3b ('all my desire concerning them') connect to v. 4a?",
      "How does the land inheritance terminology (חֶלֶק, גּוֹרָל, נַחֲלָה, חֲבָלִים) function when applied to God Himself? What are the Pentateuchal parallels for Levites receiving YHWH as their inheritance (Num 18:20; Deut 10:9, 18:1-2), and how does this psalm democratize that concept?",
      "What is the precise meaning of טוֹבָתִי בַּל־עָלֶיךָ in v. 2? Does it mean 'my good is not apart from You' (NJPS), 'You are my good, nothing above You,' or 'my good does not reach up to You' (acknowledging human inability to benefit God, cf. Job 22:2-3)?",
      "What is the significance of כִלְיוֹת ('kidneys') instructing the psalmist at night (v. 7)? How does this relate to other biblical references to kidneys as the seat of conscience/testing (Pss 7:10, 26:2; Jer 11:20, 17:10)?",
      "How should v. 10's confidence about Sheol/Pit be interpreted? Is this (a) protection from premature/violent death, (b) hope for resurrection, (c) assurance of ongoing communion with God transcending death, or (d) simply metaphorical language for deliverance from danger? What are the comparative data from other Psalms (Pss 30:3, 49:15, 73:23-26)?",
      "What is the force and aspect of שִׁוִּיתִי ('I have set/placed') YHWH before me (v. 8)? Is this a completed decisive act, or continuous practice? How does this verb choice shape the theology of intentional divine orientation?",
      "What does כָּבוֹד ('glory') refer to in v. 9? Is it the liver (paralleling heart and flesh as body parts), the soul/self, or God's glory? What is the triadic structure of heart-glory-flesh trying to communicate about human wholeness?",
      "How does נֶֽצַח (v. 11) function semantically—'forever,' 'perpetuity,' 'victory,' 'endurance'? Does it suggest eternal life in God's presence, or enduring joy in this life?",
      "What is the 'path of life' (אֹרַח חַיִּים, v. 11)? Is this wisdom language (cf. Prov 2:19, 5:6, 10:17), cultic instruction, or something more eschatological? How does it relate to ANE journey-of-life metaphors?",
      "What is the meaning and function of the 'michtam' (מִכְתָּם) designation? Does etymology from כתם ('gold'), כתם ('inscription'), or כפר ('atone') illuminate the psalm's use or original setting?"
    ],
    "micro_questions": [
      "What is the exact syntactic and semantic sense of טוֹבָתִי בַּל־עָלֶיךָ in v.2? How does this phrase establish the theological foundation for vv.5-6's inheritance language?",
      "Who are the קְדוֹשִׁים and אַדִּירֵי in v.3, and how does the ambiguous phrase כׇּל־חֶפְצִי־בָם relate syntactically to v.4's clear rejection? Is the ambiguity intentional?",
      "How does the concentration of land-inheritance terminology in vv.5-6 (מְנָת, חֵלֶק, כּוֹס, גּוֹרָל, חֲבָלִים, נַחֲלָה) function as theological metaphor? What is gained by applying territorial language to God Himself?",
      "Why do the kidneys (כִלְיוֹתָי) instruct the psalmist at night (v.7) rather than the heart? What is the anthropological and theological significance of this visceral internal guidance?",
      "What is the referent of כָּבוֹד in v.9 - liver (parallel organ to heart/flesh), soul/self, or something else? How does the LXX's 'tongue' interpretation change the meaning?",
      "How should v.10's confidence about Sheol/Pit be interpreted in its historical context - as protection from premature death, nascent resurrection hope, ongoing communion transcending death, or metaphorical deliverance language? How does this compare to Psalms 49:15 and 73:23-26?",
      "What is the semantic range and force of נֶצַח in v.11 - perpetuity, eternity, victory, or endurance? How does the final word choice shape the psalm's eschatological trajectory?",
      "How does the right hand inclusio (vv.8, 11) function structurally and theologically - what is the progression from God at the psalmist's right hand to delights in God's right hand?",
      "What is the relationship between the 'path of life' (אֹרַח חַיִּים, v.11) and wisdom literature? Is this temporal guidance through earthly life or eschatological trajectory toward eternal life?",
      "What does the michtam (מִכְתָּם) superscription signify, and how might its uncertain etymology (gold? inscription? atonement?) inform the psalm's function or theological emphasis?"
