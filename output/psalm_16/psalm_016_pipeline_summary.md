## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (10)

1. What is the syntactic relationship and correct interpretation of vv. 3-4? Are the 'holy ones in the land' faithful Israelites the psalmist admires, or pagan deities/devotees? How does the grammar of v. 3b ('all my desire concerning them') connect to v. 4a?
2. How does the land inheritance terminology (חֶלֶק, גּוֹרָל, נַחֲלָה, חֲבָלִים) function when applied to God Himself? What are the Pentateuchal parallels for Levites receiving YHWH as their inheritance (Num 18:20; Deut 10:9, 18:1-2), and how does this psalm democratize that concept?
3. What is the precise meaning of טוֹבָתִי בַּל־עָלֶיךָ in v. 2? Does it mean 'my good is not apart from You' (NJPS), 'You are my good, nothing above You,' or 'my good does not reach up to You' (acknowledging human inability to benefit God, cf. Job 22:2-3)?
4. What is the significance of כִלְיוֹת ('kidneys') instructing the psalmist at night (v. 7)? How does this relate to other biblical references to kidneys as the seat of conscience/testing (Pss 7:10, 26:2; Jer 11:20, 17:10)?
5. How should v. 10's confidence about Sheol/Pit be interpreted? Is this (a) protection from premature/violent death, (b) hope for resurrection, (c) assurance of ongoing communion with God transcending death, or (d) simply metaphorical language for deliverance from danger? What are the comparative data from other Psalms (Pss 30:3, 49:15, 73:23-26)?
6. What is the force and aspect of שִׁוִּיתִי ('I have set/placed') YHWH before me (v. 8)? Is this a completed decisive act, or continuous practice? How does this verb choice shape the theology of intentional divine orientation?
7. What does כָּבוֹד ('glory') refer to in v. 9? Is it the liver (paralleling heart and flesh as body parts), the soul/self, or God's glory? What is the triadic structure of heart-glory-flesh trying to communicate about human wholeness?
8. How does נֶֽצַח (v. 11) function semantically—'forever,' 'perpetuity,' 'victory,' 'endurance'? Does it suggest eternal life in God's presence, or enduring joy in this life?
9. What is the 'path of life' (אֹרַח חַיִּים, v. 11)? Is this wisdom language (cf. Prov 2:19, 5:6, 10:17), cultic instruction, or something more eschatological? How does it relate to ANE journey-of-life metaphors?
10. What is the meaning and function of the 'michtam' (מִכְתָּם) designation? Does etymology from כתם ('gold'), כתם ('inscription'), or כפר ('atone') illuminate the psalm's use or original setting?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (13)

1. What is the precise syntactic function and meaning of טוֹבָתִי בַּל־עָלֶיךָ in v.2 - three competing interpretations with vastly different theologies ('my good not apart from You' vs. 'my good doesn't reach You' vs. 'You are my good, none above')?
2. Who are the קְדוֹשִׁים (holy ones) in v.3 - faithful Israelites the psalmist admires, or pagan deities/devotees setting up contrast with v.4? How does the syntax of v.3b connect to v.4a?
3. Why the unprecedented density of land inheritance terminology in vv.5-6 (portion, share, cup, lot, measuring lines, estate) - is this democratization of Levitical 'YHWH as inheritance' theology (Num 18:20), and what theological work does this semantic saturation accomplish?
4. What does כְּבוֹדִי (glory) refer to in v.9 - liver (as LXX 'tongue' suggests body part), soul/self, personal honor, or something else? What is the logic of the heart-glory-flesh triad?
5. How should the confidence about Sheol in v.10 be interpreted - protection from premature death, hope for resurrection, assurance of communion transcending death, or metaphorical deliverance language? What are the implications for dating and theology?
6. What is the force and aspect of שִׁוִּיתִי ('I have set') YHWH before me in v.8 - a completed decisive act, continuous practice, or something else? How does this verb choice shape the psalm's theology of intentional divine orientation?
7. Why do the kidneys (כִלְיוֹת) instruct the psalmist at night in v.7 - is this literal dream oracles, meditative reflection, or metaphor for conscience? How does this relate to other kidney-testing texts (Pss 7:10, 26:2; Jer 11:20, 17:10)?
8. What does נֶֽצַח (forever) mean in v.11 - eternal life in God's presence, enduring joy in this life, victory, or something else? How does this word's semantic range affect interpretation?
9. What are 'blood libations' (נִסְכֵּיהֶם מִדָּם) in v.4 - human sacrifice, animal blood offerings, or metaphorical for idolatry? Why this specific cultic detail in contrast to 'my cup' (v.5)?
10. How does the 'path of life' (אֹרַח חַיִּים) in v.11 function - wisdom instruction (Proverbs parallels), cultic guidance, eschatological journey, or all three? What is its relationship to ANE journey-of-life metaphors?
11. What is the meaning and function of מִכְתָּם (michtam) - does etymology from כתם ('gold'), כתם ('inscription'), or כפר ('atone') illuminate the psalm's use or original Sitz im Leben?
12. Why does אַחֵר (another god) in v.4 remain unnamed - is this damnatio memoriae, legal prohibition, or rhetorical strategy? What does elliptical reference accomplish?
13. How does the right hand inclusio work spatially and theologically - in v.8 God is 'at my right hand' (protecting), in v.11 delights are 'in Your right hand' (psalmist's location). What progression does this spatial shift indicate?
