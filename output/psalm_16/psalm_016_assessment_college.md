# Editorial Assessment (College Edition) - Psalm 16

The existing introduction and commentary do a lot of things well. They’re textually grounded, bring in excellent classical sources (Rashi, Radak, Malbim, Meiri), and notice many genuinely interesting features: the “inheritance cluster” in vv.5–6, the kidneys at night (v.7), the force of שִׁוִּיתִי in v.8, and the death / Sheol language in vv.9–11. For a graduate seminar, this would be a strong first draft.

But for a first‑year college student, it has some problems:

- **Tone and density**: It reads like a commentary article, not like someone talking to you over coffee. Paragraphs are long, the prose is heavy, and key ideas get buried under piles of quotations.
- **Jargon**: Terms like “anthropology,” “semantic density,” “Levitical exception,” “synecdochically,” and “cadastral system” appear with no simple explanation. A sharp 18‑year‑old can handle the concepts, but the writing needs to walk them in more gently.
- **Structure & redundancy**: The introduction circles the same ideas (inheritance language, Levitical model, divine presence) several times without a crisp “this psalm is about X, and here’s how it unfolds.” Verse commentary repeats large chunks of the intro.
- **Incomplete / uneven**: Commentary breaks off mid‑verse in places and never treats vv.10–11. Some great resources (Torah Temimah on idolatry, liturgical uses) are underused or buried.
- **Missed “why it matters” moments**: The draft often tells you what the Hebrew can mean, but not why that choice of word or image is poetically powerful or theologically daring.

What’s needed: a cleaner macro‑map of the psalm; lighter, more conversational prose; clear definitions of every technical term; more frequent, shorter Hebrew+English examples; and a fuller use of liturgical and rabbinic material to show how later Jews “heard” this psalm. The goal is to keep all the depth, but make the learning curve feel exciting rather than exhausting.
