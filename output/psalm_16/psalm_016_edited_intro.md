Psalm 16 is a modest-looking poem that quietly upends an entire worldview. On the surface it is a “psalm of trust,” a speaker asking God for protection and ending in confidence and joy. But if you follow its internal logic, the psalm does something more radical. It takes the central good of Israel’s story—land, the promised inheritance—and relocates it. The gift is no longer territory. The gift is God.

The superscription already hints that this is a psalm meant to endure. It is called a *miktam* (מִכְתָּם), a term that appears only in a handful of Davidic psalms (16, 56–60) and whose precise meaning has been lost. The ancient Greek translators gave up on etymology and rendered it στηλογραφία, “an inscription on a stele,” as if to say: this is something worth carving in stone. Medieval Jews guessed in various directions. Some linked it to כֶּתֶם, “fine gold,” making it a “golden poem.” Others heard כָּתַם, “to engrave,” or even כִּפֶּר, “to atone,” imagining a liturgical function. We cannot be sure. But the instinct of permanence fits. This is a poem about what, in the end, truly lasts.

The opening line sets the tone and the logic:  

> מִכְתָּם לְדָוִד; שׇֽׁמְרֵנִי אֵל, כִּֽי־חָסִ֥יתִי בָךְ׃  
> “A *miktam* of David. Guard me, O God, for I have taken refuge in You.”

The verb “I have taken refuge” (חָסִיתִי) is in a perfect form that implies a settled decision rather than a passing impulse. The plea “guard me” rests *on* that decision: because I have thrown in my lot with You alone, You are the one I can ask to protect me. Already in v. 1 there is a trade: the speaker relinquishes other shelters and appeals to God as the only refuge.

Verse 2 sharpens that trade in an austere, difficult phrase.  

> אָמַ֣רְתְּ לַֽיהוָה, אֲדֹנָי אָתָּה; טוֹבָתִי בַּל־עָלֶיךָ׃  
> “I say to YHWH, ‘You are my Lord; my good is not beyond You.’”

The last clause, טוֹבָתִי בַּל־עָלֶיךָ, has resisted neat translation for centuries. Does it mean “I have no good apart from You”—that every benefit in life is dependent on God? Or “my goodness does not reach You”—that human virtue adds nothing to God, as in Job’s protest: “If you are righteous, what do you give Him?” (Job 35:7)? Radak preserves both possibilities. One reading: “The good You do for me is not imposed on You as an obligation…all is grace from You.” Another: “The good that I do is not upon You,” that is, cannot benefit God. These are not mutually exclusive. Together they make a double claim: God is the sole source of my good, and even my best actions confer nothing on God. That combination—radical dependence and divine freedom—will underwrite the rest of the psalm.

Verses 3–4 move horizontally, from God to human allegiances, and do so through a famously obscure line:

> לִקְדוֹשִׁים אֲשֶׁר־בָּאָרֶץ הֵמָּה, וְאַדִּירֵי כׇּל־חֶפְצִי־בָם׃  
> “As for the holy ones who are in the land, and the mighty ones— all my desire is in them.”

Who are these “holy ones” (קְדוֹשִׁים) and “mighty ones” (אַדִּירִים)? Traditional Jewish interpreters mostly see here the righteous in Israel, either the ancestors buried in the land or the pious of the present. Rashi: “For the sake of the holy ones who are buried in the earth…they are the mighty ones in whom is all my delight.” Radak: “Because I love You, I love those who are holy, and I do good to them.” The Mishnah in *Avot* 6:10 quotes this verse in a list of God’s “acquisitions” to prove Israel’s special status: “לִקְדוֹשִׁים אֲשֶׁר־בָּאָרֶץ הֵמָּה… – the holy ones who are in the land, they are all my delight.”

Some moderns, noticing that in Ugaritic myth the *qdšm* are divine beings, have wondered if our verse speaks ironically of pagan “holy ones” whom others revere. But the next verse, with its unambiguous rejection of other gods, makes that unlikely. More persuasive is a simple movement: v. 2 affirms exclusive loyalty to YHWH; v. 3 then extends that loyalty to God’s friends on earth; v. 4, by contrast, turns away from other deities and their devotees.

That contrast is stated with almost legal firmness:

> יִרְבּוּ עַצְּבוֹתָם; אַחֵר מָהָרוּ.  
> בַּל־אַסִּיךְ נִסְכֵּיהֶם מִדָּם; וּבַל־אֶשָּׂא אֶת־שְׁמוֹתָם עַל־שְׂפָתָי׃  
> “Many will be the pains of those who hasten after another [god].  
> I will not pour their libations of blood; I will not lift up their names on my lips.”

The double *bal* (“not at all”) draws a sharp boundary: neither participation in their worship (“libations of blood”) nor even pronouncing their names. The Torah Temimah notices that later halakhah takes this language quite literally. The Talmud (Sanhedrin 60b) derives from “I will not pour their libations” that pouring wine or other liquids for an idol counts as idolatrous service; Exodus 23:13’s “the names of other gods you shall not mention” becomes a legal ban on even casual invocation. What is poetry here hardens into law.

Verses 5–6 form the psalm’s hinge and its boldest claim. Land-law vocabulary suddenly rushes in:

> יְהוָה מְנָת־חֶלְקִי וְכוֹסִי; אַתָּה תּוֹמִיךְ גּוֹרָלִי׃  
> חֲבָלִים נָפְלוּ־לִי בַּנְּעִמִים; אַף־נַחֲלָת שָׁפְרָה עָלָי׃  
> “YHWH is the portion of my share and my cup; You hold fast my lot.  
> The measuring-lines have fallen for me in pleasant [places]; yes, my inheritance is lovely to me.”

*Portion* (מְנָת), *share* (חֵלֶק), *lot* (גּוֹרָל), *measuring-lines* (חֲבָלִים), and *inheritance* (נַחֲלָה) all belong to the technical language of dividing up Canaan in Joshua 13–21. When Joshua casts lots and draws boundary lines, these are the words the text uses. But here the “portion” is not a tract of land. It is YHWH.

This has a clear biblical precedent. The tribe of Levi, unlike the other tribes, was not given a territorial inheritance. Instead God says to Aaron: “You shall have no inheritance in their land… I am your portion (חֶלְקְךָ) and your inheritance (נַחֲלָתְךָ)” (Numbers 18:20). Deuteronomy repeats: “Therefore Levi has no portion or inheritance with his brothers; YHWH is his inheritance” (Deut. 10:9). Psalm 16 takes that priestly privilege and universalizes it: any worshiper who speaks like this can claim, “YHWH is *my* portion.”

That metaphor does real work. When you say “The LORD is my portion,” as Lamentations also does—“חֶלְקִי יְהוָה, אָמְרָה נַפְשִׁי” (“‘The LORD is my portion,’ says my soul,” Lam. 3:24)—you are not making a pious flourish. You are redefining security. Land, in ancient Israel, meant livelihood, continuity, status. To move that cluster of meanings onto God is to locate your future in a relationship rather than in property. The psalm’s second colon in v. 5, “You hold fast my lot” (תּוֹמִיךְ גּוֹרָלִי), underlines that shift: God is not just the “plot”; God is the one who keeps your fate from being taken away.

Verse 6 then completes the picture with a surveyor’s image. The “lines” are the ropes used to demarcate fields; “have fallen” is the stock idiom for how a lot comes out. In Joshua, the lot might land you on rocky hillsides; here they fall “in pleasant places” (בַּנְּעִמִים). Radak spiritualizes this without losing the concreteness: the pleasant places are “good and right knowledge,” a life shaped by God’s teaching. The point is contentment: unlike those who “hasten after another god,” the speaker can say without envy, “my inheritance is beautiful to me.”

From there the psalm turns inward.  

> אֲבָרֵךְ אֶת־יְהוָה אֲשֶׁר יְעָצָנִי; אַף־לֵילוֹת יִסְּרוּנִי כִלְיוֹתָי׃  
> “I bless YHWH who has counseled me; even at nights my kidneys instruct me.”

Here the “inheritance” becomes guidance. God has provided counsel—through Torah, prophets, wisdom—and that counsel has sunk so deep that it operates as conscience. In biblical anthropology the *kidneys* (כִלְיוֹת) are not an oddity; they are one of the seats of inner knowing. “YHWH tests the kidneys and the heart,” says Jeremiah (Jer. 17:10). The sages later put it this way: “The kidneys counsel, the heart understands” (Berakhot 61a). Night, when external busyness stops, is the prime time for this inner pedagogy. Meiri nicely glosses: “At night, which is the time of solitude, my kidneys instruct me—meaning, I investigated by myself and understood through books.” Divine counsel works both through revelation and through this cultivated moral sense.

Verse 8 gives us the psalm’s best-known line:

> שִׁוִּיתִי יְהוָה לְנֶגְדִּי תָמִיד; כִּי מִימִינִי בַּל־אֶמּוֹט׃  
> “I have set YHWH before me always; because He is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken.”

The verb שִׁוִּיתִי means “I have set, placed,” but also “I have made equal.” It suggests a deliberate, sustained act: I position God in my field of vision; I weigh God’s will against my own desires and give it equal or greater weight. The adverb תָמִיד (“continually”) is used elsewhere for the *tamid*, the regular temple offering; here the constant “service” is mental. Maimonides, thinking of this verse, describes the highest spiritual state as one in which a person “walks before God” at all times, never losing awareness of the divine presence.

Jewish practice took the verse quite literally. The Shulchan Arukh calls “שִׁוִּיתִי יְהוָה לְנֶגְדִּי תָמִיד” “a great principle in the Torah,” and traditional synagogues often inscribe it above the ark. The Talmud (Sanhedrin 21b) even uses it, somewhat playfully, to justify the king’s portable Torah scroll: he ties it to his arm “like an amulet,” in light of “I have set YHWH before me always.” The psalm’s inner orientation becomes a physical posture.

With that orientation in place, the psalm can speak of joy and death in the same breath:

> לָכֵן שָׂמַח לִבִּי וַיָּגֶל כְּבוֹדִי; אַף־בְּשָׂרִי יִשְׁכֹּן לָבֶטַח׃  
> “Therefore my heart rejoices, and my glory exults; even my flesh dwells secure.”

The “therefore” reaches back to v. 8: because God is constantly “at my right hand,” inner and outer life can rest. The triad “heart–glory–flesh” sketches a whole person. The “heart” (לֵב) in Hebrew is the seat of thought and will. The “glory” (כָּבוֹדִי) is debated. The Greek translators rendered it “my tongue,” and Acts 2 follows that reading. Many medieval Jews, including Radak, see it as the *soul*, “the glory of the body,” the animating life. Others think of the liver, another internal organ. However we decide, the parallelism—heart, kavod, flesh—moves from inner intention to the body’s most honored part to bodily existence as a whole, all participating in joy.

What permits such confidence is the next, daring claim:

> כִּי לֹא־תַעֲזֹב נַפְשִׁי לִשְׁאוֹל; לֹא־תִתֵּן חֲסִידְךָ לִרְאוֹת שָׁחַת׃  
> “For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol; You will not let Your faithful one see the Pit.”

“Sheol” (שְׁאוֹל) in the Hebrew Bible is the shadowy realm of the dead, the grave-world. “Pit” (שַׁחַת) is a poetic near-synonym. At minimum, the psalmist expects preservation from a dishonorable, early death; the “faithful one” (חֲסִידְךָ) will not see his life drop into a ruinous abyss. But the verse reaches beyond mere longevity. Other psalms speak in similar terms: “But God will redeem my soul from the hand of Sheol” (אַךְ־אֱלֹהִים יִפְדֶּה נַפְשִׁי מִיַּד שְׁאוֹל, Ps. 49:16), and “Afterwards You will take me with glory” (וְאַחַר כָּבוֹד תִּקָּחֵנִי, Ps. 73:24). Psalm 16 stands near the frontier of biblical thinking about death, not quite formulating a doctrine of bodily resurrection but insisting that covenant with God is stronger than the grave.

Early Christianity seized on the Greek version of v. 10, which says God will not let his “holy one see *decay*” (διαφθορά), and applied it to Jesus in Acts 2 and 13. Jewish tradition went a different way. The Torah Temimah cites a Talmudic line (Yoma 87a): “Whoever brings merit to the many, sin does not come through his hand,” and links it to our verse: “so that he not be in Gehenna while his disciples are in Eden—for it is written, ‘You will not abandon my soul to Sheol; You will not give Your faithful one to see the Pit.’” In that reading, the verse is about moral integrity: God will not let a truly faithful life end in disgrace.

The final verse gathers all these threads and gives them a name:

> תּוֹדִיעֵנִי אֹרַח חַיִּים; שֹׂבַע שְׂמָחוֹת אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ; נְעִמוֹת בִּימִינְךָ נֶצַח׃  
> “You make known to me the path of life; satiety of joys is in Your presence; delights are at Your right hand forever.”

The “path of life” (*orach chayyim*) echoes wisdom sayings: “The path of life leads upward for the prudent, to avoid Sheol below” (אֹרַח חַיִּים לְמַעְלָה לְמַשְׂכִּיל, Prov. 15:24). But unlike in Proverbs, where the sage discovers that path through observation, here the path is “made known” by God. It culminates not in success or even virtue but in encounter: “Your face” (פָּנֶיךָ), “Your right hand” (יְמִינְךָ). The closing word, נֶצַח, can mean “perpetuity, forever.” It is the same term Isaiah uses when he says Edom’s smoke will rise “לְנֶצַח נְצָחִים” (“forever and ever,” Isa. 34:10). Psalm 16 dares to attach that adverb not to judgment but to joy.

By the time we reach this last line, “my good is not beyond You” (v. 2) has been spelled out. Good is not land, nor absence of trouble, nor long life narrowly conceived. Good is to have God as one’s portion, to be guided by God’s counsel, to live with God “always before me,” and to trust that such a life is not finally negated by death. It is no accident that Jewish communities recite this psalm in houses of mourning and on the eve of Yom Kippur. Psalm 16 is an argument, in eleven verses, that the only inheritance death cannot take is a life lived in the presence of God.

  
## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

#### Full psalm

In Sefardic and Mizrachi practice, Psalm 16 is recited in full during weekday *Shacharit* in a house of mourning (*Beit Avel*) on days when *Tachanun* is omitted, often as a substitute for Psalm 49. Its opening plea, “שׇֽׁמְרֵנִי אֵל כִּֽי־חָסִיתִי בָךְ – Guard me, O God, for I have taken refuge in You,” and its closing assurance, “תּוֹדִיעֵנִי אֹרַח חַיִּים… – You make known to me the path of life…,” make it a natural vehicle for consolation.

According to the Edot HaMizrach rite, the entire psalm is also recited as part of the extended *Selichot* on the eve of Yom Kippur, during *Maariv*. There it follows a plea for forgiveness (“אֲדֹנָי שְׁמָעָה…”) and leads into the confessional prayers, embodying the move from supplication to trust.

#### Key verses

**Psalm 16:7**

> אֲבָרֵךְ אֶת־יְהוָה אֲשֶׁר יְעָצָנִי; אַף־לֵילוֹת יִסְּרוּנִי כִלְיוֹתָי׃  
> “I will bless the LORD who has counseled me; even at nights my kidneys instruct me.”

In the Yom Kippur eve *Selichot* of Edot HaMizrach, this verse introduces the recitation of the psalm and supports a petition for divine guidance in repentance: “אֲבָרֵךְ אֶת־יְהוָה אֲשֶׁר יְעָצָנִי – I bless the LORD who has counseled me,” framing the whole atonement process as a response to God’s prior counsel.

**Psalm 16:11**

> תּוֹדִיעֵנִי אֹרַח חַיִּים; שֹׂבַע שְׂמָחוֹת אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ; נְעִמוֹת בִּימִינְךָ נֶצַח׃  
> “You make known to me the path of life; satiety of joys is in Your presence; delights are at Your right hand forever.”

On the first night of Rosh Hashanah, Edot HaMizrach recite this verse in the home as part of a poetic prelude to *Kiddush*: “תִּפְתַּח לָנוּ שַׁעֲרֵי תְּבוּנָה… תּוֹדִיעֵנִי אֹרַח חַיִּים, שֹׂבַע שְׂמָחוֹת אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ, נְעִמוֹת בִּימִינְךָ נֶצַח – Open for us the gates of understanding…You make known to me the path of life….” The same verse appears in their *Neilah* Amidah on Yom Kippur: “וְהוֹדִיעֵנוּ דֶּרֶךְ תְּשׁוּבָה, אֹרַח חַיִּים שֹׂבַע שְׂמָחוֹת אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ, וְחָתְמֵנוּ לְחַיִּים טוֹבִים.” Liturgically, “path of life” becomes both the road of repentance and the hope for a good decree.

#### Phrases

Several short phrases from Psalm 16 have been woven into very different liturgical settings, often in ways that reveal how tradition has heard their theology.

1. **Psalm 16:1 – שׇֽׁמְרֵנִי אֵל כִּֽי־חָסִיתִי בָךְ**  
   “Guard me, O God, for I have taken refuge in You.”

   In the Sefardic repetition of the Amidah during the Priestly Blessing, the congregation responds to the Kohanim’s “וְיִשְׁמְרֶךָ – and may He guard you” (Numbers 6:24) with verses about divine protection, including:  
   > “וְיִשְׁמְרֶךָ. שָׁמְרֵנִי אֵל כִּי חָסִיתִי בָךְ; שָׁמְרֵנִי כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת עָיִן, בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנִי׃”  
   “And may He guard you. Guard me, O God, for I have taken refuge in You; guard me like the apple of the eye, hide me in the shadow of Your wings.”  

   The verse is thus heard as a human echo to the priestly promise.

2. **Psalm 16:5 – יְהוָה מְנָת חֶלְקִי**

   In the Selichot for the fast of the Tenth of Tevet, a piyyut laments the siege of Jerusalem but moves toward hope with:  
   > “יְהוָה מְנָת חֶלְקִי, חוּשָׁה לִי לְעֶזְרָה; וּפִתַּחְתָּ שַׂקִּי, שִׂמְחָה לִי לְאַזְרָה׃”  
   “The LORD is my allotted portion, hasten to my aid; You have loosed my sackcloth, You have girded me with joy.”  

   Here “YHWH as portion” becomes a national consolation in exile.

3. **Psalm 16:8 – שִׁוִּיתִי יְהוָה לְנֶגְדִּי תָמִיד**

   This line is not regularly recited but functions as a halakhic and spiritual principle. Sefardic manuals for *Tachanun* quote it to explain why, during *Nefilat Apayim*, some lean on the right arm: “כְּשֶׁנּוֹפֵל עַל פָּנָיו…מִשּׁוּם דִּכְתִיב שִׁוִּיתִי ה' לְנֶגְדִּי תָמִיד – When one falls on his face…because it is written, ‘I have set the LORD always before me.’” Many synagogues inscribe the phrase above the ark as a visual discipline of constant God-consciousness.

4. **Psalm 16:11 – שֹׂבַע שְׂמָחוֹת אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ / נְעִמוֹת בִּימִינְךָ נֶצַח**

   In the Ashkenazic *Avodah* of Yom Kippur, a piyyut about the future restoration of Zion prays:  
   > “נֵצַח נְצָחִים תְּנוֹסְסָהּ; שֹׂבַע שְׂמָחוֹת תַּשְׂבִּיעֶנָּה; עֲנַן עָשָׁן תְּעַטְּרֶנָּה׃”  
   “Raise her up for all eternity; sate her with an abundance of joys; crown her with a cloud of smoke.”  

   The psalm’s personal “satiety of joys in Your presence” is here applied to a redeemed Jerusalem.  

   In the Lag Ba’Omer piyyut “Bar Yochai,” the line “שֹׂבַע שְׂמָחוֹת אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ” is repurposed to praise Rabbi Chizkiyah as one whose face reflects such joy, showing how the verse’s language of divine intimacy can be used to celebrate human spiritual attainment.
