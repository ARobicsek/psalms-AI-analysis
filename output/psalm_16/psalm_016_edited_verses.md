**Verse 1**

מִכְתָּם לְדָוִד; שׇֽׁמְרֵנִי אֵל, כִּי־חָסִיתִי בָךְ׃  

“A *miktam* of David. Guard me, O God, for I have taken refuge in You.”

The superscription “מִכְתָּם לְדָוִד” introduces a rare term. BDB simply notes it as a technical label of unknown meaning. Medieval guesses split in three directions: from כֶּתֶם (“gold”), making this a “precious” song; from כָּתַם (“to engrave”), hence something inscribed; or from כִּפֶּר (“to atone”), hinting at expiatory use. The ancient Greek translators rendered it στηλογραφία, “inscription,” as if this psalm were suitable for carving in stone. While etymology is uncertain, the psalm’s tone of lasting commitment fits the idea of an inscription.

The first colon, “שׇֽׁמְרֵנִי אֵל – Guard me, O God,” uses the short divine title אֵל, focusing on raw divine power. The imperative שׇֽׁמְרֵנִי (“guard me, keep me”) opens several psalms of lament and trust. Here it is immediately grounded in a reason clause: “כִּי־חָסִיתִי בָךְ – for I have taken refuge in You.” The verb חָסָה (to seek refuge) is one of the Psalter’s key trust-words, often paired with concrete images of shelters and strongholds: “בְּךָ יְהוָה חָסִיתִי – In You, O LORD, I have taken refuge” (Ps. 31:2); “יְהוָה מָעוּזִּי…בְּךָ חָסִיתִי – The LORD is my stronghold…in You I have taken refuge” (Ps. 43:2).

Notably, the psalmist does not say “if you guard me, I will trust in you,” but the reverse: “Guard me, for I *have* taken refuge in You.” Trust is not the *result* of deliverance; it is the prior act that justifies the plea. In grammatical terms, the perfect “I have taken refuge” presents trust as a completed orientation, not a mood that may change tomorrow.

The Torah Temimah draws attention to a liturgical echo. In the Sefardic Priestly Blessing, when the Kohanim declare “וְיִשְׁמְרֶךָ – may He guard you” (Num. 6:24), the congregation answers with verses like ours: “שׇׁמְרֵנִי אֵל כִּי־חָסִיתִי בָךְ – Guard me, O God, for I have taken refuge in You.” The people effectively say: we have already placed ourselves under Your protection; now let the priestly promise be fulfilled.

Structurally, v. 1 functions as a miniature of the whole psalm. It combines petition (“Guard me”) with confession of trust (“for I have taken refuge in You”). The rest of the poem will unpack what that refuge means—what is being traded away, and what is being received in return. The opening “אל” will soon give way to the covenant name יהוה (YHWH) and to “אֲדֹנָי” (“my master,” v. 2), tracking a movement from sheer power to personal relationship. But already here the logic is set: exclusive reliance on God licenses bold requests of God.

**Verse 2**

אָמַ֣רְתְּ לַיהוָה, אֲדֹנָי אָתָּה; טוֹבָתִי בַּל־עָלֶיךָ׃  

“I say to YHWH, ‘You are my Lord; my good is not beyond You.’”

The opening verb “אָמַרְתְּ – you have said” is feminine singular. Traditional commentators hear the psalmist addressing his own soul: “You, my soul, have said to YHWH, ‘You are my Lord.’” Rashi also offers an alternative: David addressing the community of Israel—“It is upon you to say to the LORD, ‘You are the Master.’” In either case, the psalm dramatizes an internal or communal act of declaration.

The progression of divine titles is striking. In v. 1 God was אֵל, the strong one. Here He is יהוה (YHWH), the covenant name, paired with אֲדֹנָי (“my master”). The relationship is no longer merely that of a vulnerable creature to a powerful deity, but of a vassal to a personal Lord: “You are my Lord.”

The theological crux is the second colon: “טוֹבָתִי בַּל־עָלֶיךָ.” The particle בַּל is an emphatic “not,” a stronger form than לֹא. Does the verse say “my good is not *apart* from You,” as many modern translations render, meaning that any genuine good in life is bound to God? Or “my goodness does not *reach* You,” in the sense of Job 22:2–3, where Eliphaz asks, “Can a man be of use to God…Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that you are righteous?”

Radak preserves both tunes. First, with Rashi and Rabbi Moses ha-Cohen ibn Gikatilla, he reads: “The good which You do to me is not imposed upon You as an obligation…all is grace from You.” On that reading, טוֹבָתִי is “the good You do to me,” and the line humbles human claims on God. Then Radak adds his father’s interpretation: “The good that I do is not unto You; that is, it does not reach You.” Human virtue cannot enrich the divine.

The Masoretic pointing leaves room for a third, perhaps primary nuance: “My good is not beyond You,” that is, there is no other “good” outside God. This fits the psalm’s logic. Having just named YHWH as “my Lord,” the speaker now relativizes all other goods—land, security, prosperity—as derivative at best. This anticipates v. 5: “YHWH is the portion of my share.” It also sets up the rejection of other allegiances in vv. 3–4.

The New Testament will later hear a different voice in this psalm, reading v. 7 (“He said to me, ‘You are my son, today I have begotten you’” in Ps. 2) alongside our v. 2. Jewish tradition, however, keeps the focus on the ordinary worshiper. The Torah Temimah cites a midrash in which the community says to God: “הַחֲזֵק לִי טוֹבָתִי – hold my good firm for my sake,” glossing טוֹבָתִי as the legacy of forefathers’ merits. Whether we read the “good” as God’s undeserved kindness, our inadequate righteousness, or God alone as the only true good, the effect is the same: Psalm 16 begins by shrinking human claims and enlarging the space God occupies in the definition of “good.”

**Verse 3**

לִקְדוֹשִׁים אֲשֶׁר־בָּאָרֶץ הֵמָּה; וְאַדִּירֵי, כׇּל־חֶפְצִי־בָם׃  

“As for the holy ones who are in the land—they; and the mighty ones—all my desire is in them.”

This is arguably the most syntactically opaque line in the psalm. Two groups are named: “the holy ones who are in the land” (לִקְדוֹשִׁים אֲשֶׁר־בָּאָרֶץ) and “the mighty ones” (וְאַדִּירֵי), followed by the phrase “all my desire is in them” (כׇל־חֶפְצִי־בָם). The odd repetition “they” (הֵמָּה) has led some to see sarcasm—“those so-called ‘holy ones’,” perhaps idols or heavenly beings. But both traditional exegesis and later liturgical use point in a different direction.

Rashi famously reads the “holy ones” as the righteous ancestors buried in the land, “who walked before You in truth.” “They are the mighty ones in whom is all my delight and for whose sake all my necessities are accomplished.” Meiri follows, combining patriarchs and later saints: “For the sake of the holy ones who have already died and are in the earth You do this for me.” On this view, the psalmist’s present safety and joy are understood as a continuation of the covenantal story; God treats him kindly “for Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob’s sake.”

Ibn Ezra and Radak construe the verse more horizontally. For Ibn Ezra, “holy ones” are the pious contemporaries who, like the psalmist, are devoted to God. “Because I love You, I love those who are holy, and I do good to them.” Radak similarly: they are “those who are most excellent of heart…my delight is in them to do them good, because they keep and do Your commandments.” Love of God extends naturally to love of those who are God’s.

The Mishnah’s usage in *Avot* 6:10 is decisive for the verse’s reception. Citing Exodus 15:16 (“until Your people pass through, O LORD, until the people You have acquired”), it adds: “וְאוֹמֵר: לִקְדוֹשִׁים אֲשֶׁר־בָּאָרֶץ הֵמָּה, וְאַדִּירֵי כׇּל־חֶפְצִי־בָם׃ – And it says: ‘As for the holy ones who are in the land…all my desire is in them.’” Here the “holy ones” are Israel as a whole, God’s treasured acquisition. In other words, early rabbinic tradition hears this verse as celebrating God’s people, not mocking foreign gods.

How then does v. 3 relate to v. 4, with its ban on other deities? In terms of parallelism, vv. 3–4 form an antithetic pair: A is so, and what’s more, not B. Positively, the psalmist’s “delight” (חֵפֶץ) is bound up with the community of the faithful. Negatively, he repudiates alternative cults. The love of God’s “holy ones” is not vague philanthropy; it is part of an exclusive covenant.

At a deeper level, this verse acknowledges that trust in God is never purely vertical. To choose “YHWH as portion” entails joining oneself to a people who make that same choice—and disentangling oneself from other networks of loyalty. Psalm 16 thus already hints that inheritance in God is communal, not just personal.

**Verse 4**

יִרְבּוּ עַצְּבוֹתָם, אַחֵר מָהָרוּ;  
בַּל־אַסִּיךְ נִסְכֵּיהֶם מִדָּם; וּבַל־אֶשָּׂא אֶת־שְׁמוֹתָם עַל־שְׂפָתָי׃  

“Many will be the pains of those who hasten after another [god];  
I will not pour their libations of blood, nor will I lift up their names upon my lips.”

The first half of the verse pronounces a kind of proverb: “יִרְבּוּ עַצְּבוֹתָם – their sorrows will be many.” The object of that warning is “those who hasten after another” (אַחֵר מָהָרוּ). The implied noun is “god,” as in the Decalogue’s “אֱלֹהִים אֲחֵרִים – other gods.” The verb מָהַר in the simple stem usually means “to hurry,” but it can also mean “to pay a bride-price” (מוֹהַר). Rashi notes both senses: idolaters “hasten and scurry” to idolatry, and they “pay a dowry” to another god, like an adulterous spouse. The prophets love this marital metaphor for covenant betrayal (see Hosea 2; Jeremiah 3).

There is a pun lurking here. The word עַצְּבוֹת (“pains, sorrows”) is related to עָצָב (“idol”). Isaiah warns Israel not to say, “My idol (עַצְבִּי) did this” (Isa. 48:5). In Psalm 16 the proliferation of foreign gods is mirrored in the multiplication of “sorrows”—a bitterly appropriate harvest.

The psalmist’s response is marked by two emphatic *bal* negations: “בַּל־אַסִּיךְ…וּבַל־אֶשָּׂא.” This stronger form of “no” (as opposed to לֹא) appears three times in our psalm (vv. 4, 8, 10), each time to draw a clear line: I will not join that worship; I shall not be shaken; You will not abandon my soul. Here it frames two renunciations.

First: “I will not pour their libations of blood” (נִסְכֵּיהֶם מִדָּם). The verb נָסַךְ is the normal term for pouring drink-offerings at the altar. Our psalm transposes it into a foreign cult and attaches it to “blood,” either literally (blood libations) or metaphorically (sacrifices funded by violence). Radak takes it in the latter sense, echoing Malachi’s rebuke, “You bring what is stolen” (מְבִיאִים גָזוּל, Mal. 1:13): the offerings are “from blood,” that is, from robbery and oppression.

The Torah Temimah notes how the Talmud builds on this phrase. In Sanhedrin 60b, when the rabbis list the acts that count as idolatrous service, they include “one who pours a libation,” citing “בַּל־אַסִּיךְ נִסְכֵּיהֶם מִדָּם.” The psalm’s negative example becomes a halakhic category: libation (even of water or wine) to an idol is forbidden.

Second: “I will not lift up their names on my lips.” This line directly recalls Exodus 23:13: “שֵׁם אֱלֹהִים אֲחֵרִים לֹא תַזְכִּירוּ, לֹא יִשָּׁמַע עַל־פִּיךָ – The name of other gods you shall not mention; it shall not be heard upon your mouth.” The psalmist obeys that command poetically, refusing even to articulate the names of rival deities. Later Jewish usage, uncomfortable with speaking “Baal,” will euphemize it as “the Shameful Thing” (הַבּשֶׁת), a direct outworking of this sensibility.

Verses 3–4, then, draw the negative space around v. 5’s positive confession. Loving God’s “holy ones” and refusing other gods’ rites are two sides of declaring “YHWH is my portion.” The psalmist’s inheritance is safeguarded not only by God’s grace, but by disciplined refusal.

**Verse 5**

יְהוָה מְנָת־חֶלְקִי וְכוֹסִי; אַתָּה תּוֹמִיךְ גּוֹרָלִי׃  

“YHWH is the portion of my share and my cup; You hold fast my lot.”

This verse is the theological center of the psalm. Four words anchor it: יְהוָה (subject), מְנָת־חֶלְקִי (“portion of my share”), כּוֹסִי (“my cup”), and גּוֹרָלִי (“my lot”). Together they transpose the language of land allotment and temple feasting into a single metaphor.

The phrase מְנָת־חֶלְקִי combines two near-synonyms. חֵלֶק is a “share” in a division; מָנָה is a “portion” one receives. BDB notes that מְנָת, in later biblical Hebrew, often refers to the assigned share of offerings for priests and Levites. Here the doubling is emphatic: my share, my portion, is YHWH. The psalmist claims for himself what was said about Levi: “יְהוָה הוּא נַחֲלָתוֹ – YHWH is his inheritance” (Deut. 10:9).

The image “my cup” (כּוֹסִי) is equally dense. A “cup” in biblical idiom can signify one’s destiny or experience, whether pleasant or bitter. “The LORD is my shepherd…my cup overflows” (כּוֹסִי רְוָיָה, Ps. 23:5); conversely, “in the hand of YHWH is a cup…all the wicked of the earth shall drain it” (Ps. 75:9), the cup of judgment. Psalm 16 deliberately juxtaposes its “cup” with the “libations of blood” in v. 4. The psalmist will not pour out wine or blood to other gods; instead he receives from YHWH a cup that is his true lot.

The final colon, “אַתָּה תּוֹמִיךְ גּוֹרָלִי – You hold fast my lot,” completes the inheritance metaphor. גּוֹרָל is the “lot” by which tribal lands were assigned (see Joshua 18–19). To say God “upholds” that lot (from תמך, “to support, hold up”) is to say that this inheritance—God Himself—is neither arbitrary nor fragile. Rashi offers a homely simile: it is “like a man who loves one of his sons and places his hand on the good share, saying, ‘This one is reserved for you.’”

Other psalms echo this language. “חֶלְקִי יְהוָה – The LORD is my portion,” says Psalm 119:57, adding, “I have resolved to keep Your words.” Psalm 73, wrestling with the prosperity of the wicked, concludes: “צוּר־לְבָבִי וְחֶלְקִי אֱלֹהִים לְעוֹלָם – God is the rock of my heart and my portion forever” (Ps. 73:26). In all these texts, “portion” language marks a moment when old metrics of success—land, wealth, status—give way to the conviction that the only secure “share” is God. Psalm 16 is distinctive in its concentration: here “portion,” “cup,” and “lot” cluster in one breath.

In Jewish liturgy, this verse has become a protest against historical loss. A Selichot poem for the fast of the Tenth of Tevet, lamenting the siege of Jerusalem, cries out: “יְהוָה מְנָת חֶלְקִי חוּשָׁה לִי לְעֶזְרָה – ‘The LORD is my allotted portion, hasten to my aid.’” When land, temple, and sovereignty are gone, Psalm 16’s claim is what remains.

**Verse 6**

חֲבָלִים נָפְלוּ־לִי בַּנְּעִמִים; אַף־נַחֲלָת שָׁפְרָה עָלָי׃  

“The lines have fallen for me in pleasant [places]; yes, my inheritance is beautiful to me.”

Verse 6 continues the inheritance metaphor with the language of surveying. חֲבָלִים (“cords, measuring-lines”) are the ropes used to mark out boundaries. נָפְלוּ (“have fallen”) is the idiom for how a lot “falls” when cast. Joshua uses the same verb for tribal allotments: “וַיֵּצֵא הַגּוֹרָל… – the lot came out…” (Josh. 18:11). Our psalm appropriates that technical phrasing for a spiritual estate.

The phrase “בַּנְּעִמִים – in pleasant places” draws on the root נעם (“pleasant, sweet, delightful”), used elsewhere for the “pleasantness of YHWH” (נֹעַם יְהוָה, Ps. 27:4) or the “pleasant dwelling” of Zion (Ps. 16’s own later liturgical echoes). Radak interprets these “pleasant places” as “good and right knowledge”—a life shaped by sound understanding of God. In terms of parallelism, the second colon explicates the first: “My inheritance” (נַחֲלָת) is the same as the “lines” that have “fallen”; what was abstractly called “portion” in v. 5 is now imagined as a landscape, and the psalmist declares that landscape beautiful.

The little particle אַף (“indeed, even”) at the start of the second colon carries a psychological observation. Radak notes that when people divide property, “each one envies his fellow’s portion and imagines that his fellow’s portion is better than his own; but not so with me. My inheritance is beautiful *to me*.” Contentment here is not objective but relational: because the inheritance is God, the psalmist does not measure it against someone else’s plot.

The noun נַחֲלָת is grammatically unusual. The Masoretic text reads נַחֲלָת (with final tav) followed by שָׁפְרָה (“has become pleasant”). Radak comments that the tav stands where we might expect a heh, and that the word is not in construct—so we should understand it as “my inheritance,” not “the inheritance of…”. Similar forms include “עָזִּי וְזִמְרַת יָהּ – my strength and song is YH” (Exod. 15:2), where זִמְרַת is formally absolute yet behaves like “my song.”

Other biblical texts speak of “measuring-line” (חֶבֶל) in connection with inheritance. Psalm 105:11 recalls God’s promise: “אֲמֹר לְךָ אֶתֵּן אֶת־אֶרֶץ כְּנָעַן, חֶבֶל נַחֲלַתְכֶם – ‘To you I will give the land of Canaan, the measuring-line of your inheritance.’” Isaiah can also reverse the image, threatening a ruined land measured out “with a line of chaos” (קַו־תֹהוּ, Isa. 34:11). Psalm 16 stands at the positive end of that spectrum: the “line” that marks out this worshiper’s life is a line of pleasantness.

The verse also carries an implicit contrast with v. 4. Those who “hasten after another” multiply their “sorrows” (עַצְּבוֹת); the psalmist, by contrast, finds himself in “pleasant” (נְעִימִים) places. The assonance between עַצְּבוֹתָם (“their sorrows”) and נְעִימִים (“pleasant things”) may not be accidental; the psalm plays sorrows and pleasures off against each other, locating the dividing line not in circumstances but in the object of trust.

**Verse 7**

אֲבָרֵךְ אֶת־יְהוָה אֲשֶׁר יְעָצָנִי; אַף־לֵילוֹת יִסְּרוּנִי כִלְיוֹתָי׃  

“I will bless YHWH who has counseled me; even at nights my kidneys instruct me.”

The first colon shifts from declaration to response: “I will bless” (אֲבָרֵךְ) is a volitional form, expressing determined praise. In biblical Hebrew, “to bless God” means to speak well of, thank, or praise God; one cannot confer benefit on the divine, only acknowledge it. Psalm 103’s refrain, “בָּרְכִי נַפְשִׁי אֶת־יְהוָה – Bless the LORD, O my soul,” is a close cousin.

The cause of this blessing is that God “has counseled me” (יְעָצָנִי). The same root עָצָה (“to counsel”) is used of God’s wise plans in Isaiah 40:13–14. Psalm 16 applies it to the individual’s moral and spiritual formation. Radak links this back to v. 5: “as we have explained ‘You hold my lot’,” meaning God’s counsel helped the psalmist choose YHWH as his portion.

The second colon moves from external counsel to internalized instruction: “even at nights my kidneys instruct me.” As noted in the introduction, the kidneys (כִלְיוֹת) are, in biblical anthropology, organs of conscience and deep emotion. Psalm 26, for example, prays: “צָרְפָה כִלְיוֹתַי וְלִבִּי – test my kidneys and my heart” (Ps. 26:2). Jeremiah calls God “בֹחֵן כְּלָיוֹת וָלֵב – tester of kidneys and heart” (Jer. 11:20). Our psalm goes a step further: the kidneys themselves “discipline” (יִסְּרוּנִי, from יָסַר, “to chastise, instruct”) the psalmist.

The temporal phrase “אַף־לֵילוֹת – even at nights” is important. Night symbolizes vulnerability and introspection. Job 33:15–16 pictures God speaking to people in “a dream, a vision of the night…then He opens the ears of men and seals their instruction.” Here, the night is when external business falls away and the inner voice—the fruit of God’s counsel—can be heard. Meiri suggests this includes both spontaneous moral awareness and deliberate study: “I investigated by myself and understood through books.”

Halakhically and spiritually, the verse has been read as a charter for nocturnal Torah study. Rashi cites a midrash about Abraham learning Torah before it was given, guided by his “kidneys,” and concludes: “We too must sit up nights and learn Torah.” The idea is that God’s counsel is not only transmitted externally (Sinai, prophets) but, over time, is internalized as a habit of heart that continues to “instruct” us even in the dark.

The pairing of God’s counsel and the kidneys’ discipline illustrates a broader biblical pattern: external revelation and internal conscience are meant to converge. Psalm 16, which began with a plea for protection, now presents a more demanding dimension of refuge: to take shelter in God is to submit to His counsel—even when that counsel comes as an uncomfortable inner corrective in the middle of the night.

**Verse 8**

שִׁוִּיתִי יְהוָה לְנֶגְדִּי תָמִיד; כִּי מִימִינִי בַּל־אֶמּוֹט׃  

“I have set YHWH before me always; because He is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken.”

This verse has become a watchword of Jewish spirituality, but its force depends on reading both cola together. The first states a human discipline; the second gives the reason it is effective.

“שִׁוִּיתִי יְהוָה לְנֶגְדִּי תָמִיד – I have set YHWH before me always.” The verb שִׁוִּיתִי (from שׁוה) can mean “to set, place” or “to make level, equal.” The image is visual and spatial: the psalmist has placed God “before” (לְנֶגְדִּי, literally “opposite”) him, in his constant field of attention. The perfect tense suggests an achieved practice rather than a wish: “I have done this, and I continue in it.” The adverb תָמִיד (“continually”) is the same used of the continual burnt offering and the perpetual lamp in the sanctuary. What the temple does architecturally—keep the presence of YHWH always before the community—this individual does mentally.

The second colon explains why such an orientation produces stability: “כִּי מִימִינִי בַּל־אֶמּוֹט – because He is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken.” In biblical idiom, the “right hand” is the place of strength and honor. Psalm 110:1 has God say to the king, “שֵׁב לִימִינִי – sit at my right hand.” Psalm 139:10 assures: “גַּם־שָׁם יָדְךָ תַנְחֵנִי, וְתֹאחֲזֵנִי יְמִינֶךָ – even there Your hand will guide me, Your right hand will hold me fast.” Our verse reverses the direction: God is at *our* right hand, supporting us.

The verb אֶמּוֹט (“I shall be shaken, moved”) belongs to a cluster of trust-psalm assurances: “עֹשֵׂה־אֵלֶּה לֹא יִמּוֹט לְעוֹלָם – one who does these things shall never be shaken” (Ps. 15:5); “כִּי־לְעוֹלָם לֹא יִמּוֹט – surely he shall never be shaken” (Ps. 112:6). Proverbs 10:30 applies the phrase to the righteous: “צַדִּיק לְעוֹלָם בַּל־יִמּוֹט – The righteous will never be shaken.” Psalm 16 stands in that tradition but gives a more specific ground: stability comes from practiced awareness of God’s presence.

Jewish law codifies this verse as a principle. The Shulchan Arukh (Orach Chayim 1:1) opens its code of daily conduct by quoting “שִׁוִּיתִי יְהוָה לְנֶגְדִּי תָמִיד” and calling it “a great rule” in the spiritual life. Synagogues engrave the phrase above the ark so that, quite literally, worshipers “set YHWH before” their eyes.

Interestingly, Sefardic liturgy uses our verse to regulate bodily posture in *Tachanun*. During the penitential “falling on the face” (נפילת אפיים), some lean on the right arm “because it is written, שִׁוִּיתִי יְהוָה לְנֶגְדִּי תָמִיד כִּי מִימִינִי בַּל־אֶמּוֹט – ‘I have set the LORD always before me, for He is at my right hand; I shall not be shaken.’” The theological claim—that God stands at our right hand—becomes a physical gesture.

In the logic of the psalm, this verse marks the transition from inheritance language (vv. 5–6) and interior counsel (v. 7) to joy and eschatological confidence (vv. 9–11). From here on, the voice is that of someone who has learned to walk through life with God always “before” him and “at his right hand.” The fear of being shaken, whether by enemies or by death, is countered not by denial but by disciplined attention.

**Verse 9**

לָכֵן שָׂמַח לִבִּי וַיָּגֶל כְּבוֹדִי; אַף־בְּשָׂרִי יִשְׁכֹּן לָבֶטַח׃  

“Therefore my heart rejoices and my glory exults; even my flesh dwells secure.”

The adverb לָכֵן (“therefore”) explicitly connects this verse to the preceding assurance: because God is at my right hand (v. 8), certain consequences follow in the psalmist’s whole being.

“שָׂמַח לִבִּי – my heart rejoices.” In biblical idiom the “heart” (לֵב) is not primarily the seat of emotion but of thought, intent, and decision. To say “my heart rejoices” is to say that at the level of understanding and will, one rests content in God’s presence and counsel.

“וַיָּגֶל כְּבוֹדִי – and my glory exults.” As we saw, כְּבוֹדִי (my “glory”) is ambiguous. The Greek Septuagint famously renders it “my tongue,” an interpretation taken up in Acts 2:26. Radak and many Jewish interpreters take “my glory” as a circumlocution for the soul: “the soul, which is the glory of the body; for I am confident that when it is separated from the body it will cleave to its Creator.” Meiri reads the line as a progression: “my heart—that is, the intellect; my glory—that is, the soul.” The paired verbs also suggest intensification: שָׂמַח implies joy; גִּיל (“to exult”) connotes exuberant, even physical rejoicing.

The third member of the triad, “אַף־בְּשָׂרִי יִשְׁכֹּן לָבֶטַח – even my flesh dwells secure,” adds the dimension of vulnerable mortality. בָּשָׂר (“flesh”) in Hebrew points to the frailty of embodied life: “כׇּל־הַבָּשָׂר חָצִיר – all flesh is grass” (Isa. 40:6). That such flesh “dwells secure” (יִשְׁכֹּן לָבֶטַח) is remarkable. The verb שָׁכַן (“to dwell, settle”) is the root of מִשְׁכָּן (tabernacle); what is normally said of God’s presence—dwelling in the sanctuary—is here said of the psalmist’s body: it “dwells” in trust.

In rabbinic midrash, this phrase is sometimes pushed in an eschatological direction. The Torah Temimah cites a reading of “יִשְׁכֹּן לָבֶטַח” as a hint of resurrection—the flesh will “dwell securely” after death, not forever subject to decay. Whether or not that is the original sense, the verse certainly prepares the ground for v. 10’s bold hope regarding Sheol and “the Pit.”

The structure of the line—heart, glory, flesh—presents a concentric picture of personhood. Inner cognition rejoices; the animating life-force exults; the outer, physical existence relaxes its vigilance. In the context of the psalm, such holistic joy is not denial of danger but the fruit of v. 8’s practiced God-consciousness and of the inheritance redefined in vv. 5–6. It is precisely because the psalmist’s “portion” is God, not land or fortune, that even his flesh can “pitch its tent” (יִשְׁכֹּן) in security.

**Verse 10**

כִּי לֹא־תַעֲזֹב נַפְשִׁי לִשְׁאוֹל; לֹא־תִתֵּן חֲסִידְךָ לִרְאוֹת שָׁחַת׃  

“For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol; You will not give Your faithful one to see the Pit.”

This verse provides the rationale for the bodily security just described (“for You will not…”). Two key terms need clarifying for a modern reader: נֶפֶשׁ and שְׁאוֹל.

נֶפֶשׁ (here “my soul,” נַפְשִׁי) does not mean an immaterial “soul” in the later philosophical sense. In Hebrew it is the life-self, the “me” that lives, desires, and suffers. שְׁאוֹל is the underworld, the realm of the dead, associated with the grave and with distance from the realm of praise. Isaiah has Hezekiah lament: “For Sheol does not thank You, death does not praise You” (Isa. 38:18). “Pit” (שַׁחַת) is a poetic counterpart: a deep hole into which one descends in death.

Against this background, “You will not abandon my soul to Sheol” can be heard on at least two levels. At a minimum, it expresses confidence that God will not let the psalmist die prematurely or disgracefully, especially at the hands of enemies. The second colon, “You will not give Your faithful one to see the Pit,” reinforces that sense: the חסיד (“faithful, pious one”) will not have his story end in ruin.

But the language pushes further. “To see the Pit” (לִרְאוֹת שָׁחַת) means to experience death as an ultimate negation. Other psalms use similar phrasing but add a twist of hope. Psalm 49 contrasts those who trust in riches, who “like sheep are appointed for Sheol” (49:15), with the speaker’s confidence: “אַךְ־אֱלֹהִים יִפְדֶּה נַפְשִׁי מִיַּד שְׁאוֹל – But God will redeem my soul from the hand of Sheol” (49:16). Psalm 73, after envying the wicked, comes to say: “וַאֲנִי תָמִיד עִמָּךְ…וְאַחַר כָּבוֹד תִּקָּחֵנִי – But as for me, I am always with You…afterwards You will take me with glory” (73:23–24). Psalm 16 stands in this small cluster of texts that refuse to let Sheol have the last word over a life lived in faithful trust.

The New Testament, reading the Greek Septuagint’s version of this verse (“You will not let Your Holy One see decay,” Acts 2:27), applies it directly to the resurrection of Jesus. Jewish tradition did not go in that direction, but rabbinic sources still hear in the verse an affirmation that God does not abandon those who bring merit to others. Yoma 87a warns that a teacher who leads many into righteousness will not be left in Gehenna while his pupils are in Eden, “for it is written, כִּי לֹא־תַעֲזֹב נַפְשִׁי לִשְׁאוֹל – You will not abandon my soul to Sheol.”

Does Psalm 16, in its own voice, teach personal immortality? It is more cautious than that. It expresses confidence that the relationship named in v. 2 (“You are my Lord”) and embodied in v. 8 (“I have set YHWH before me always”) is not nullified by death. Whether that means extraordinary rescue from dying, protection from an early grave, or some form of ongoing life with God beyond death’s veil, the psalm deliberately resists seeing the “Pit” as definitive for the חסיד. Its final verse will sketch what such a God-secured “afterwards” looks like.

**Verse 11**

תּוֹדִיעֵנִי אֹרַח חַיִּים; שֹׂבַע שְׂמָחוֹת אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ; נְעִמֹת בִּימִינְךָ נֶצַח׃  

“You make known to me the path of life; satiety of joys is in Your presence; delights are at Your right hand forever.”

The closing verse gathers the psalm’s themes—guidance, joy, God’s “right hand,” and permanence—into a compact doxology.

“תּוֹדִיעֵנִי אֹרַח חַיִּים – You make known to me the path of life.” The noun אֹרַח (“track, path”) plus חַיִּים (“life”) occurs in wisdom literature: “אֹרַח לְחַיִּים שׁוֹמֵר מוּסָר – The path of life is he who heeds discipline” (Prov. 10:17); “אֹרַח חַיִּים לְמַעְלָה לְמַשְׂכִּיל – The path of life leads upward for the prudent” (Prov. 15:24). There, the sage discovers the path through moral reflection and instruction. In Psalm 16, by contrast, the path is God’s gift: “You make [it] known to me.” The “counsel” of v. 7 and the “setting of YHWH before me” in v. 8 are part of that disclosure.

The next colon names the destination rather than the road: “שֹׂבַע שְׂמָחוֹת אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ – satiety of joys [is] in Your presence.” The noun שֹׂבַע (from שׂבע, “to be sated”) is stronger than “fullness”; it evokes being filled up to repletion. שְׂמָחוֹת (“joys”) in the plural suggests a rich variety of delights. All of this is located “אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ – with Your face,” that is, in the sphere of direct divine presence. Psalm 21:7 uses similar language: “תְּחַדֵּהוּ בְשִׂמְחָה אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ – You gladden him with joy in Your presence.”

The last colon mirrors v. 8’s “He is at my right hand” from God’s perspective: “נְעִמֹת בִּימִינְךָ נֶצַח – delights are at Your right hand forever.” נְעִמֹת (from נעם) are “pleasant things, delights,” the same root as “pleasant places” (נְעִימִים) in v. 6. What was a metaphorical landscape then is now an eschatological horizon. The “right hand” (יְמִין) here is God’s own, the hand that in Psalm 63 “upholds” the worshiper: “דָּבְקָה נַפְשִׁי אַחֲרֶיךָ, בִּי תָּמְכָה יְמִינֶךָ – My soul clings after You; Your right hand upholds me” (Ps. 63:9). Psalm 16’s journey moves from God at *our* right hand (v. 8) to our joy at *God’s* right hand (v. 11).

The final word, נֶצַח, carries the weight of duration. BDB glosses it as “eminence, enduring, everlastingness.” It appears in phrases like “לָנֶצַח – forever” (e.g., Amos 1:11) and in the eschatological “to the age of nitzachim” (Isa. 34:10). Here it secures the delights at God’s right hand against erosion. The psalm closes its argument: if YHWH is my portion, and if right relation to YHWH is not finally cancelled by the grave, then the true “inheritance” is a life-path that culminates in unending joy before God’s face.

Jewish liturgy hears this eschatological music. On Rosh Hashanah night and at *Neilah*, the line “אֹרַח חַיִּים שֹׂבַע שְׂמָחוֹת אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ” becomes a plea for a good inscription in the book of life. In the Hoshanah Rabbah *Hoshanot*, Ashkenazic piyyut weaves “נְעִימֹת בִּימִינְךָ נֶצַח” into its closing petitions. And in the Yom Kippur *Avodah*, “שֹׂבַע שְׂמָחוֹת” is applied to restored Zion. Each usage assumes that Psalm 16 has redefined the “good” appropriate to Israel’s hope: not merely surviving another year, but being led onto a path whose end is the satiety of joys in the presence of God.
