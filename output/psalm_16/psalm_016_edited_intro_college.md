#### A mysterious “michtam” and a very bold claim

Psalm 16 opens with a word nobody really understands:

> מִכְתָּ֥ם לְדָוִ֑ד  
> *Mikhtam le‑David* — “A michtam of David”

*Mikhtam* (מִכְתָּם) appears only in six psalm headings, all “of David.” The ancient Greek translators (the Septuagint) rendered it στηλογραφία, “inscription on a pillar,” as if it were something carved to last. Medieval Jewish commentators guess wildly: maybe from כֶּתֶם (*ketem*, “gold”) = “a golden poem”; maybe from כתם = “to inscribe”; maybe from כפר (*kappar*, “atone”). Bottom line: no one knows.

That’s weirdly appropriate, because the psalm itself is about **what really lasts**. Not a stone monument, but a relationship. Not land, but God.

Right near the center the poet makes the key claim:

> יְהוָה מְנָת־חֶלְקִי וְכוֹסִי; אַתָּה תּוֹמִיךְ גּוֹרָלִי׃ (v.5)  
> “YHWH is my allotted portion and my cup; You secure my lot.”

If you hear that as religious poetry‑blur (“God is everything to me!”), you’ll miss how radical it is. In ancient Israel, **inheritance** usually meant actual land. This psalm says: my real inheritance is *not* a piece of territory. My inheritance is *God*.

The whole poem explores what it feels like to live as if that were true — in daily choices, in nighttime conscience, and even at the edge of death.

#### A quick map of what we’re reading

Here’s a simple roadmap:

- **v.1** – Opening plea: “Guard me, O God, for I have taken refuge in You.”
- **vv.2–4** – Declaration of exclusive loyalty to YHWH and rejection of other gods.
- **vv.5–6** – The core: a dense cluster of inheritance words. God = my land, my lot, my beautiful portion.
- **vv.7–8** – How this plays out in daily life: God’s counsel and a practice of “setting YHWH before me always.”
- **vv.9–11** – The emotional payoff: joy, bodily security, and a daring hope that even Sheol (the underworld / grave) can’t break this relationship.

You can think of it as moving along a path:

> Refuge → Choice → Inheritance → Daily practice → Joy beyond death

#### From Levites to everyone: God as inheritance

Verses 5–6 are where the psalm really bends the usual theology:

> יְהוָה מְנָת־חֶלְקִי וְכוֹסִי;  
> אַתָּה תּוֹמִיךְ גּוֹרָלִי׃  
> חֲבָלִים נָפְלוּ־לִי בַּנְּעִמִים;  
> אַף־נַחֲלָת שָׁפְרָה עָלָי׃  
>  
> “YHWH is the portion of my share and my cup;  
> You secure my lot.  
> The measuring‑lines have fallen for me in pleasant places;  
> Yes, my inheritance is beautiful to me.”

Count the land‑distribution words:

- **מְנָת** (*menat*) – assigned portion
- **חֵלֶק** (*ḥeleq*) – share
- **כּוֹס** (*kos*) – literally “cup,” but often metaphorically “lot” or “portion” (as in “cup of destiny”)
- **גּוֹרָל** (*gôral*) – lot, the thing you cast to assign land or tasks
- **חֲבָלִים** (*ḥavalim*) – cords / measuring lines
- **נַחֲלָה** (*naḥalāh*) – inheritance, estate

This is exactly the technical vocabulary used when Joshua divides up the land among the tribes (Joshua 13–21). But those stories are about geography: “The lot (גּוֹרָל) came up for Judah…” etc.

There is one Old Testament group that doesn’t get land as inheritance: the **Levites**. God tells them:

> לֹ֣א תִנְחַ֗ל בְּאַרְצָם... אֲנִ֤י חֶלְקְךָ֙ וְנַחֲלָתְךָ֔ (Num 18:20)  
> “You shall have no inheritance in their land… *I* am your portion and your inheritance.”

And:

> יְהוָה הוּא נַחֲלָתוֹ (Deut 10:9)  
> “YHWH is his inheritance.”

Psalm 16 takes this priestly privilege and **democratizes** it. You don’t have to be a Levite. Any Israelite who “takes refuge” in YHWH and refuses other gods can say:

> יְהוָה מְנָת־חֶלְקִי — “YHWH is the portion of my share.”

That’s huge. Land can be lost in war or exile. A relationship with God — at least in theory — can travel with you. This is one way the Bible begins to shift Jewish identity from land‑based to presence‑based, which later made survival in exile possible.

#### Two ways to live: with the “holy ones” or the idol‑chasers

Verses 3–4 are among the hardest in the psalm, but the basic contrast is clear once you slow down.

> לִקְדוֹשִׁים אֲשֶׁר־בָּאָרֶץ הֵמָּה,  
> וְאַדִּירֵי; כׇּל־חֶפְצִי־בָם׃  
> יִרְבּוּ עַצְּבוֹתָם; אַחֵר מָהָרוּ.  
> בַּל־אַסִּיךְ נִסְכֵּיהֶם מִדָּם;  
> וּבַל־אֶשָּׂא אֶת־שְׁמוֹתָם עַל־שְׂפָתָי׃

Literally:

- “As for the holy ones who are in the land, they, and the mighty/majestic ones — all my desire is in them.”
- “Their sorrows will multiply — those who hasten after another [god]. I will not pour out their blood‑libations, and I will not carry their names on my lips.”

Who are the **קְדוֹשִׁים** (*qedoshim*, “holy ones”) and **אַדִּירִים** (*adirim*, “mighty ones”)? Classical options:

- Rashi: the *ancestors* buried in the land, whose merit helps their descendants.
- Ibn Ezra / Radak: the *pious Israelites* of the psalmist’s generation — “those who keep and do Your commandments.”
- Malbim: **not** humans at all, but pagan “holy ones” (gods / astral beings), which would make v.3 ironic and flow straight into v.4’s rejection.

The Mishnah (Avot 6:10) clearly reads the verse positively about Israel:

> לִקְדוֹשִׁים אֲשֶׁר־בָּאָרֶץ הֵמָּה... כׇּל־חֶפְצִי־בָם׃  
> “the holy ones who are in the land… in whom is all My delight.”

On that reading, vv.3–4 say: **I align myself with your holy people, not with idol worshippers**. I’ll cling to them; I’ll completely avoid the others’ bloody sacrifices and even their *names* (compare Exodus 23:13: “the names of other gods you shall not mention”).

So you get a fork in the road:

- Side with YHWH’s holy people → end up with “pleasant places” and a “beautiful inheritance” (vv.5–6).
- Chase other gods (אַחֵר מָהָרוּ, “they hurried after another”) → “their sorrows will multiply” (יִרְבּוּ עַצְּבוֹתָם).

The psalm is a poetic version of Deuteronomy’s choice: “life and good, or death and evil” (Deut 30:15).

#### Days, nights, forever: a timeline of trust

The psalm plays with time words in a neat way:

- **“Nights”** (לֵילוֹת, v.7) – when the kidneys instruct.
- **“Always”** (תָמִיד, v.8) – when YHWH is “set before me.”
- **“Forever”** (נֶצַח, v.11) – how long the delights at God’s right hand last.

Verse 7:

> אֲבָרֵךְ אֶת־יְהוָה אֲשֶׁר יְעָצָנִי;  
> אַף־לֵילוֹת יִסְּרוּנִי כִלְיוֹתָי׃  
>  
> “I bless YHWH who has counseled me;  
> even at night my kidneys instruct me.”

In biblical anthropology, the **kidneys** (*kilyot*) are the seat of conscience and deep emotion. Jeremiah 17:10, for example:

> אֲנִי יְהוָה חֹקֵר לֵב, בֹּחֵן כְּלָיוֹת  
> “I, YHWH, probe the heart, I test the kidneys.”

So v.7 pictures God’s guidance as both **external counsel** (“He has counseled me”) and **internal moral sense** (“my kidneys discipline me”), especially at night when distractions quiet down.

Then verse 8 moves to a continuous state:

> שִׁוִּיתִי יְהוָה לְנֶגְדִּי תָמִיד;  
> כִּי מִימִינִי בַּל־אֶמּוֹט׃  
>  
> “I have set YHWH before me always;  
> because He is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken.”

The verb שִׁוִּיתִי (*shivviti*) literally means “I have set / placed / made level.” It’s a **deliberate mental practice**: I keep YHWH in my field of vision. The second line explains why this practice gives stability: if God is like your right‑hand supporter in battle or in court, “you will not totter” (compare Psalm 17:5: בַּל־נָמוֹטּוּ פְעָמָי, “my steps will *not* slip”).

Finally, v.11 reaches into the future:

> תּוֹדִיעֵנִי אֹרַח חַיִּים... נְעִמֹת בִּימִינְךָ נֶצַח׃  
> “You make known to me the path of life… delights in Your right hand forever.”

Here the “right hand” shifts: in v.8, God is at *my* right hand; in v.11, *I* enjoy delights at **God’s** right hand — the place of highest honor. The timeline runs:

- God teaches me **now**, even at night.
- I consciously place Him **always** before me.
- He leads me along a “path of life” that ends in **forever** joy in His presence.

#### So…is this about resurrection?

Verse 10 is the theological cliff‑edge:

> כִּי לֹא־תַעֲזֹב נַפְשִׁי לִשְׁאוֹל;  
> לֹא־תִתֵּן חֲסִידְךָ לִרְאוֹת שָׁחַת׃  
>  
> “For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol;  
> You will not let Your faithful one see the Pit.”

**Sheol** (שְׁאוֹל) in the Hebrew Bible is the underworld / grave — the shadowy place where *everyone* goes. **Shaḥat** (שַׁחַת) is “pit” or “corruption / decay.” Taken strictly, the verse seems to say: “I’m not going to end up rotting in the grave.”

Christians very early read this as about resurrection and applied it to Jesus (see Acts 2:25–31). In its original setting, though, it’s probably not a fully developed resurrection doctrine yet. Rather, it’s a **radically confident trust** that:

- God will not let the psalmist die prematurely, *or*
- Even if he dies, his bond with God will somehow continue, not be “abandoned.”

Compare Psalm 73:23–24, 26:

> וַאֲנִי תָמִיד עִמָּךְ… אַחַר כָּבוֹד תִּקָּחֵנִי…  
> צַר־לְבָבִי וְחֶלְקִי אֱלֹהִים לְעוֹלָם׃  
>  
> “Yet I am always with You… afterward You will take me with glory…  
> God is the rock of my heart and my portion forever.”

Psalm 16 pushes in the same direction: if God is truly “my portion,” maybe even Sheol can’t cancel that.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

#### Full psalm

In several Jewish traditions, Psalm 16 is heard at moments of vulnerability and hope.

- **House of mourning (Beit Avel)** – In many Sefardic and Mizrachi communities, the *entire psalm* is recited during weekday *Shacharit* in a house of mourning on days when *Tachanun* is omitted. It often substitutes for Psalm 49. The mourners say, for example:

  > תּוֹדִיעֵנִי אֹרַח חַיִּים שֹׂבַע שְׂמָחוֹת אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ׃  
  > “You will make known to me the path of life; in Your presence is fullness of joy” (v.11)

  — as a quiet protest against death’s finality.

- **Erev Yom Kippur (Edot HaMizrach)** – In the Eastern tradition, Psalm 16 is recited as a unit within the long *Selichot* (penitential prayers) on the night of Yom Kippur, just before the confession. The psalm’s mix of trust, self‑examination, and hope for life “at Your right hand forever” (v.11) makes it a natural prelude to the Day of Atonement.

#### Key verses

- **Psalm 16:5 – יְהוָה מְנָת חֶלְקִי**

  > יְהוָה מְנָת־חֶלְקִי וְכוֹסִי; אַתָּה תּוֹמִיךְ גּוֹרָלִי׃  
  > “YHWH is the portion of my share and my cup; You secure my lot.”

  This line appears in a *Selichot* poem for the fast of the Tenth of Tevet. The piyyut cries:

  > יְהוָה מְנָת חֶלְקִי חוּשָׁה לִי לְעֶזְרָה,  
  > “YHWH is my allotted portion, hasten to my aid,”

  turning the psalmist’s serene confession into a communal plea for help amid national mourning.

#### Phrases

- **שָׁמְרֵנִי אֵל כִּי־חָסִיתִי בָךְ (v.1)**  
  “Guard me, O God, for I have taken refuge in You.”

  In the Sefardic *Birkat Kohanim* (Priestly Blessing), when the priests say “וְיִשְׁמְרֶךָ” (“and may He guard you”), the congregation responds:

  > שָׁמְרֵנִי אֵל כִּי־חָסִיתִי בָךְ;  
  > שָׁמְרֵנִי כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת עָיִן…  
  > “Guard me, O God, for I have taken refuge in You; guard me like the apple of the eye…”

  weaving Psalm 16:1 into a dialogue of blessing and trust.

- **שִׁוִּיתִי יְהוָה לְנֶגְדִּי תָמִיד (v.8)**  
  “I have set YHWH before me always.”

  This verse isn’t usually recited aloud; instead, it shapes practice. The *Shulchan Aruch* opens with it: *“שִׁוִּיתִי ה’ לְנֶגְדִּי תָמִיד — this is a great principle in the Torah”* (Orach Chaim 1:1). Many synagogues hang the words “שִׁוִּיתִי ה’ לְנֶגְדִּי תָמִיד” above the ark as a constant visual reminder.

  In some Sefardic siddurim, the custom of leaning on the right arm during *Tachanun* is explained “מִשּׁוּם דִּכְתִיב שִׁוִּיתִי ה’ לְנֶגְדִּי תָמִיד, כִּי מִימִינִי בַּל־אֶמּוֹט” — because God is imagined at one’s right hand.

- **תּוֹדִיעֵנִי אֹרַח חַיִּים שֹׂבַע שְׂמָחוֹת אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ (v.11)**  
  “You will make known to me the path of life; fullness of joys is in Your presence.”

  In the Eastern tradition, this phrase appears in the *Neilah* (closing) service of Yom Kippur, in a plea like:

  > וְהוֹדִיעֵנוּ דֶּרֶךְ תְּשׁוּבָה, אֹרַח חַיִּים שֹׂבַע שְׂמָחוֹת אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ;  
  > “Make known to us the way of repentance, the path of life, fullness of joys in Your presence,”

  linking Psalm 16’s “path of life” directly to the hope of being written and sealed for life in the new year.
