# Introduction Essay

The prayer a leader offers before battle reveals what kind of world he believes himself to inhabit. Psalm 20 is such a prayer, but its theology is radical: military security depends not on superior armaments but on covenant relationship with YHWH, mediated through His anointed king. This pre-battle liturgy dramatizes a pivotal moment where anxious petition transforms into confident declaration, articulating the central tension of Israel's monarchy—how to maintain military strength while rejecting the militaristic ideology of surrounding nations.

The psalm's structure traces a liturgical drama in multiple voices. Verses 2-6 open with a cascade of seven jussive verbs—*ya'ankhā* (יַֽעַנְךָ֣, "may He answer you"), *yəśaggēḇeḵā* (יְ֝שַׂגֶּבְךָ֗, "may He protect you"), *yišlaḥ* (יִשְׁלַֽח, "may He send"), *yisʿāḏeḵā* (יִסְעָדֶֽךָּ, "may He sustain you"), *yizkōr* (יִזְכֹּ֥ר, "may He remember"), *yəḏaššəneh* (יְדַשְּׁנֶ֣ה, "may He approve"), *yitten* (יִתֶּן, "may He grant")—creating a liturgical litany. The community intercedes for the king, petitioning God to "send your help from the sanctuary" (v. 3, יִשְׁלַֽח־עֶזְרְךָ֥ מִקֹּ֑דֶשׁ), to "remember all your meal offerings" (v. 4, יִזְכֹּ֥ר כָּל־מִנְחֹתֶֽיךָ), and to "fulfill all your counsel" (v. 5, וְֽכׇל־עֲצָתְךָ֥ יְמַלֵּֽא). This opening section establishes the psalm's spatial theology: divine help originates not just from God but specifically *from* sacred space—"from the sanctuary and from Zion" (מִקֹּ֑דֶשׁ וּ֝מִצִּיּ֗וֹן, v. 3).

Then comes the turning point. Verse 7 shifts abruptly from communal petition to individual declaration: "Now I know (*ʿattâ yāḏaʿtî*, עַתָּ֤ה יָדַ֗עְתִּי) that the LORD will give victory to His anointed" (כִּ֤י הוֹשִׁ֥יעַ ׀ יְהֹוָ֗ה מְשִׁ֫יח֥וֹ). The verb tense switches from jussive wish to perfect confidence. The pronoun shifts from second person ("you," the king) to third person ("His anointed"). Someone—a prophet? a priest? the community's representative voice?—has received assurance. The spatial movement also ascends: whereas verse 3 locates divine help in the earthly sanctuary (*miqqōḏeš*), verse 7 declares that God "will answer him from His heavenly sanctuary" (*miššəmê qoḏšô*, מִשְּׁמֵ֣י קׇדְשׁ֑וֹ). The liturgy enacts a double movement—from earth to heaven, from petition to certainty.

This pivotal verse raises the psalm's most vexing question: who speaks the words "Now I know"? The shift from addressing the king directly to referring to "His anointed" in the third person suggests a prophetic oracle, similar to moments in other psalms where divine assurance interrupts human plea (compare Ps 12:6: "Now I will arise, says the LORD"). Yet the collective "we" returns immediately in verse 8, creating an interpretive puzzle. Perhaps the soloist speaks on behalf of the community, or perhaps the liturgy deliberately blurs individual and corporate voice to signify that prophetic insight becomes communal knowledge. The traditional commentators wrestle with this ambiguity. Radak suggests "each and every one of Israel will say: now I know," democratizing the prophetic moment. Ibn Ezra proposes the poet speaks "with the holy spirit," locating authority in inspired utterance. Malbim offers an intriguing historical reconstruction: the psalm reflects a moment when messengers arrived in Jerusalem with news of David's miraculous deliverance while the congregation was still praying for him, transforming anxious petition into spontaneous testimony.

What follows is theological polemic disguised as military reporting. Verses 8-9 construct an elaborate antithetical parallelism: "These [call] on chariots, these [call] on horses, but we call on the name of the LORD our God" (*'ēlleh ḇāreḵeḇ wə'ēlleh ḇassûsîm wa'ănaḥnû bəšēm-YHWH 'ĕlōhênû*, אֵ֣לֶּה בָ֭רֶכֶב וְאֵ֣לֶּה בַסּוּסִ֑ים וַאֲנַ֓חְנוּ ׀ בְּשֵׁם־יְהֹוָ֖ה אֱלֹהֵ֣ינוּ נַזְכִּֽיר). The demonstrative pronouns (*'ēlleh*... *'ēlleh*... *wa'ănaḥnû*) create a stark us-versus-them structure. The verb *nazkîr* (נַזְכִּֽיר) is deliberately ambiguous—it can mean "remember," "invoke," "proclaim," or even "boast in." Rashi understands it as an expression of prayer and sacrifice, "like 'he who burns (*mazkhîr*, מַזְכִּיר) frankincense'" (Isa 66:3). The polemic continues: "They collapse and fall, but we rise and stand firm" (v. 9, הֵ֭מָּה כָּרְע֣וּ וְנָפָ֑לוּ וַאֲנַ֥חְנוּ קַּ֝֗מְנוּ וַנִּתְעוֹדָֽד). The prophetic perfect—completed action describing future events—expresses such confidence that the outcome is spoken of as already accomplished.

This theology of radical trust must be understood against its Ancient Near Eastern context. The prohibition against trusting in horses and chariots echoes Deuteronomy's royal law: "he must not multiply horses" (Deut 17:16). Isaiah mocks those who "trust in chariots because they are many" (Isa 31:1). Hosea demands Israel renounce military self-reliance: "Assyria will not save us, we will not ride on horses" (Hos 14:4). Psalm 33, which shares multiple vocabulary roots with Psalm 20, makes the same claim: "A king is not saved by a mighty army... the horse is a false hope for salvation" (Ps 33:16-17, אֵֽין־הַ֭מֶּלֶךְ נוֹשָׁ֣ע בְּרׇב־חָ֑יִל גִּ֝בּ֗וֹר... שֶׁ֣קֶר הַ֭סּוּס לִתְשׁוּעָ֑ה). But Psalm 20 and 33 are not merely making the same point; they are in deliberate conversation. Both psalms use nearly identical phrases about God's name (Ps 20:2, 6, 8; Ps 33:21: *bəšēm qoḏšô*, בְשֵׁ֖ם קׇדְשׁ֣וֹ), both speak of divine counsel (*'ăṣat YHWH*, עֲצַ֣ת יְ֭הֹוָה in Ps 33:11; *'ăṣātəḵā* עֲצָתְךָ֥ in Ps 20:5), and both conclude with prayers for divine response. The liturgical pairing suggests these psalms were composed or arranged to be read together as complementary meditations on the same theme.

The psalm's threefold use of "name" theology deserves closer attention. Verse 2 invokes "the name of the God of Jacob" (šēm 'ĕlōhê ya'ăqōḇ, שֵׁ֤ם אֱלֹהֵ֬י יַעֲקֹֽב), verse 6 petitions "in the name of our God" (*ûḇəšēm-'ĕlōhênû*, וּבְשֵֽׁם־אֱלֹהֵ֥ינוּ), and verse 8 declares trust "in the name of the LORD our God" (*bəšēm-YHWH 'ĕlōhênû*, בְּשֵׁם־יְהֹוָ֖ה אֱלֹהֵ֣ינוּ). The progression is deliberate: from "the God of Jacob" (patriarchal promise) to "our God" (communal relationship) to "the LORD our God" (full covenant formula with the tetragrammaton). In verse 2, "name" functions almost as a hypostatized agent—it is the name itself that "keeps you safe" (*yəśaggēḇeḵā*, יְ֝שַׂגֶּבְךָ֗). This is not mere metaphor but reflects Deuteronomistic theology of divine presence: God causes His name to dwell in the Temple (Deut 12:11, *ləšakkēn šəmô šām*, לְשַׁכֵּ֤ן שְׁמוֹ֙ שָׁ֔ם), making "name" the mode of God's localized presence while preserving His transcendence.

The psalm's final verse introduces a syntactic ambiguity that may be theologically intentional. The Hebrew *haMMeleḵ ya'ănēnû* (הַ֝מֶּ֗לֶךְ יַעֲנֵ֥נוּ) can be parsed two ways: "O King, answer us" (vocative, addressing God) or "May the king answer us" (subject, referring to the human king). Ibn Ezra, ever alert to grammatical possibilities, notes both readings, preferring the vocative: "*haMMeleḵ* is God, who is truly King." Radak agrees: "The King means God, who is King of the universe." But Malbim's historical reconstruction suggests a deliberate double meaning: the community prays "O LORD, save" (*YHWH hôšî'â*, יְהוָ֥ה הוֹשִׁ֑יעָה) and receives an answer from the human king David, who responds by declaring his trust in divine deliverance alone. The ambiguity allows the verse to collapse the distinction between divine and royal authority—appropriate for a psalm that sees the anointed king as the mediator of YHWH's saving power.

The lexical research reveals further dimensions of meaning. The verb *yəḏaššəneh* (יְדַשְּׁנֶ֣ה, "may He approve") in verse 4 comes from the root *dāšēn* (דָּשֵׁן, "fat"), creating a striking anthropomorphism: God will "find fat" in the king's burnt offering, meaning He will accept it favorably. BDB notes this is "unusual anthropomorphic language for divine response to sacrifice," emphasizing the visceral, embodied nature of divine favor. The rare Hithpael form *wanniṯ'ôḏāḏ* (וַנִּתְעוֹדָֽד, "and we stand firm") in verse 9 carries nuances of being "restored" or "strengthened"—not just standing up but gaining renewed vigor. The concordance search for *kārə'û wənāp̄ālû* (כָּרְע֣וּ וְנָפָ֑לוּ, "they collapse and fall") reveals only one other biblical occurrence of this exact pair in Isaiah 46:2, where Babylonian idols "cower and bow down together" before YHWH's sovereignty. The intertextual echo is potent: what happens to false gods in Isaiah happens to those who trust in horses and chariots in Psalm 20.

This psalm's canonical significance lies in its theological boldness. It dares to claim that conventional military strength is "false" (*šeqer*, שֶׁ֣קֶר, Ps 33:17) while divine name-invocation is real power. For a small kingdom constantly threatened by imperial neighbors, this was not mere spiritualization but a stark political theology. The psalm insists that Israel's security depends not on matching Assyrian cavalry horse-for-horse but on maintaining covenantal fidelity. Jewish liturgy has preserved this countercultural claim by placing Psalm 20 in the weekday Shacharit service, where it follows the Amidah in both Ashkenazic and Sefardic traditions. The verse *YHWH hôšî'â haMMeleḵ ya'ănēnû* (יְהוָ֥ה הוֹשִׁ֑יעָה הַ֝מֶּ֗לֶךְ יַעֲנֵ֥נוּ, "O LORD, save! May the King answer us") appears throughout the liturgy as a climactic petition, forming the third part of a standard triad: "The LORD of hosts is with us" (Ps 46:8), "LORD of hosts, happy is the man who trusts in You" (Ps 84:13), "O LORD, save! May the King answer us on the day we call" (Ps 20:10).

The psalm's literary achievement is its transformation of petition into proclamation. It begins with anxious prayer and ends with confident testimony, enacting in its very structure the movement from fear to faith. The pivot comes not through argument but through liturgical drama—the oracle moment of verse 7 when "I know" replaces "may He grant." This is the psalm's central insight: that worship itself can generate certainty, that the act of communal prayer in sacred space becomes the channel through which divine assurance arrives. The psalm does not merely describe trust in God's name; it performs that trust, inviting subsequent generations of worshipers to re-enact the drama from petition to proclamation, from "answer us" to "now I know."

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

Psalm 20 functions prominently in Jewish liturgy as a supplication for divine intervention, recited primarily on occasions requiring petition rather than praise. Its most widespread appearance is in the weekday Shacharit service, where it is recited after the Amidah—in the Ashkenazic rite as part of the Tachanun supplications, in the Sefardic tradition within the concluding prayers. This placement on weekdays only (omitted on Shabbat and festivals) reflects the tradition's understanding of the psalm's opening plea, "May the LORD answer you on a day of trouble" (יַֽעַנְךָ֣ יְ֭הֹוָה בְּי֣וֹם צָרָ֑ה), as appropriate for times of need rather than celebration.

Individual verses from Psalm 20 appear throughout the liturgical cycle with remarkable frequency. The climactic petition of verse 10, "O LORD, save! May the King answer us on the day
