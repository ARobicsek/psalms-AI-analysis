# Editorial Assessment (College Edition) - Psalm 20

The existing introduction and commentary do many things well for an advanced reader: they are rich in philological detail, they integrate traditional commentators (Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Radak, Malbim, etc.), and they notice real poetic features (the “answer” inclusio, the “name” motif, the spatial movement from Temple to heaven, the anti-chariot polemic). The macro-thesis—that Psalm 20 is a pre-battle royal liturgy that pivots from anxious petition to confident assurance—is sound and well supported.

For a first‑year college student, though, there are several problems:

- **Too much jargon, rarely defined.** Terms like “jussive,” “Deuteronomistic theology,” “hypostatized agent,” “prophetic perfect,” “Hithpael,” “metonymy,” “antithetical parallelism,” “Sitz im Leben” appear without explanation. This is fine for grad school; it’s rough for a nineteen‑year‑old who’s just getting their bearings.
- **Density and abstraction.** The prose often reads like a journal article: long sentences, heavy with subordinate clauses and references to secondary scholarship. The big ideas are good, but they’re buried.
- **A few factual slips.** E.g., the verse 4 discussion implies there are multiple instances of סֶלָה (selah) in this psalm; in fact Psalm 20 has only one Selah (v. 4). The “cascade of seven jussives” undercounts and underexplains the actual wish-forms in vv. 2–6.
- **Missed “teaching moments.”** Some excellent data in the research bundle are barely used: the Torah Temimah on “Elohei Ya‘akov,” the liturgical re-use of key verses, the pairing with Psalm 21, and the tight theological dialogue with Psalm 33. These are exactly the things that can make a bright first‑year say, “Oh, wow—that’s cool.”
- **Liturgical section unfinished and under-structured.** The bundle gives rich information about where and how Psalm 20 is prayed; the draft barely starts to use it.

The revision needs to (1) keep the good insights, (2) explain every technical term in plain language the first time it appears, (3) use more examples and short Hebrew quotations to show patterns, and (4) adopt a more conversational, “let’s look at this together” voice that still respects the student’s intelligence.
