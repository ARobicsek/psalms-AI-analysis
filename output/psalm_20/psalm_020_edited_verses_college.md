**Verse 1**

לַמְנַצֵּ֗חַ; מִזְמ֥וֹר לְדָוִֽד׃  
“For the leader. A psalm of David.”

The superscription is short, but it tells you a lot about how this poem was used.

לַמְנַצֵּחַ (lamnatseach) comes from the root נ־צ־ח, which can mean “to be pre‑eminent” or “to supervise.” In the Psalms it almost always appears in headings and in Chronicles for Levitical officials in charge of music. So most scholars (and traditional commentators like Ibn Ezra) take it as “for the choirmaster / music director”: this psalm was handed to a professional who would lead it in the Temple service.

The Greek Septuagint (an ancient translation) renders it εἰς τὸ τέλος, “unto the end,” which early Christian writers read as “about the end times.” That’s interesting historically, but in the original setting, the musical/liturgical meaning is more straightforward.

מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד (mizmor le-David) raises the classic lamed‑question: does it mean “by David,” “for David,” or “about David”? Grammatically all three are possible. Here, the content pushes you toward “for/about David”:

- In vv. 2–6 **someone else** speaks to a singular “you” who is going out to battle.
- In v. 7 that “you” is called “His anointed” (מְשִׁיחוֹ), a standard way to refer to the Davidic king.
- Meiri (a 13th‑c. commentator) explicitly says: “David composed this so that the Levites would say it **about him** whenever he went out to war.”

So the heading probably doesn’t mean “David wrote this for his personal devotions,” but something like, “A psalm framed around David, to be performed under the choirmaster.” That already tells you this is **public liturgy**, not private diary.

**Verse 2**

יַעַנְךָ יְהוָה בְּיוֹם צָרָה;  
יְשַׂגֶּבְךָ שֵׁם אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב׃  

“May the LORD answer you on a day of trouble;  
may the name of the God of Jacob set you securely on high.”

Right away we enter the liturgical language of blessing. יַעַנְךָ (ya‘ancha) is a **jussive** form—Hebrew’s way of saying “may He answer you,” a wish rather than a description. The subject “the LORD” (יְהוָה) comes after the verb in Hebrew, but the sense is clear: the community is asking God to respond favorably to the king’s prayer.

“Day of trouble” (בְּיוֹם צָרָה) is a stock phrase for acute crisis, often military. Compare Psalm 50:15:  

> וּקְרָאֵנִי בְּיוֹם צָרָה; אֲחַלֶּצְךָ וּתְכַבְּדֵנִי׃  
> “Call on Me on a day of trouble; I will rescue you, and you will honor Me.”

What’s striking is the second half: “may the **name** of the God of Jacob keep you safe.” Grammatically, שֵׁם אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב (“the name of the God of Jacob”) is the subject of יְשַׂגֶּבְךָ (“may [He/it] set you safely on high”). It’s not “may God, who has a name, protect you,” but “may the **name** itself protect you.”

This reflects the Deuteronomic idea that God causes His **name** to dwell in the Temple (Deut 12:11: לְשַׁכֵּן שְׁמוֹ שָׁם). God in His essence is not boxed into Jerusalem, but His name—His revealed identity and reputation—is there in a focused way. So to be protected “by the name” is to be sheltered by God’s **public, covenantal identity**.

Why “the God of Jacob” and not “of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob”? Radak notes: Jacob lived through more visible “troubles” than the other patriarchs—Esau, Laban, fear of Esau again, famine, loss of Joseph. Midrash (quoted by Torah Temimah) picks this up with a vivid image: just as Jacob was saved even when he was pressed **into the beam** (there’s a saying: “from here, to the beam‑carrier who goes into the thickness of the beam”), so God saves you when you’re wedged into tight spots.

Liturgically, this verse lives on in the plural form:  

> יַעֲנֵנוּ יְהוָה בְּיוֹם צָרָה; יְשַׂגְּבֵנוּ שֵׁם אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב׃  
> “May the LORD answer **us** on a day of trouble; may the name of the God of Jacob protect **us**.”

That line is said in Taḥanun as a communal plea. What was once a royal blessing—“you, the king”—becomes available to everyone.

**Verse 3**

יִשְׁלַח־עֶזְרְךָ מִקֹּדֶשׁ;  
וּמִצִּיּוֹן יִסְעָדֶךָּ׃  

“May He send you help from the sanctuary;  
from Zion may He support you.”

Notice the geography. There are two **“from”** phrases (both with מִן):

- מִקֹּדֶשׁ (miqqodesh) – “from the sanctuary,” i.e., from the holy place.
- וּמִצִּיּוֹן (u-miTsiyon) – “and from Zion,” the hill in Jerusalem where the Temple stands.

Radak glosses: “From the holy place, where the ark was; for there is the Glory, and from there He will send your help in battle.” So קֹדֶשׁ here is likely “the holy place” of the Temple, and “Zion” then names the larger sacred hill on which that building sits. The two lines work from **inside out**: inner shrine → the whole mount.

The verbs are also interesting:

- יִשְׁלַח (yishlach) – “may He **send**,” a very active, almost military verb (you send troops, messengers, help).
- יִסְעָדֶךָּ (yis‘adekha) – from סעד, “to support, sustain, hold up.” In prose it can mean “sustain the heart with food” (Gen 18:5); here it has a more martial feel: “may He be your backup.”

So the picture is: the king is out on campaign; the Temple is behind him, literally and spiritually. From that building in Zion, help is “sent” and ongoing support “upholds” him.

Verse 7 will “zoom out” even further and say God answers “from His holy heavens” (מִשְּׁמֵי קׇדְשׁוֹ). That doesn’t contradict this verse; it deepens it. The Temple in Zion is the **earthly end** of heavenly help.

**Verse 4**

יִזְכֹּר כָּל־מִנְחֹתֶךָ;  
וְעֹלָתְךָ יְדַשְּׁנֶה סֶלָה׃  

“May He remember all your grain offerings;  
and your burnt offering may He make fat. Selah.”

Now we’re at the sacrificial part of the liturgy. Two specific offerings are named:

- מִנְחָה (minchah) – usually a **grain offering**: fine flour with oil and frankincense (see Leviticus 2).
- עֹלָה (‘olah) – the **burnt offering**, an animal wholly consumed on the altar (Leviticus 1).

To “remember” (יִזְכֹּר, yizkor) in biblical Hebrew is never just “Oh right, I forgot that.” When God “remembers” Noah, the floodwaters go down (Gen 8:1). When He “remembers” His covenant, the Exodus begins (Exod 2:24). So “may He remember all your minchot” means “may He take those deeds into account now and act to help you.”

The second verb is the fun one: יְדַשְּׁנֶה (yedashs̆eneh), from דָשֵׁן (dashen), “to be/make fat.” BDB notes that in this context it’s a vivid **anthropomorphism**—language that describes God in bodily terms. The idea is: “May He **treat your burnt offering as fat**, i.e. rich and pleasing.” Rashi paraphrases: “He will accept them willingly like fat burnt offerings.”

So the line pictures God as a kind of heavenly diner who smells the rich smoke and is pleased. Obviously no one thinks God literally eats; the image communicates **favor**: your offering is rich, delightful, fully accepted.

סֶלָה (Selah) is one of those opaque musical markers. It likely signals a pause or a musical interlude. Here it comes right after the sacrificial scene, as if to say: stop and let the picture of smoke rising, God “remembering,” and accepting the offering sink in before the prayer moves on.

Also notice that Psalm 20 has **only this one Selah**, right here in verse 4. That places a little stress mark in the psalm: after we’ve invoked God’s name and location (vv. 2–3) and brought sacrifices (v. 4), we pause. Next come requests for strategy and success.

**Verse 5**

יִתֵּן־לְךָ כִלְבָבֶךָ;  
וְכָל־עֲצָתְךָ יְמַלֵּא׃  

“May He grant you according to your heart;  
and may He fulfill all your plan.”

We move from the Temple courtyard inward—to the king’s **inner life**.

כִלְבָבֶךָ (kilvavekha) literally means “according to your heart.” In idiomatic English: “your heart’s desire.” A parallel in Psalm 21, clearly echoing this verse, says:  

> תַּאֲוַת לִבּוֹ נָתַתָּה לּוֹ (Ps 21:3)  
> “You have given him his heart’s desire.”

So the people are asking that what the king *truly wants* be granted. That immediately raises a worry: what if the king’s heart is corrupt? Midrash, noticed by Radak, solves this cleverly: we only say such a blessing to someone like David, “who was wholehearted before his Creator.” To ordinary mortals you don’t say, “May God give you exactly what’s in your heart,” because sometimes what’s in there is theft, lust, or worse.

The second line moves from raw desire to thought‑out strategy: עֲצָה (etzah) means “counsel, plan.” It can be your own deliberation or the joint advice of your war‑council. “May He **fulfill** (יִמַלֵּא, yimale’) all your counsel” uses the verb מלא (“to fill, complete”). The image is of a plan being brought to full completion.

This verse is beautifully balanced with verse 6, which ends:

> יְמַלֵּא יְהוָה כָּל־מִשְׁאֲלוֹתֶיךָ׃  
> “May the LORD fulfill all your requests.”

In v. 5 the focus is on **inner planning** (עֲצָה); in v. 6 on **spoken requests** (מִשְׁאֲלוֹת). Both use כָּל (“all”) and the same verb יְמַלֵּא. That repetition hammers home the wish for *complete* divine backing—of the king’s thoughts and his prayers.

Malbim, reading very historically, imagines singers saying this **after** hearing news of David’s deliverance: “What was in your heart has been granted; your counsel—to rely on God rather than on chariots—has been fulfilled.” Whether or not you buy that reconstruction, it’s a nice example of how the psalm’s phrases could be heard both as **before‑battle wishes** and **after‑battle interpretations**.

**Verse 6**

נְרַנְּנָה בִישׁוּעָתֶךָ;  
וּבְשֵׁם־אֱלֹהֵינוּ נִדְגֹּל;  
יְמַלֵּא יְהוָה כָּל־מִשְׁאֲלוֹתֶיךָ׃  

“Let us shout for joy in your victory;  
and in the name of our God let us raise our banners.  
May the LORD fulfill all your requests.”

Here the grammar shifts: נְרַנְּנָה (nərannənah) is **cohortative** (“let us shout / we will surely shout”), and we finally hear a **first‑person plural**: “we.” Up to now, the “you” (singular) has been the king; now the supporters step into the frame: your victory will be **our celebration**.

The word root ר־נ־ן means “to shout or sing loudly,” usually in joy. “Your victory” (יְשׁוּעָתֶךָ) starts a cluster of salvation words (it’s from the same root as יֵשַׁע in v. 7 and הוֹשִׁיעָה in v. 10).

The hapax verb נִדְגֹּל (nidgol) deserves a moment. Its root ד־ג־ל gives us דֶּגֶל (degel), a “banner” or “standard,” especially a military flag (cf. Numbers 2 and 10, where each tribe camps and marches “under its degel”). The form here is probably a *hitpael*‑like form (“we will banner ourselves”) but functionally means “we will march / rally under banners.”

What kind of banners? The prepositional phrase tells you: “in the name of our God” (וּבְשֵׁם־אֱלֹהֵינוּ). Rashi reads it as “we will assemble and gain strength.” Radak and Malbim imagine actual standards carried into battle with God’s name written on them. Either way, the idea is that the **visible symbol** of the army’s identity is not the king’s personal crest but God’s name.

The last line repeats and amplifies v. 5: “May the LORD fulfill (יְמַלֵּא) all your requests (מִשְׁאֲלוֹתֶיךָ).” So verses 5–6 form a little **triplet**:

- May He give what’s in your heart (inner desire).
- May He fulfill all your counsel (careful planning).
- May He fulfill all your requests (spoken prayers).

Liturgically, the phrase “יְמַלֵּא יְהוָה מִשְׁאֲלוֹת לִבֵּנוּ לְטוֹבָה” (“May the LORD fulfill the requests of our hearts for good”) in the monthly Birkat ha-Ḥodesh prayer is built out of this verse: it takes the royal language and applies it to everyone in the synagogue.

**Verse 7**

עַתָּה יָדַעְתִּי כִּי הוֹשִׁיעַ יְהוָה מְשִׁיחוֹ;  
יַעֲנֵהוּ מִשְּׁמֵי קׇדְשׁוֹ;  
בִּגְבֻרוֹת יֵשַׁע יְמִינוֹ׃  

“Now I know that the LORD has saved His anointed;  
He will answer him from His holy heavens,  
with the mighty victories of His right hand.”

This is the psalm’s hinge. עַתָּה (attah) means “now”—but here not just “at this point in time” but “now, on the basis of what we have just seen/heard.” יָדַעְתִּי is past/perfect (“I have come to know”). Grammarians sometimes call this usage the **“perfect of confidence”** or **prophetic perfect**: you describe a future certainty as if it’s already occurred.

The “I” is unnamed. Options:

- A **prophet** delivering an oracle of salvation in the middle of the liturgy.
- The **king himself**, testifying that he has received assurance.
- A **solo singer** speaking on behalf of the worshiping community.

Traditional Jewish commentators are deliberately non‑committal. Ibn Ezra says, “Each and every person will say thus, or these are the words of the poet with the holy spirit.” Radak: “Each and every one of Israel will say: ‘Now I know.’” Malbim imagines an actual report arriving mid‑service, prompting this cry.

“His anointed” (מְשִׁיחוֹ, meshicho) is key. The noun מָשִׁיחַ (mashiach) simply means “anointed one,” someone anointed with oil for office—usually a **king**, sometimes a high priest. Here it clearly refers to the Davidic king we’ve been praying for. The suffix “His” stresses ownership: the king isn’t a freelance tyrant; he belongs to YHWH.

Spatially, we’ve climbed from:

- מִקֹּדֶשׁ (“from the sanctuary,” v. 3),
- to מִצִּיּוֹן (“from Zion,” v. 3),
- to מִשְּׁמֵי קׇדְשׁוֹ (“from His holy heavens,” here).

The answer originates not in the building but in God’s own realm.

Finally, vivid divine‑warrior imagery: בִּגְבֻרוֹת יֵשַׁע יְמִינוֹ – literally, “with the mighty deeds of salvation of His right hand.” God’s **right hand** is a standard metaphor for His power. Think of the Song at the Sea:

> יְמִינְךָ יְהוָה נֶאְדָּרִי בַּכֹּחַ; יְמִינְךָ יְהוָה תִּרְעַץ אוֹיֵב׃ (Exod 15:6)  
> “Your right hand, O LORD, glorious in power; Your right hand, O LORD, shatters the enemy.”

So v. 7 says: I now know that the king’s survival and victory are not luck or clever tactics; they are the visible imprint of **God’s right hand** acting in history.

**Verse 8**

אֵלֶּה בָרֶכֶב וְאֵלֶּה בַסּוּסִים;  
וַאֲנַחְנוּ בְּשֵׁם־יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ נַזְכִּיר׃  

“These trust in chariots and these in horses;  
but we—in the name of the LORD our God we will invoke.”

Formally this is classic **antithetic parallelism**: the two halves state contrasting realities to make the point sharp.

- “These” (אֵלֶּה… וְאֵלֶּה) – deictic, pointing to generic other nations.
- “But we” (וַאֲנַחְנוּ) – emphatic contrast: not them; us.

רֶכֶב (rekhev) = chariotry; סוּסִים (susim) = horses. In the ancient Near East, that is your high‑tech strike force. Deuteronomy 17:16 forbids Israel’s king to “multiply horses,” precisely so he won’t rely on Egyptian‑style military buildup.

The controversial word is נַזְכִּיר (nazkir). It’s a Hif‘il form of זכר, which in various stems can mean “remember,” “mention,” “invoke,” or even “proclaim.” Rashi, connecting it with sacrificial language like מַזְכִּיר לְבוֹנָה (“he who burns/causes to be remembered incense,” Isa 66:3), takes it as “invoke in prayer and sacrificial worship.” Others (and the Greek Septuagint’s μεγαλυνθησόμεθα, “we will be magnified/boast”) hear “we will boast in the name of the LORD.”

Probably you don’t have to choose. In Hebrew religious culture, to “mention” God’s name is to **call on** Him, and that act of calling is also the thing you “boast in.” So the line says: their war‑confidence rides on iron and horseflesh; ours rides on **invoking God’s name**.

Theologically, this verse pairs almost perfectly with Psalm 33:16–17:

> אֵין־הַמֶּלֶךְ נוֹשָׁע בְּרֹב חָיִל…  
> שֶׁקֶר הַסּוּס לִתְשׁוּעָה…  
> “A king is not saved by great army…  
> The horse is a lie for salvation…”

Both psalms insist that conventional military power is a **שֶׁקֶר (“lie, illusion”)** when treated as ultimate security. That doesn’t mean you literally disband the cavalry; it means you refuse to **worship** it.

---

**Verse 9**

הֵמָּה כָּרְעוּ וְנָפָלוּ;  
וַאֲנַחְנוּ קַמְנוּ וַנִּתְעוֹדָד׃  

“They collapse and fall;  
but we rise and are strengthened.”

If verse 8 was the principle, verse 9 is the **outcome**. Note the same contrast pair: הֵמָּה (“they”) vs. וַאֲנַחְנוּ (“but we”).

The verbs for “them”:

- כָּרְעוּ (kar‘u) – “they have knelt / collapsed.” The root כרע can mean to kneel in worship or to buckle under weight. In Isaiah 46:2, it’s used of Babylon’s idols:  
  > קָרְסוּ כָרְעוּ יַחְדָּו…  
  > “They cower, they bow down together…”
- נָפָלוּ (naflu) – “they have fallen.”

Both are in perfect form, as if the collapse has already happened. Like v. 7, this is likely another **prophetic perfect**: the community is so sure of the outcome that they speak of the enemy’s defeat as a done deal.

For “us”:

- קַמְנוּ (qamnu) – “we have risen / stood up.” Antonym of נפל.
- וַנִּתְעוֹדָד (vanit‘odad) – a rare hitpael form from עוד. BDB glosses it as “be restored, strengthened.” The same root in a different stem appears in Psalms 146:9 and 147:6 of God as “one who raises up (מְעוֹדֵד) the lowly.” Here, the reflexive form suggests, “we find ourselves strengthened / restored to full stance.”

The sound also does some work. כָּרְעוּ וְנָפָלוּ has a falling rhythm with its final ‑u vowels; קַמְנוּ וַנִּתְעוֹדָד ends with a firm ‑ad, giving a sense of solidity. You can almost hear the clatter of armor as one side crashes and the thud of boots as the other regroups.

Malbim refuses to treat קַמְנוּ and וַנִּתְעוֹדָד as synonyms. For him, “we rose” = we survived the assault; “we were strengthened” = we went on to thrive beyond our previous state—in wealth, stability, and success. Whether you follow that or not, the verse clearly declares: **trust in God’s name produces not just survival but renewed strength**, while trust in weapons leads to humiliating collapse.

**Verse 10**

יְהוָה הוֹשִׁיעָה;  
הַמֶּלֶךְ יַעֲנֵנוּ בְיוֹם־קׇרְאֵנוּ׃  

“O LORD, save!  
May the King answer us on the day we call.”

The psalm ends by circling back to **petition**, but with a twist.

First line: יְהוָה הוֹשִׁיעָה (Adonai hoshia‘ah) – “O LORD, save!” The verb is an imperative with a softening יָה (“please” / “do it!”). This is the same root as יְשׁוּעָה (“victory/salvation”) in v. 6 and הוֹשִׁיעַ (“has saved”) in v. 7.

Second line: הַמֶּלֶךְ יַעֲנֵנוּ בְיוֹם־קׇרְאֵנוּ – literally, “the king will/ may answer us on the day we call.” Here’s the ambiguity: who is **“the king”**?

- Many traditional commentators (Ibn Ezra, Radak, Meiri) say: it’s God. Only God is truly “the King,” so you read it as two addresses to the same subject: “O LORD, save! O King, answer us…” In English you might supply the “O”: “O King, answer us…”
- Others, including some modern readers and Malbim in one of his explanations, take “the King” to be the **human king** we’ve been praying for. Then the sense is: “O LORD, save; may the king answer us when we call.” In other words, may our divinely saved king be responsive to his people.

Hebrew orthography and accents don’t settle it. The Masoretic accent (a disjunctive on הוֹשִׁיעָה) suggests a pause between “LORD, save!” and “the king will answer us…,” but doesn’t tell you whether “the king” is divine or human.

It might well be **intended to do both at once**. Throughout the psalm, the king is “His anointed,” the human through whom God’s saving power flows to the people. To say “the King will answer us” as you look at both God and His anointed is fully in line with biblical royal ideology (2 Sam 7:14: “I will be to him a father, and he shall be to Me a son”).

The phrase “on the day we call” (בְיוֹם־קׇרְאֵנוּ) answers back to v. 2’s “on a day of trouble” (בְּיוֹם צָרָה). At the start, the day is defined by **trouble** coming from outside; by the end, it is defined by **calling** coming from Israel. The core hope of the psalm is that whenever that day comes—battlefield fear, national crisis, personal pain—there will be an answering King.

No wonder this line became a go‑to cry in the prayerbook: it compresses the whole psalm’s theology into one sentence: **we are in trouble; we call; may the true King answer.**
