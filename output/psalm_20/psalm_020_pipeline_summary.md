## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (11)

1. What is the precise function of שֵׁם ('name') theology in Deuteronomistic literature, and how does Psalm 20's threefold use of 'name' relate to the centralization of worship and divine presence theology in Deuteronomy 12-26?
2. How does the perfect tense עַתָּה יָדַעְתִּי ('Now I know') in v. 7 function liturgically—does it suggest a moment of prophetic oracle reception similar to Ps 12:5, and what ancient Near Eastern parallels exist for such ritual assurance formulas?
3. Who is the speaker in v. 7—the king, a prophet, a priest, or the community collectively? What are the implications of each possibility for understanding the psalm's liturgical performance?
4. What is the historical and theological background of the prohibition against trusting in chariots and horses (vv. 8-9), and how does this psalm relate to texts like Deut 17:16, Isa 30:15-16, 31:1, and Hos 14:3?
5. How does the term מְשִׁיחוֹ ('His anointed') function in v. 7 within the broader Psalter, and what does it reveal about the relationship between YHWH's kingship and the Davidic king's role as covenant mediator?
6. What is the nature of the sacrifices mentioned in v. 4 (מִנְחֹתֶךָ and עוֹלָתְךָ)—are these specifically pre-battle offerings, and what rituals might have accompanied them based on other biblical texts?
7. Is there a deliberate ambiguity in v. 10 regarding 'the King' (הַמֶּלֶךְ)—could this refer to both YHWH and the human king simultaneously, and how does such wordplay function theologically?
8. How does the spatial movement from earthly sanctuary (מִקֹּדֶשׁ, v. 3) to heavenly sanctuary (מִשְּׁמֵי קׇדְשׁוֹ, v. 7) relate to ancient Israelite temple theology and the concept of the temple as axis mundi?
9. What is the significance of the military imagery 'mighty victories of His right arm' (בִּגְבֻרוֹת יֵשַׁע יְמִינוֹ) in v. 7, and how does this language function elsewhere in divine warrior texts?
10. How does Psalm 20 function intertextually with Psalm 21, which appears to be a post-battle thanksgiving for the king's victory—are they a liturgical pair?
11. What Ugaritic or broader ancient Near Eastern parallels exist for royal pre-battle liturgies, and how does Israel's theology of covenant relationship (rather than appeasement) distinguish this psalm from surrounding cultures?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (12)

1. Who is the 'I' who speaks in v.7 (עַתָּ֤ה יָדַ֗עְתִּי)—prophet, priest, king, or collective voice? What liturgical role does this speaker have?
2. Why does the psalm shift from addressing the king as 'you' (vv.2-6) to referring to 'his anointed' in 3rd person (v.7)? Is this a genre signal of prophetic oracle?
3. What is the precise function of נַזְכִּֽיר (nazkhir) in v.8—'remember,' 'invoke,' 'call upon,' 'boast in,' or 'proclaim'? How does this relate to זכר (remember) in v.4?
4. Is the syntactic ambiguity in v.10 (הַ֝מֶּ֗לֶךְ יַעֲנֵ֥נוּ) intentional theological wordplay allowing both 'O King' (YHWH) and 'may the king' (human) simultaneously?
5. What does נִדְגֹּ֑ל (nidgol) 'array banners' mean in v.6—literal military standards, cultic procession banners, or metaphorical 'exalt'?
6. Why these specific sacrifice types in v.4 (מִנְחֹתֶ֑ךָ meal offerings and עוֹלָתְךָ֖ burnt offerings)—are they standard pre-battle ritual?
7. What is the rare Hithpolel form וַנִּתְעוֹדָֽד (vanitoʿadad) doing in v.9—reflexive strengthening or passive being-strengthened? What theological agency is implied?
8. How does עַתָּ֤ה (atta) function in v.7—temporal 'now' (liturgical present moment) or logical 'therefore' (based on sacrifices/prayer)?
9. Why does the psalm move from 'name of Jacob's God' (v.2) to 'name of LORD our God' (v.8)—is this covenant name intensification significant?
10. What sound patterns are created by the Hebrew phonetics—are there alliterations or assonances that create rhetorical force?
11. Does the perfect tense in v.9 (כָּרְע֣וּ וְנָפָ֑לוּ קַּ֝֗מְנוּ וַנִּתְעוֹדָֽד) indicate battle already fought, or is this prophetic perfect expressing such confidence that future is described as past?
12. How does the spatial theology (sanctuary → Zion → heavenly sanctuary) relate to ancient Israelite temple cosmology and the concept of temple as axis mundi?
