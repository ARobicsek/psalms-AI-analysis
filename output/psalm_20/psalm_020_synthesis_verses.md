# Verse-by-Verse Commentary: Psalm 20

**Verse 1**

לַמְנַצֵּ֗חַ מִזְמ֥וֹר לְדָוִֽד׃

"For the choirmaster. A psalm of David."

The superscription employs the standard tripartite formula found throughout the Psalter, but the term לַמְנַצֵּ֗חַ (lamnatze'ach) remains one of the most enigmatic technical terms in biblical Hebrew. The root נצח carries semantic associations with endurance, pre-eminence, and victory—BDB notes its range from "be pre-eminent, enduring" to "act as overseer, superintendent, director." The participial form מְנַצֵּחַ appears 55 times in psalm superscriptions and in the Chronicles narrative of Levitical temple service (1 Chr 15:21, 23:4), suggesting a liturgical functionary responsible for musical performance.

The Septuagint's εἰς τὸ τέλος ("unto the end") reflects a reading לַמִּנְצָח, interpreting the term eschatologically—a move that influenced patristic exegesis but obscures the cultic setting. The evidence from Chronicles provides the strongest clue: these psalms likely derive from an earlier "Director's Collection," a major psalter compiled during the Second Temple period from which the final editor drew. Ibn Ezra treats the phrase as a performance instruction, while Radak's commentary simply notes the attribution to David without dwelling on the technical designation, following the midrashic tradition that connects David's authorship to his prophetic spirit.

The phrase מִזְמ֥וֹר לְדָוִֽד raises the familiar ambiguity of the lamed: "of David" (authorship), "for David" (dedication), or "concerning David" (subject matter). Given that vv. 2-6 address the king in second person while v. 7 shifts to third person reference to "His anointed" (מְשִׁיחוֹ), the superscription may signal a liturgical performance *for* (on behalf of) the Davidic king rather than *by* him. This reading aligns with Meiri's observation that the psalm was composed "to be recited by the Levites on [David's] behalf whenever he went out to war" (חברו דוד להיות הלויים אומרים אותו עליו בכל עת שיצא למלחמה). The superscription thus functions as a rubric, identifying the psalm's liturgical Sitz im Leben: a pre-battle intercession offered by the priestly or levitical establishment for the king's military success.

**Verse 2**

יַֽעַנְךָ֣ יְ֭הֹוָה בְּי֣וֹם צָרָ֑ה; יְ֝שַׂגֶּבְךָ֗ שֵׁ֤ם אֱלֹהֵ֬י יַעֲקֹֽב׃

"May the LORD answer you on a day of trouble; may the name of the God of Jacob keep you safe."

The opening volley consists of two jussive verbs establishing the psalm's petition-mode: יַֽעַנְךָ֣ (*ya'ankhā*, "may He answer you") and יְשַׂגֶּבְךָ֗ (*yəśaggēḇeḵā*, "may He protect you"). The verb ענה appears at critical structural junctures—here (v. 2), at the pivot (v. 7: יַעֲנֵהוּ, *ya'anēhū*, "He will answer him"), and at the climax (v. 10: יַעֲנֵנוּ, *ya'anēnū*, "may [the King] answer us")—creating an inclusio of divine response that frames the entire composition. The concordance reveals that ענה in the Qal frequently appears with God as subject in contexts of distress (e.g., Ps 3:5, 4:2, 17:6), making it standard petition vocabulary. Yet the threefold repetition with shifting pronouns (you/him/us) traces a theological arc from individual royal plea to communal confidence.

The phrase בְּי֣וֹם צָרָ֑ה (*bəyom tsarah*, "on a day of trouble") is formulaic military language. The term צָרָה denotes not general anxiety but concrete military threat—compare Ps 50:15: קְרָאֵנִי בְּיוֹם צָרָה ("Call upon Me in the day of trouble"), where deliverance from enemies is explicit. The second colon introduces the psalm's first "name theology" reference: שֵׁ֤ם אֱלֹהֵ֬י יַעֲקֹֽב (*šēm 'elōhē ya'aqōḇ*, "the name of the God of Jacob"). Here, שֵׁם functions not as mere designation but as hypostatized agent—the name itself performs the protective action expressed by the verb שׂגב (Piel: "set securely on high"). This is quintessential Deuteronomistic theology, where God's name becomes the locus of His localized presence while preserving His transcendence. Compare Deut 12:11: לְשַׁכֵּ֤ן שְׁמוֹ֙ שָׁ֔ם ("to cause His name to dwell there")—the Temple as dwelling-place not of God's essence but of His name.

Radak explains the choice of יַעֲקֹב over the patriarchal triad: "He said 'God of Jacob' because Jacob saw himself in troubles more than Abraham and Isaac" (אמר אלהי יעקב לפי שראה יעקב עצמו בצרות יותר מאברהם ויצחק). The midrash elaborates: just as Jacob was delivered from Laban and Esau despite overwhelming odds, so the king facing military crisis invokes the Jacob-paradigm. This exegetical move transforms covenant history into liturgical precedent—the psalm appeals not to Abraham's blessing or Isaac's binding but to Jacob's survival, the patriarch whose life was marked by צָרוֹת רַבּוֹת ("many troubles," Gen 35:3).

Modern Jewish liturgy preserves this verse's supplicatory force by incorporating it into the expanded Tachanun prayers on Mondays and Thursdays in both Ashkenazic and Sefardic rites, though adapted to first-person plural: יַעֲנֵנוּ יְהֹוָה בְּיוֹם צָרָה יְשַׂגְּבֵנוּ שֵׁם אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב ("May the LORD answer us in a day of trouble, may the name of the God of Jacob protect us"). This liturgical transformation democratizes the royal plea, turning the community itself into the endangered subject requiring divine intervention.

**Verse 3**

יִשְׁלַֽח־עֶזְרְךָ֥ מִקֹּ֑דֶשׁ; וּ֝מִצִּיּ֗וֹן יִסְעָדֶֽךָּ׃

"May He send your help from the sanctuary; and from Zion may He sustain you."

The verse articulates a precise spatial theology through its dual prepositional phrases: מִקֹּ֑דֶשׁ (*miqqōḏeš*, "from the sanctuary") and וּמִצִּיּוֹן (*ū-mitsiyōn*, "and from Zion"). Both employ the min-preposition denoting source or origin, specifying that divine aid emanates not merely *through* sacred space but actively *from* it. The term קֹדֶשׁ here functions as a construct form (literally "place of holiness") referring to the Holy of Holies where the ark resided, as Ibn Ezra notes tersely: ממקום הארון ("from the place of the ark"). Zion is not a second location but an appositive specification—the sanctuary *is* in Zion. The parallelism thus moves from the building's inner sanctum to its geographic locus, creating a zoom-out effect from ritual center to cosmic mountain.

The verb pair יִשְׁלַח (*yišlaḥ*, "may He send") and יִסְעָדֶךָּ (*yis'āḏeḵā*, "may He sustain") deserves attention. The root סעד, meaning "support, sustain, stay," appears in contexts of both physical nourishment (Gen 18:5, Judg 19:5: "sustain the heart" with food) and military reinforcement. Here the Qal form with ךָ- suffix creates the phonetic sequence yis-'ā-**DHEKH**-khā, where the guttural ayin and the velar fricative kh dominate, lending the line a throaty, emphatic quality that contrasts with the lighter sibilants of the first colon (yish-laḥ-'ez-**RKHĀ**). The military connotation is activated by the preceding עֶזְרְךָ (*'ezreḵā*, "your help"), a term frequently paired with warfare vocabulary—compare Ps 108:13: עֶזְרָת מִצָּר ("help against the adversary"), where military aid is explicit.

Radak emphasizes the theological logic: "For there is the Glory [i.e., God's manifest presence], and from there He will send your help in battle" (כי שם הכבוד, ומשם ישלח עזרך במלחמה). This reading treats the sanctuary not as symbolic but as operational—the locus from which God *actively deploys* assistance. Yet the verse also sets up a spatial trajectory that will reach its zenith in v. 7, where the origin shifts from the earthly sanctuary to מִשְּׁמֵי קָדְשׁוֹ (*miššəmê qoḏšô*, "His heavenly sanctuary"). The liturgy thus enacts a double movement: prayer ascends *to* the sanctuary (the people pray *toward* Jerusalem, per 1 Kgs 8:44-48), and divine aid descends *from* it. The Temple becomes the axis mundi, the vertical channel linking heaven and earth.

The concordance reveals that this verse's language appears almost verbatim in Ps 128:5, a pilgrimage blessing: יְבָרֶכְךָ יְהֹוָה מִצִּיּוֹן ("The LORD will bless you from Zion"). The formulaic nature suggests liturgical standardization—both psalms likely draw from a common stock of temple-centered petition language. Malbim, with his characteristic concern for precise distinctions, parses the verse's progression as intensification: even though the king is now distant from the Land of Israel, God will send aid from the sanctuary and *additionally* sustain him from Zion, offering both immediate help (שלח) and ongoing support (סעד). This reading treats the two verbs as stages of divine intervention rather than synonyms, a move typical of Malbim's anti-synonymy hermeneutic.

**Verse 4**

יִזְכֹּ֥ר כָּל־מִנְחֹתֶ֑יךָ; וְעֹ֥לָתְךָ֖ יְדַשְּׁנֶ֣ה סֶֽלָה׃

"May He remember all your meal offerings; and may He approve your burnt offering. Selah."

The sacrificial vocabulary anchors the liturgy in cultic reality. The verse employs two distinct offering types: מִנְחָה (*minḥah*, "meal offering") and עֹלָה (*'olah*, "burnt offering"). The meal offering, detailed extensively in Leviticus 2, consisted of fine flour mixed with oil and frankincense, with a portion burned on the altar while the remainder went to the priests. The burnt offering, by contrast, was entirely consumed by fire (hence עֹלָה, from עלה "to go up"—that which ascends in flame). The juxtaposition of these two categories creates a merism encompassing the full spectrum of acceptable sacrifice—grain and animal, partial and total, peaceful and expiatory.

The verb זכר in the petition יִזְכֹּר (*yizkōr*, "may He remember") carries profound covenantal weight. In biblical idiom, divine "remembering" is never passive recollection but active intervention. When God "remembers" Noah (Gen 8:1), the waters recede; when He "remembers" Rachel (Gen 30:22), her womb opens; when He "remembers" His covenant (Exod 2:24), the Exodus begins. Here, the object is כָּל־מִנְחֹתֶיךָ (*kol-minḥoteḵā*, "all your meal offerings")—the kol emphasizing comprehensiveness. God's remembering of past sacrifices becomes the basis for present deliverance, transforming cultic acts into juridical evidence of the king's piety.

The second colon introduces one of the psalm's most unusual lexical choices: יְדַשְּׁנֶ֣ה (*yəḏaššəneh*), from the root דשן, literally "make fat" or "find fat." BDB notes this is "unusual anthropomorphic language for divine response to sacrifice," since the idiom treats acceptance as a sensory experience—God "tastes" the fattiness of the offering and finds it satisfying. The Piel form intensifies the action: not merely "regard as fat" but actively "cause to be regarded as fat," i.e., accept favorably. Rashi interprets via the cognate verb in Deut 31:20: ודשן ("and it will grow fat"), glossing the psalm's usage as יְקַבְּלֵם בְּרָצוֹן כְּעוֹלוֹת מְחִים ("He will accept them willingly like fat burnt offerings"). The anthropomorphism is striking: God's favor is depicted through the culinary metaphor of savoring rich food.

Ibn Ezra reads the verse as conditional logic: "The meaning is, why will He help you? Because He will remember all your meal offerings" (פירוש למה יעזרך? כי יזכור כל מנחותיך). This construal makes sacrifice the *causa* of divine aid, dangerously close to quid pro quo theology. Yet the Deuteronomistic theology underlying the psalm resists such mechanistic readings—the sacrifices are not payment but signs of covenantal fidelity. Malbim, writing in a post-Temple era, spiritualizes entirely: the king cannot now offer sacrifices as was customary before battle, so God will "remember" past offerings, making the verse a plea for grace based on accumulated merit rather than present ritual performance.

The liturgical use of this verse is preserved only through its inclusion in the full recitation of Psalm 20 during weekday Shacharit (Ashkenazic and Sefardic) and as an introductory prayer for the penitential Yom Kippur Katan service. Its sacrificial specificity, while no longer directly applicable after 70 CE, is retained as a fossilized prayer form—a window into First Temple worship practice encoded in liturgical amber.

The enigmatic term סֶלָה (*selah*) appears here, one of only three occurrences in this psalm (also vv. 4, 10). Scholarly consensus remains elusive—perhaps a musical or cantillation instruction, perhaps a liturgical pause for congregational response, perhaps derived from סלל ("to lift up," thus "lift up [your voice]"). Regardless of etymology, its function is structural, marking a caesura that separates the sacrificial petition from the requests that follow. The pause creates dramatic space, allowing the imagery of rising smoke and divine satisfaction to linger before the liturgy proceeds to articulate the desired result: fulfillment of the king's plans.

**Verse 5**

יִֽתֶּן־לְךָ֥ כִלְבָבֶ֑ךָ; וְֽכׇל־עֲצָתְךָ֥ יְמַלֵּֽא׃

"May He grant you your heart's desire; and may He fulfill all your counsel."

The verse shifts from cultic vocabulary to psychological and strategic terminology. The phrase כִלְבָבֶךָ (*khilvāḇeḵā*, "according to your heart") is a standard idiom for one's innermost desire or wish—compare Ps 21:3: תַּאֲוַת לִבּוֹ נָתַתָּה לּוֹ ("You granted him his heart's desire"), where the parallel construction makes the meaning explicit. The preposition כְּ here functions prepositionally ("according to") or adverbially ("as"), yielding: "may He give you as your heart [wishes]." The verb נתן in the jussive (יִתֶּן) appears with God as subject in contexts of royal blessing—see Ps 2:8: שְׁאַל מִמֶּנִּי וְאֶתְּנָה ("Ask of Me, and I will give"), where divine giving is performative, world-altering speech.

The parallelism moves from interiority (לֵב, "heart") to deliberation (עֵצָה, "counsel/plan"). The root יעץ carries semantic range from private reflection to formal political consultation—Joseph's עֵצָה in Genesis 41 rescues Egypt, while Ahithophel's עֵצָה in 2 Samuel is political machination. Here, with כׇל־ prefixed ("all your counsel"), the term likely encompasses both: the king's personal strategic vision and the formal war-council's deliberations. The verb מלא in the Piel (יְמַלֵּא, *yəmallē'*, "may He fulfill") means literally "fill" or "make full"—God will bring the counsel to its full realization, filling it out to completion.

The double use of the root מלא in this verse (vv. 5-6) creates a structural link: וְכׇל־עֲצָתְךָ יְמַלֵּא ("and all your counsel may He fulfill") answered by יְמַלֵּא יְהֹוָה כׇּל־מִשְׁאֲלוֹתֶיךָ ("May the LORD fulfill all your petitions"). The repetition with chiastic word order (verb-object / subject-verb-object) reinforces the theme of totality—*kol* ("all") appears three times in vv. 5-6, and the verb מלא anchors both cola. This is not careless redundancy but rhetorical intensification: the psalm piles up synonyms for "fulfill completely" to emphasize comprehensiveness.

Radak's comment is illuminating: "For [the counsel is needed] because through strategizing you make war" (על דרך כי בתחבלות תעשה לך מלחמה, quoting Prov 24:6). The verse presupposes that military success requires both divine favor *and* human wisdom—the psalm does not advocate passivity but pious strategy. Yet Radak immediately cites a midrash that qualifies this: "David, because he was wholehearted before his Creator and prayed with a whole heart, they said to him: 'May He grant you according to your heart.' But to every other person we do not say this, for sometimes a person's heart contains [the desire] to steal or to commit transgression" (על ידי שהיה שלם לפני בוראו ובלב שלם מתפלל אליו, היו אומרים לו: יתן לך כלבבך; אבל לכל אדם אין אומרים כן, שפעמים שיש בלבו של אדם לגנוב או לעבור עברה). The exegesis recognizes the dangerous implication: what if the king's "heart's desire" is unjust? The midrash resolves the tension by limiting the blessing to David specifically, whose heart is presumed aligned with divine will.

Malbim, ever attentive to narrative reconstruction, reads the verse as uttered by the "troop of singers" who have just received news of David's miraculous deliverance. They declare: "May He grant you [what was] according to your heart"—i.e., David's *tā'ăwat lēḇ* (heart's longing) was for precisely this salvation, and it has now been granted. The fulfillment of the king's "counsel" refers to his strategic decision to trust in divine aid rather than military might—a reading that retroactively interprets v. 5 through the theological polemic of v. 8.

In Sefardic liturgy, a phrase from this verse—יְמַלֵּא יְהֹוָה—appears uniquely in the Birkat HaChodesh (Blessing of the New Month), where it anchors a petition for divine fulfillment of communal wishes: חַיִּים שֶׁיְּמַלֵּא יְהֹוָה מִשְׁאֲלוֹת לִבֵּנוּ לְטוֹבָה ("a life in which the LORD will fulfill the requests of our hearts for good"). The liturgical adaptation transforms the royal military plea into a monthly supplication for personal and collective blessing, demonstrating how the psalm's language transcended its original Sitz im Leben.

**Verse 6**

נְרַנְּנָ֤ה בִּ֘ישׁ֤וּעָתֶ֗ךָ; וּבְשֵׁם־אֱלֹהֵ֥ינוּ נִדְגֹּ֑ל; יְמַלֵּ֥א יְ֝הֹוָ֗ה כׇּל־מִשְׁאֲלוֹתֶֽיךָ׃

"May we shout for joy in your victory; and in the name of our God set up banners. May the LORD fulfill all your petitions."

The verse marks a striking pronominal shift: the first-person plural cohortative נְרַנְּנָה (*nəranənāh*, "let us shout") introduces the communal voice for the first time. The preceding verses employed second-person singular address (יעַנְךָ, יִשְׁלַח עֶזְרְךָ, יִזְכֹּר... מִנְחֹתֶיךָ, יִתֶּן־לְךָ, etc.), maintaining focus on the individual king. Now the liturgy incorporates the congregation: "we will shout," "our God," creating a moment of collective identification with the royal cause. This is not incidental but theologically programmatic—the king's triumph becomes the people's celebration, and the people's God becomes the king's protector. The interdependence is deliberate: monarchy functions liturgically as the nexus between divine power and national welfare.

The root רנן carries connotations of jubilant, loud cry—often translated "shout for joy" or "sing aloud." The phonetic structure nə-ran-**NNĀH** foregrounds the doubled nun, creating a nasal resonance that, when voiced, produces a humming or ringing sound. This is onomatopoetic: the phonetic character mimics the jubilation it describes. The preposition ב here is causal ("because of" or "on account of"): we shout *because of* your victory, not merely *about* it. The term יְשׁוּעָה (*yəšū'ah*, "victory/salvation") is the first of four occurrences of the root ישׁע in this psalm (vv. 6, 7 [twice], 10), saturating the text with salvation semantics and tying it to the divine name יְהוָה (from the root הוה, "to be").

The second colon introduces the hapax verb נִדְגֹּל (*niḏgōl*), from the root דגל. This is the *only* occurrence of דגל as a verb in the Hebrew Bible. The noun דֶּגֶל means "banner" or "standard"—the military ensign under which troops assemble (Num 1:52, 2:2ff.). The Qal form would mean "carry a banner" or "march under a standard," but here we have the Hithpael, suggesting reflexive or reciprocal action: "we will array ourselves under banners" or "we will set up standards." The phrase וּבְשֵׁם־אֱלֹהֵינוּ (*ū-ḇəšēm 'elōhênū*, "in the name of our God") modifies the verb: the banners will be raised *in the name* of our God, meaning either (1) literally inscribed with the divine name, or (2) idiomatically, raised *by invoking* or *proclaiming* the divine name.

The interpretive options are revealing. Rashi glosses: נִתְאַסֵּף וְנַעֲשֶׂה חַיִל ("we will assemble and become strong")—reading the verse as a call to military mobilization rather than liturgical celebration. Ibn Ezra understands it as future-oriented triumph: "We will raise our banner when the LORD fulfills all your requests" (ירום דגלינו בעת שימלא השם כל משאלותיך)—the jubilation is conditional upon victory, not yet realized. Radak, by contrast, reads the banners as metaphorical: "In His name we will lift up our standard and our ensign" (בשמו נרים נסנו ודגלנו), treating דגל as synonymous with נס, both terms for "banner" or "sign."

Malbim's interpretation is the most theologically loaded. He construes the verse as articulating the king's (or the community's) deliberate strategy: "In the name of our God we will set up banners" (בשם אלהינו נדגל). This is not post-battle celebration but pre-battle declaration. When we raise our military standards, we will inscribe them with the divine name, signaling that YHWH Himself is our commanding general. The banner becomes a visible theological statement—a polemic *in re* (in the thing itself) against the chariotry and cavalry of v. 8, which rely on material weaponry. The psalm thus anticipates its own climactic antithesis.

The verse concludes with a third jussive petition: יְמַלֵּא יְהוָה כׇּל־מִשְׁאֲלוֹתֶיךָ (*yəmallē' YHWH kol-miš'ălōṯeḵā*, "May the LORD fulfill all your petitions"). This is nearly verbatim repetition of the second half of v. 5 (וְכׇל־עֲצָתְךָ יְמַלֵּא), with only the object changed from עֵצָה ("counsel") to מִשְׁאֲלוֹת ("petitions/requests"). The root שׁאל, meaning "ask" or "request," appears here in its nominal form, emphasizing the king's dependence—his plans require not just formulation (עֵצָה) but divine ratification (מִשְׁאָלוֹת granted). The repetition of the verb מלא creates a refrain effect, hammering home the theme of divine fulfillment through syntactic and lexical recurrence.

Liturgically, this verse appears in an unusual pairing in the Sefardic *Zemirot* for *Melaveh Malka* (the post-Shabbat meal), where vv. 10 and 6 are juxtaposed: יְהוָה הוֹשִׁיעָה הַמֶּלֶךְ יַעֲנֵנוּ בְיוֹם־קָרְאֵנוּ׃ נְרַנְּנָה בִּישׁוּעָתֶךָ וּבְשֵׁם־אֱלֹהֵינוּ נִדְגֹּל יְמַלֵא יְהוָה כָּל־מִשְׁאֲלוֹתֶיךָ׃ The reversal of biblical order (v. 10 before v. 6) creates a petition-then-confidence sequence: "O LORD, save!"—answered by—"May we shout for joy in Your salvation." This liturgical reordering transforms the psalm into a programmatic statement of trust as the new week begins.

**Verse 7**

עַתָּ֤ה יָדַ֗עְתִּי כִּ֤י הוֹשִׁ֥יעַ יְהֹוָ֗ה מְשִׁ֫יח֥וֹ; יַ֭עֲנֵהוּ מִשְּׁמֵ֣י קׇדְשׁ֑וֹ; בִּ֝גְבֻר֗וֹת יֵ֣שַׁע יְמִינֽוֹ׃

"Now I know that the LORD will give victory to His anointed; He will answer him from His heavenly sanctuary with the mighty victories of His right arm."

The pivot. The verse marks the liturgy's dramatic turning point through its opening particle עַתָּה (*'attāh*, "now"). This is not merely temporal but epistemic: "now" signals the shift from petition to confidence, from jussive to declarative, from *request* to *knowledge*. The verb יָדַעְתִּי (*yāḏa'tî*, "I have come to know") is a perfect form, expressing completed action in contrast to the preceding string of jussives (may He answer, may He send, may He remember, may He grant). The perfect tense here functions as a "prophetic perfect" or "perfect of confidence"—the outcome is so certain it is narrated as already accomplished.

The identity of the "I" who speaks is the psalm's central interpretive crux. The pronoun shifts abruptly: verses 2-6 addressed the king directly as "you" (יַעַנְךָ, יְשַׂגֶּבְךָ, עֶזְרְךָ, מִנְחֹתֶיךָ, לְךָ כִלְבָבֶךָ), then incorporated the congregation as "we" (v. 6: נְרַנְּנָה, וּבְשֵׁם־אֱלֹהֵינוּ). Now a singular voice declares יָדַעְתִּי ("I know"), and the king is referred to in third person: מְשִׁיח֥וֹ (*məšîḥô*, "His anointed"). Who is this "I"?

Option 1: A prophetic voice. The sudden shift suggests an oracle moment—a cultic prophet receiving divine assurance mid-liturgy and interrupting the petition with a declaration of certainty. Compare Ps 12:6, where a divine oracle interrupts the human complaint: עַתָּה אָקוּם יֹאמַר יְהוָה ("Now I will arise, says the LORD"). The formula עַתָּה + perfect verb + כִּי clause is characteristic of prophetic speech introducing a divine utterance or inspired announcement (see also Exod 18:11, 1 Sam 12:17, 2 Kgs 5:15).

Option 2: A representative individual speaking on behalf of the community. Ibn Ezra proposes: "Each and every person will say thus, or these are the words of the psalmist with the holy spirit" (דברי כל אחד כן ידברו או הם דברי המשורר ברוח הקדש). Radak echoes this: "Each and every person of Israel will say: Now I know" (יאמר כל אחד ואחד מישראל: עתה ידעתי). This reading democratizes the oracle, making the prophetic insight communally available.

Option 3: The king himself. Malbim's historical reconstruction is ingenious: the psalm reflects the moment when David, fighting far from Jerusalem, was miraculously delivered, and messengers arrived in Jerusalem with news of the victory *while* the congregation was still praying for him. The "I" is thus the congregation's representative who receives the report and interrupts the liturgy: "Now I know" (that God has saved His anointed). This reading treats the psalm as a liturgical *script* memorializing an actual historical moment.

The shift to third-person reference—מְשִׁיחוֹ (*məšîḥô*, "His anointed")—is equally significant. The term derives from the root משׁח ("anoint"), referring to the ritual anointing with oil that consecrates kings (1 Sam 10:1, 16:13), priests (Exod 29:7), and prophets (1 Kgs 19:16). Here it clearly designates the Davidic monarch, as evidenced by the parallel in v. 10 (הַמֶּלֶךְ, "the King"). The term appears in royal contexts throughout the Psalter (Ps 2:2, 18:51, 28:8, 84:10, 89:39, 132:10), always signifying the covenant mediator through whom divine power flows to the nation. Yet the possessive suffix—"*His* anointed"—underscores that the king belongs to YHWH; he is not autonomous but divinely commissioned.

The verse's second colon introduces vertical spatial movement: יַעֲנֵהוּ מִשְּׁמֵי קָדְשׁוֹ (*ya'anēhū miššəmê qoḏšô*, "He will answer him from His heavenly sanctuary"). This directly parallels v. 3 (יִשְׁלַח־עֶזְרְךָ מִקֹּדֶשׁ, "He will send your help from the sanctuary"), but the spatial origin has *ascended*. The earlier petition envisioned aid emanating from the earthly Temple; now the declaration locates the source in מִשְּׁמֵי קָדְשׁוֹ—literally, "from the heavens of His holiness" or "His holy heavens." This is not a contradiction but a theological intensification: the earthly sanctuary is the terrestrial footprint of the celestial throne-room. The dual-sanctuary theology appears elsewhere in royal psalms (e.g., Ps 11:4: יְהוָה בְּהֵיכַל קׇדְשׁוֹ יְהוָה בַּשָּׁמַיִם כִּסְאוֹ, "The LORD is in His holy temple; the LORD's throne is in the heavens").

The verse concludes with a classic instance of divine warrior imagery: בִּגְבֻרוֹת יֵשַׁע יְמִינוֹ (*biḡəḇurōṯ yēša' yəmînô*, "with the mighty victories of His right hand"). The term גְּבוּרָה denotes martial prowess, military might—see Exod 15:6, the Song of the Sea: יְמִינְךָ יְהוָה נֶאְדָּרִי בַּכֹּחַ יְמִינְךָ יְהוָה תִּרְעַץ אוֹיֵב ("Your right hand, O LORD, glorious in power; Your right hand, O LORD, shatters the enemy"). The "right hand" (יָמִין) is a standard metonym for divine power—God does not possess a literal appendage, but the image anthropomorphizes His intervention using the body part associated with strength, skill, and favor (cf. Ps 18:36, 44:4, 60:7, 108:7, 118:15-16). The plural construct גְּבֻרוֹת יֵשַׁע ("mighty acts of salvation") suggests repeated, varied interventions—not one victory but many, not a single deliverance but an ongoing pattern of divine aid.

The liturgical reuse of this verse is telling. In the Edot HaMizrach rite, it appears within the Mussaf Amidah for the Shalosh Regalim (Three Pilgrimage Festivals) on the second day, where it is embedded in a scriptural mosaic celebrating divine might: לְךָ זְרוֹעַ עִם־גְּבוּרָה תָּעֹז יָדְךָ תָּרוּם יְמִינֶךָ. עַתָּה יָדַעְתִּי כִּי הוֹשִׁיעַ יְהוָה מְשִׁיחוֹ יַעֲנֵהוּ מִשְּׁמֵי קָדְשׁוֹ בִּגְבֻרוֹת יֵשַׁע יְמִינוֹ ("Yours is an arm with might; Your hand is strong, Your right hand is exalted. Now I know that the LORD gives victory to His anointed..."). The liturgical placement transforms the royal military oracle into a celebration of God's redemptive power over all oppressors, making the psalm's historical particularity serve a universal theological claim.

**Verse 8**

אֵ֣לֶּה בָ֭רֶכֶב וְאֵ֣לֶּה בַסּוּסִ֑ים; וַאֲנַ֓חְנוּ בְּשֵׁם־יְהֹוָ֖ה אֱלֹהֵ֣ינוּ נַזְכִּֽיר׃

"They [call] on chariots, they [call] on horses; but we call on the name of the LORD our God."

The verse constructs an elaborate antithetical parallelism through its demonstrative pronouns and contrastive syntax: אֵלֶּה... וְאֵלֶּה... וַאֲנַחְנוּ (*'ēlleh*... *wə'ēlleh*... *wa'ănaḥnû*, "these... and these... but we"). The tripartite structure creates a rhetorical us-versus-them that is both stark and comprehensive—"these" rely on military hardware, "we" rely on the divine name. The demonstrative אֵלֶּה functions deictically, pointing to an implied external referent (enemy nations, rival kingdoms) without naming them, which universalizes the polemic. The particle ו before אֲנַחְנוּ is adversative ("but"), sharpening the contrast.

The military vocabulary is precise and deliberate. The term רֶכֶב (*reḵeḇ*, "chariot") and סוּסִים (*sûsîm*, "horses") represent the ancient Near Eastern military standard—chariots were the equivalent of modern armor, combining speed, mobility, and shock value, while cavalry provided tactical flexibility. Egypt, Assyria, and later Babylon fielded massive chariot forces. The Deuteronomistic royal law explicitly prohibits the Israelite king from multiplying horses: לֹא־יַרְבֶּה־לּוֹ סוּסִים וְלֹא־יָשִׁיב אֶת־הָעָם מִצְרַיְמָה לְמַעַן הַרְבּוֹת סוּס ("He shall not multiply horses for himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt in order to multiply horses," Deut 17:16). The prohibition is theologically motivated—horses symbolize self-reliance and alliance with Egypt, the paradigm of idolatrous power. Isaiah's polemic is even more explicit: הוֹי הַיֹּרְדִים מִצְרַיִם לְעֶזְרָה עַל־סוּסִים יִשָּׁעֵנוּ וַיִּבְטְחוּ עַל־רֶכֶב כִּי רָב וְעַל פָּרָשִׁים כִּי־עָצְמוּ מְאֹד וְלֹא שָׁעוּ עַל־קְדוֹשׁ יִשְׂרָאֵל וְאֶת־יְהוָה לֹא דָרָשׁוּ ("Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help and rely on horses, who trust in chariots because they are many and in riders because they are very strong, but do not look to the Holy One of Israel or seek the LORD," Isa 31:1). Hosea demands Israel renounce such alliances: אַשּׁוּר לֹא יוֹשִׁיעֵנוּ עַל־סוּס לֹא נִרְכָּב ("Assyria will not save us, we will not ride on horses," Hos 14:4).

The verb נַזְכִּיר (*nazkhîr*, "we invoke/mention/remember") is deliberately chosen for its ambiguity. The Hiphil form of זכר can mean (1) "remember" or "call to mind" (cognitive), (2) "invoke" or "call upon" (liturgical), (3) "mention" or "proclaim" (verbal), or even (4) "boast in" or "extol" (celebratory). Rashi glosses it as prayer and sacrifice: "We will invoke, an expression of burning [incense] and prayer, as in 'he who burns (מַזְכִּיר) frankincense' (Isa 66:3)" (נַזְכִּיר לְשׁוֹן הַקְטָרָה וּתְפִלָּה, כְּמוֹ מַזְכִּיר לְבוֹנָה). This reading treats נזכיר as technical cultic vocabulary, linking invocation with ritual action. Ibn Ezra offers no comment, allowing the verb's semantic range to stand unresolved. Radak understands it as straightforward invocation: "When we mention His name and call upon Him, we will triumph" (כשנזכיר שמו ונקראהו אנחנו ננצח). But the Septuagint's μεγαλυνθησόμεθα ("we will magnify [ourselves]" or "we will be made great") suggests an alternate Vorlage or interpretation that leans toward the sense of "boast" or "take pride in"—not an invocation *toward* God but a proclamation *about* God.

The phrase בְּשֵׁם־יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ (*bəšēm-YHWH 'ĕlōhênû*, "in the name of the LORD our God") is the psalm's third and climactic "name theology" reference (after v. 2, שֵׁם אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב, and v. 6, וּבְשֵׁם־אֱלֹהֵינוּ). The progression is deliberate:
1. v. 2: שֵׁם אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב ("name of the God of Jacob") — patriarchal promise
2. v. 6: בְשֵׁם אֱלֹהֵינוּ ("in the name of our God") — communal relationship
3. v. 8: בְּשֵׁם־יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ ("in the name of the LORD our God") — full covenant formula with the Tetragrammaton

The final formulation combines the personal divine name יְהוָה (Yahweh) with the possessive אֱלֹהֵינוּ ("our God"), creating an intimate yet covenantal designation. This is the Shema's language: שְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ יְהוָה אֶחָד ("Hear, O Israel: The LORD is our God, the LORD is One," Deut 6:4). The verse asserts that Israel's military confidence derives not from technological superiority but from covenantal relationship—the "name" functions as the locus of divine presence and power, and to invoke that name is to deploy the ultimate weapon.

The psalm's polemic finds its most powerful echo in Psalm 33:16-17, a text so closely related to Psalm 20 that they may have been composed or compiled as a deliberate pair:

אֵין־הַמֶּלֶךְ נוֹשָׁע בְּרׇב־חָיִל גִּבּוֹר לֹא־יִנָּצֵל בְּרׇב־כֹּחַ. שֶׁקֶר הַסּוּס לִתְשׁוּעָה וּבְרֹב חֵילוֹ לֹא יְמַלֵּט.

"A king is not saved by a mighty army; a warrior is not delivered by great strength. A horse is a false hope for salvation; despite its great strength, it does not deliver."

The Psalm 33 passage calls military hardware שֶׁקֶר (*šeqer*, "falsehood" or "delusion")—not merely ineffective but ontologically deceptive, a lie about what constitutes real power. The concordance reveals this is the only occurrence of the phrase שֶׁקֶר הַסּוּס ("the horse is a lie") in the Hebrew Bible, making Psalm 33's polemic uniquely explicit. Both psalms share this theological core: conventional military strength is pseudo-salvation, and true deliverance derives from YHWH alone.

For a small vassal kingdom like Judah, constantly threatened by imperial neighbors (Assyria, Babylon, Persia), this theology was not spiritual abstraction but geopolitical strategy. Israel *could not* compete with the chariot armies of the great powers; the psalm reframes this weakness as theological virtue. By declaring reliance on the divine name rather than military hardware, the liturgy transforms Israel's material disadvantage into covenantal fidelity. This is what Walter Brueggemann calls "countertestimony"—the assertion of an alternative reality in defiance of observable power structures.

**Verse 9**

הֵ֭מָּה כָּרְע֣וּ וְנָפָ֑לוּ; וַאֲנַ֥חְנוּ קַּ֝֗מְנוּ וַנִּתְעוֹדָֽד׃

"They collapse and lie fallen; but we rally and gather strength."

The verse completes the antithetical parallelism initiated in v. 8 through a contrasting sequence of verbs depicting the divergent fates of "them" (הֵמָּה, the enemies who trust in chariots and horses) and "us" (וַאֲנַחְנוּ, those who invoke the divine name). The fourfold verb structure creates a dramatic tableau: two verbs of downward motion (כָּרְעוּ, "they kneel/collapse," and וְנָפָלוּ, "and they fall") answered by two verbs of upward motion (קַמְנוּ, "we rise," and וַנִּתְעוֹדָד, "and we stand firm"). The chiastic motion—down-down / up-up—visualizes the theological claim: their power collapses, ours endures.

The first verb כָּרְעוּ (*kārə'û*) derives from the root כרע, meaning "bend the knee," "bow down," or "collapse." In cultic contexts it describes prostration in worship (Ps 95:6: בֹּאוּ נִשְׁתַּחֲוֶה וְנִכְרָעָה, "Come, let us worship and bow down"); in military contexts it depicts defeat or submission. The participial form כֹּרֵעַ in Judges 7:5-6 describes soldiers drinking by kneeling. Here the military connotation dominates—the image is of an army whose legs give way, whose ranks buckle. The second verb וְנָפָלוּ (*wənāp̄ālû*, "and they fall") is standard battlefield vocabulary. The concordance search reveals only *one* other biblical occurrence of the exact pair כָּרְעוּ וְנָפָלוּ: Isaiah 46:2, where the Babylonian gods Bel and Nebo are depicted as collapsing under the weight of their own idols: קָרְסוּ כָרְעוּ יַחְדָּו לֹא יָכְלוּ מַלֵּט מַשָּׂא ("They cower, they bow down together; they cannot rescue the burden"). The intertextual echo is potent: what happens to false gods in Isaiah happens to those who trust in horses and chariots in Psalm 20. Both texts deploy the verb pair to signify total, humiliating defeat.

The tense of the verbs demands attention. Both כָּרְעוּ and נָפָלוּ are *perfect* forms, not jussives or cohortatives. This creates a jarring temporal paradox: the psalm has been petitioning for future victory (may He answer, may He send, may He grant), yet now it describes the enemy's defeat as already accomplished. This is the so-called "prophetic perfect" or "perfect of confidence"—a verb form that narrates future events as completed because the outcome is regarded as so certain that it is effectively *fait accompli*. The same tense appears in prophetic oracles announcing judgment (Isa 5:13: גָּלָה עַמִּי מִבְּלִי דָעַת, "My people go into exile [have gone] for lack of knowledge"). Here the prophetic perfect functions rhetorically: the declaration of confidence (v. 7: עַתָּה יָדַעְתִּי, "Now I know") is so absolute that the battle's outcome can be described in past tense even though it lies in the future.

The contrastive second colon begins with the emphatic pronoun וַאֲנַחְנוּ (*wa'ănaḥnû*, "but we"), echoing v. 8's adversative structure. The verb קַּמְנוּ (*qāmnû*, "we have risen") is the antonym of נפל—to rise up, stand up, arise. In military contexts קום often describes rallying after defeat (Amos 5:2: לֹא־תוֹסִיף קוּם, "She will rise no more"), but here it suggests resilience in the face of assault: we do not collapse but *rise up* to meet the threat. The final verb וַנִּתְעוֹדָֽד (*wanniṯ'ôḏāḏ*) is the verse's lexical prize—a rare Hithpolel form of the root עוד, appearing only here in the Psalter. BDB glosses the Hithpolel as "be restored, strengthened," citing this verse as its sole example in that stem. The root עוד generally means "return," "repeat," or "do again," but in intensive/reflexive forms it suggests self-restoration or renewal. The Polel participle מְעוֹדֵד appears in Ps 146:9 (יְהוָה... מְעוֹדֵד עֲנָוִים, "The LORD... raises up the downtrodden") and 147:6 (מְעוֹדֵד עֲנָוִים יְהוָה, "The LORD raises up the humble"), where it describes God's action of lifting the oppressed. Here the Hithpolel makes the action reflexive or resultative: "we stand ourselves up firmly" or "we become strengthened/restored." The Septuagint renders it ἀνωρθώθημεν ("we were set upright"), capturing the sense of being made to stand firm.

The phonetic pattern of the verse foregrounds the "fall vs. rise" contrast. The verbs kā-rə-**'Ū** wə-nā-**FĀ**-lū create a falling cadence with the stressed syllables on the final u-vowels, followed by the rising cadence of **QQAM**-nū wan-nith-'ō-**DHĀDH**, where the q-consonant's emphatic quality and the d-ending give a sense of solidity and resolution. The soundscape performs the meaning: descent followed by ascent.

Malbim's interpretation treats the verse as describing *two* distinct victories: (1) They collapse and fall—the military defeat of the enemy; (2) We rise and become strengthened—not merely military triumph but increased prosperity and national vigor (*ביתר ענינים בעושר והצלחה*). This reading refuses to treat קמנו and נתעודד as synonyms, insisting (per his anti-synonymy hermeneutic) that each verb contributes distinct semantic content. To rise is to recover from prostration; to be strengthened is to surpass one's former state.

The verse's theology is audacious: it makes the *outcome* of battle depend not on armaments but on *whom* you invoke. The liturgical context is crucial—this is not a battlefield taunt but a cultic declaration made *before* combat, transforming military confidence into an act of worship. By speaking the enemy's defeat in the past tense, the liturgy performatively claims the future, enacting in language what it hopes to see in history.

**Verse 10**

יְהֹוָ֥ה הוֹשִׁ֑יעָה; הַ֝מֶּ֗לֶךְ יַעֲנֵ֥נוּ בְיוֹם־קׇרְאֵֽנוּ׃

"O LORD, save! May the King answer us on the day we call."

The psalm concludes with a syntactically ambiguous petition that has generated significant exegetical debate. The Hebrew הַמֶּלֶךְ (*hamMeleḵ*, "the King") with the definite article can be parsed in two ways: (1) as a vocative addressing God ("O King, answer us"), or (2) as the subject of the verb ("May the king answer us"). The ambiguity centers on whether הַמֶּלֶךְ refers to the divine King (YHWH) or the human king (the Davidic monarch for whom the psalm intercedes). The Masoretic accentuation (the זָקֵף קָטֹן on הוֹשִׁיעָה) creates a disjunctive pause, separating יְהוָה הוֹשִׁיעָה ("LORD, save!") from הַמֶּלֶךְ יַעֲנֵנוּ ("May the King answer us"), which *suggests* two distinct subjects. But syntax alone does not resolve the question.

Ibn Ezra notes both readings, preferring the vocative: "הַמֶּלֶךְ is God, who is truly King" (המלך הוא השם שהוא המלך באמת). This interpretation treats the verse as a double petition to the same divine subject: "O LORD, save! O King, answer us!" Radak agrees: "The meaning of 'the King' is God, who is King of the universe, and it is in His hand to save us" (פרוש המלך: האל, שהוא מלך העולם, ובידו להושיענו). Both medieval commentators reflexively read הַמֶּלֶךְ as a divine epithet, likely influenced by the theological axiom that only God is the true sovereign (cf. Ps 47:3: כִּי מֶלֶךְ גָּדוֹל יְהוָה עַל־כׇּל־הָאָרֶץ, "For the LORD is a great King over all the earth").

Yet the alternate reading—that הַמֶּלֶךְ refers to the human king—has strong contextual support. The entire psalm has interceded *for* the king (vv. 2-6 address him as "you"), and v. 7 refers to him in third person as מְשִׁיחוֹ ("His anointed"). It would be natural for the liturgy to conclude by petitioning that this same king answer the people's call when *they* face distress. Malbim proposes a historical reconstruction: the congregation prays "O LORD, save!" (יְהוָה הוֹשִׁיעָה), and they receive an answer from the human king David, who responds by declaring his trust in divine deliverance alone (as expressed in vv. 8-9). This reading treats the psalm as a dialogue, with the final verse capturing the interplay between communal petition and royal response.

The most intriguing possibility is that the ambiguity is *deliberate*—a poetic double entendre that allows both meanings to coexist. In ancient Israelite ideology, the Davidic king is YHWH's earthly representative, the mediator through whom divine power flows to the nation (2 Sam 7:14: אֲנִי אֶהְיֶה־לּוֹ לְאָב וְהוּא יִהְיֶה־לִּי לְבֵן, "I will be to him a father, and he will be to Me a son"). To petition the king for deliverance *is* to petition God, because the king's authority derives from YHWH's covenant. The verse collapses the distinction between divine and royal agency, making the king's response an extension of God's salvation. This theological fusion is precisely what the psalm has been asserting: the anointed king is the human locus of divine deliverance (v. 7: הוֹשִׁיעַ יְהוָה מְשִׁיחוֹ, "the LORD saves His anointed"). The verse's syntactic ambiguity thus becomes *theological* wordplay, blurring the boundary between heavenly and earthly kingship.

The phrase בְיוֹם־קׇרְאֵֽנוּ (*bəyôm-qorə'ēnū*, "on the day we call") creates an inclusio with v. 2's opening בְּיוֹם צָרָה (*bəyom tsarah*, "on a day of trouble"). Both phrases employ the construct בְּיוֹם ("on a day of") to specify the temporal occasion of divine response. The progression from צָרָה ("trouble/distress") to קׇרְאֵֽנוּ ("our calling") subtly reframes the crisis: what began as a "day of trouble" imposed by external threat becomes a "day of calling" characterized by Israel's vocalized petition. The shift emphasizes human agency—the day is defined not by what the enemy does but by what *we* do: we call, and therefore God (or His anointed) will answer. The verb קרא in the Qal means "call," "cry out," or "proclaim," and with God as indirect object it denotes prayer or invocation (e.g., Ps 4:2: בְּקׇרְאִי עֲנֵנִי, "When I call, answer me"; Ps 50:15: קְרָאֵנִי בְּיוֹם צָרָה, "Call upon Me in the day of trouble"). The psalm thus ends where it began—with the verb ענה ("answer")—but the pronominal objects have shifted:
- v. 2: יַעַנְךָ יְהוָה ("May the LORD answer *you*" [the king])
- v. 7: יַעֲנֵהוּ ("He will answer *him*" [the anointed])
- v. 10: יַעֲנֵנוּ ("May [the King] answer *us*" [the people])

The threefold repetition with shifting pronouns creates a network of mutual intercession: the people pray for the king, the king intercedes for the people, and both address the divine King. The verb ענה thus functions as the psalm's structural spine, appearing at beginning, middle, and end to frame the composition as a liturgy of *answerability*—a ritual articulation of the hope that prayer *will* be met with response.

The verse's liturgical afterlife demonstrates its potency as a climactic petition. It appears ubiquitously in Jewish prayer:
1. As the third verse in the liturgical triad following *Uva L'Tzion* (daily and Shabbat/Festival Mincha), where it completes the sequence: יְהֹוָה צְבָאוֹת עִמָּנוּ... יְהֹוָה צְבָאוֹת אַשְׁרֵי אָדָם בֹּטֵחַ בָּךְ... יְהֹוָה הוֹשִׁיעָה הַמֶּלֶךְ יַעֲנֵנוּ בְיוֹם קָרְאֵנוּ ("The LORD of hosts is with us... LORD of hosts, happy is the man who trusts in You... O LORD, save! May the King answer us on the day we call").
2. As a crucial introductory verse to the Neilah service on Yom Kippur, framing the final prayers of the day with an urgent plea for a favorable decree.
3. In the Selichot for public fast days in Ashkenazic tradition, where it anchors a series of penitential verses.
4. In expanded Pesukei Dezimra on Shabbat and Festivals across all rites, often paired unusually with v. 1 (the superscription) to create the invocation: יְהוָה הוֹשִׁיעָה הַמֶּלֶךְ יַעֲנֵנוּ בְיוֹם־קָרְאֵנוּ. לַמְנַצֵּחַ מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד ("O LORD, save! May the King answer us on the day we call. For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David").

This extraordinary liturgical saturation demonstrates that the verse became a freestanding petition-formula, detached from its original psalm-context and deployed whenever the liturgy requires a powerful plea for divine intervention. The NJPS translation captures the urgency: "O LORD, grant victory! / May the King answer us when we call." The verse's final position in the psalm makes it a summarizing petition, a distillation of all preceding requests into a single cry for salvation *now*, *today*, *on the day we call*.

The psalm thus concludes not with confident declaration (as in v. 9) but with renewed petition, circling back to the mode of supplication with which it began. This is a liturgical choice: even after asserting "Now I know" (v. 7) and proclaiming the enemy's defeat (v. 9), the liturgy does not presume upon God but returns to humble plea. The final verse reminds both pray-er and listener that confidence in divine deliverance must always be accompanied by the act of *calling*—the vocalized petition that activates the covenantal relationship. Victory belongs to those who invoke the Name (v. 8), but invocation must be continuous, urgent, and sincere: "on the day we call."
