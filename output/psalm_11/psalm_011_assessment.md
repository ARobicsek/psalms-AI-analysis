# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 11

The existing introduction and commentary are already thoughtful and well‑informed. They capture the psalm’s dramatic tension between the counsel to flee and the decision to trust, and they handle the central cruxes—“foundations” in v. 3, the double location of God in v. 4, divine “testing” in v. 5, and the Sodom imagery in v. 6—with solid philological and traditional grounding. The prose is generally lucid, the use of Radak, Meiri, and others is judicious, and the overall thesis—that the psalm reframes the question from human action to divine vision—is compelling.

That said, several weaknesses keep it from excellence. The liturgical section in the introduction is truncated and thin; it does not exploit the rich data in the research bundle about how phrases from vv. 6–7 live in Sukkot prayers, seliḥot, and a Purim *krovetz*. More broadly, the introduction under‑uses the “Related Psalms” and figurative language parallels: Psalm 64’s nearly parallel archery‑in‑darkness scene, Psalm 7’s similar bow and arrow imagery, and Psalm 36’s “YHWH in heaven” and “upright of heart” motifs are noted only obliquely if at all. The verse commentary, although detailed, sometimes repeats the introduction rather than extending it; it could sharpen its literary analysis (parallelism, inclusio, the mutual “beholding” of vv. 4 and 7) and draw more explicit connections to other biblical uses of the same images, always with Hebrew quotations.

The tone occasionally drifts toward dissertation‑speak—terms like “bicolon,” “hendiadys,” and “metallurgical” appear without definition—and the technicalities of ketiv/qere, verb forms, and ANE temple theology could be made more accessible without oversimplifying. Some good rabbinic material—especially the Torah Temimah’s use of our verses in Sanhedrin 26a (Hezekiah and Shebna)—is absent from the introduction and barely appears in the notes. Finally, the central question raised by the macro‑analysis—how Psalm 11 stands in conversation with other trust psalms—is not really answered.

The revision below keeps the strengths—the basic thesis, much of the exegetical substance—but reorganizes the introduction, deepens the intertextual and liturgical dimensions, trims repetition, defines technical terms, and lets the verse‑by‑verse commentary do more of the philological and literary heavy lifting, with ample Hebrew and English quotations.
