      "What is the textual issue in v. 1b with the ketiv נודו versus qere נוּדִי? Does the feminine singular imperative address נֶפֶשׁ (soul) as feminine, or is there a scribal issue? How does this affect translation and interpretation?",
      "What are the 'foundations' (הַשָּׁתוֹת) in v. 3? Is this architectural (temple/city), cosmic (earth's foundations), social (justice system), or moral (ethical order)? How is this root used elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible, and what would 'destroyed foundations' signify to ancient Israelites?",
      "How does the dual location in v. 4—'temple' (הֵיכַל) and 'throne in heaven'—relate to temple theology and divine presence? Does this reflect simultaneous immanence/transcendence, or is 'heavenly throne' a description of the earthly temple as microcosm of heaven? Compare ancient Near Eastern temple cosmology.",
      "The imagery in v. 6 (fire, sulfur, scorching wind) clearly echoes Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen 19:24). How does this intertextual connection function rhetorically? Does the 'raining down' verb (מטר) deliberately invert blessing to curse? Are there other biblical or ancient Near Eastern parallels to divine judgment as anti-rain?",
      "What is the significance of 'beholding His face' (יֶחֱזוּ פָנֵימוֹ) in v. 7b given the tension with Exod 33:20 ('no one can see My face and live')? Is this cultic (seeing God in temple worship), eschatological (future beatific vision), or metaphorical (experiencing divine favor)? How do other Psalms use 'seeing God's face' language?",
      "The verb בחן (test/examine) in vv. 4-5 suggests metallurgical refining. How does this testing language relate to wisdom literature (Job, Proverbs) and to other Psalms? Is YHWH's testing of the righteous (v. 5a) positive (purification) or neutral (examination)? What is being tested?",
      "How does the 'refuge' language (חָסִיתִי, v. 1a) connect to temple asylum practices in ancient Israel? Are there legal/cultic dimensions to 'taking refuge in YHWH'? Compare other Psalms using this root (חסה) and consider whether this psalm reflects an actual asylum seeker at the temple being counseled to flee.",
      "The contrast between the wicked shooting 'from darkness' (בְּמוֹ־אֹפֶל, v. 2) and God's comprehensive vision (v. 4) creates an epistemological theme. How does darkness/light function theologically in Psalms and wisdom literature? Is darkness moral (ignorance of divine observation), epistemological (inability to see), or both?",
      "The phrase 'upright in heart' (יִשְׁרֵי־לֵב, v. 2) and 'upright' (יָשָׁר, v. 7) frames the description of the righteous. How does יָשָׁר relate to צַדִּיק (righteous)? Are these synonyms, or do they emphasize different aspects of moral character (straightness/integrity vs. righteousness)?",
      "How does Psalm 11's structure and themes relate to other 'trust' psalms (e.g., Psalms 4, 16, 23, 27, 62)? Are there common features (declaration of trust, description of threat, affirmation of divine protection)? Does Psalm 11's emphasis on divine examination and judgment distinguish it from other trust psalms?"

      "Why does v.4 use the specific body-part 'eyelids' (עַפְעַפָּיו) rather than just 'eyes'—what does this unusual anthropomorphism contribute?",
      "How should we understand God's 'testing' (בחן) of the righteous in v.5—is this positive (refining), neutral (examination), or threatening (trial)?",
      "What is the function of the unusual prefix בְּמוֹ in 'בְּמוֹ־אֹפֶל' (v.2), and how does it differ from simple בְּ?",

      "How does the psalm's promise that 'the upright shall behold His face' (v.7) relate to the prohibition in Exod 33:20 that no one can see God's face and live?",
      "Is the plural צְדָקוֹת in v.7 abstract intensity ('righteousness') or concrete plurality ('righteous deeds'), and what theological difference does this make?",
      "Why does the psalm leave the central rhetorical question of v.3 ('what can the righteous do?') syntactically unanswered?",
