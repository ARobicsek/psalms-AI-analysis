# Editorial Assessment (College Edition) - Psalm 11

The existing introduction and commentary are intellectually strong: they know the Hebrew very well, bring in classical commentators intelligently, and notice real poetic features (the darkness vs. divine vision contrast; the Sodom echo; the testing language; the unresolved question in v. 3). For a graduate seminar, this would already be solid work.

For a first‑year college student, though, there are problems:

- **Jargon load.** Terms like “epistemological binary,” “bicolon,” “ontological,” “theodicy,” “typological,” “anthropomorphism” appear with little or no explanation. A very capable student could follow, but will be working too hard just to decode the vocabulary.
- **Density and pacing.** Long, clause-heavy sentences and frequent digressions into lexica (BDB) and secondary debates slow the reading and bury the main line of the psalm’s argument.
- **Missed teaching moments.** Some great bits in the research bundle are underused:  
  – The vivid midrash Rashi cites (the flax worker) is mentioned but could be unpacked more;  
  – The Torah Temimah’s Sanhedrin passage tying our psalm to Shebna/Hezekiah is not integrated;  
  – The related psalms (7, 36, 58, 64) are noted in the RAG but not really used to show patterns.  
- **Liturgical section** is incomplete and does not quote the actual prayers; students who know the siddur will want to *see* how the psalm’s phrases live liturgically.
- **Tone.** The tone is more like a published article than a conversation with a bright undergrad: not much direct engagement (“Notice how…”) or concrete analogies.

The revisions should therefore: (1) keep the good close reading, but explain every technical term; (2) simplify and clarify sentences; (3) foreground the drama and structure of the psalm; (4) integrate key rabbinic and liturgical pieces with actual Hebrew + English quotations; (5) use related psalms selectively to show how Ps 11 fits a broader pattern of “trust under pressure.”
