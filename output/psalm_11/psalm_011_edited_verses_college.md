### Verse 1

**לַמְנַצֵּחַ לְדָוִד; בַּיהוָה חָסִיתִי; אֵיךְ תֹּאמְרוּ לְנַפְשִׁי: נ֝וּדִי הַרְכֶם צִפּוֹר.**

“**For the leader. Of David.**  
In the LORD I have taken refuge;  
how can you say to me:  
‘Flee to your mountain, bird!’”

The opening superscription, **“לַמְנַצֵּחַ לְדָוִד”**, tags this as a Davidic psalm “for the conductor/choirmaster,” i.e., meant for public performance.

The first real line is already a punch: **“בַּיהוָה חָסִיתִי” – “In the LORD I have taken refuge.”** The verb חָסִיתִי (root חסה) is a perfect form, suggesting a **completed decision**: “I have taken shelter and I’m staying there.” In many psalms, this verb hints at temple‑asylum: think of someone grabbing the “horns of the altar” (1 Kgs 1:50) to avoid being killed. So this isn’t abstract spirituality; it’s as concrete as hiding in a church during a riot.

Immediately that stance is challenged: **“אֵיךְ תֹּאמְרוּ לְנַפְשִׁי” – “How can you say to my soul…?”** The “you” is plural. It could be friends, advisers, or (as Radak suggests) enemies pretending to give advice. The phrase “לְנַפְשִׁי” literally means “to my *nefesh*.” In biblical Hebrew, *nefesh* is your life/self, often grammatically feminine. That helps explain the next word.

We hit a famous **ketiv/qere** issue here. *Ketiv/qere* means “what is written / what is read” when the medieval Masoretes preserved two traditions:

- **Ketiv (written):** נוּדוּ – “flee, all of you” (plural imperative).  
- **Qere (read aloud):** נוּדִי – “flee!” (feminine singular imperative), as if speaking directly to the *nefesh*.

Most printed Bibles follow the **qere**, which fits well: “How can you say to my soul: ‘Flee (you, my soul) to your mountain, bird!’” Radak nicely combines them: the written form hints that both body and soul are in danger; the read form highlights the soul as the inner decision‑maker.

The simile “**צִפּוֹר** – bird” is a bit mocking. The advisers are basically saying, “You’re like a little bird—defenseless prey—so just fly away.” In other psalms, the isolated bird image marks deep vulnerability: “כְּצִפּוֹר בּוֹדֵד עַל־גָּג” – “like a lone bird on a roof” (Ps 102:8).

Traditional commentators often anchor this in David’s life. Meiri imagines the moment after David saved the people of **Ke’ila** (1 Sam 23), only to learn they planned to hand him over to Saul. No wonder some voices said, “רוץ להר”—“just run to the hills.”

But the psalmist’s first line already signaled his refusal: he is not going to let fear—or even very rational-sounding counsel—override the fact that his **real** refuge is not the geography of Judah but the presence of God.

### Verse 2

**כִּי הִנֵּה הָרְשָׁעִים יִדְרְכוּן קֶשֶׁת; כּוֹנְנוּ חִצָּם עַל־יֶתֶר; לִירוֹת בְּמוֹ־אֹפֶל לְיִשְׁרֵי־לֵב.**

“For see, the wicked bend the bow;  
they have set their arrow on the string,  
to shoot in the dark at the upright of heart.”

This verse is the advisers’ **evidence** for why flight is the only sane option. It’s a vivid archery scene.

“**כִּי הִנֵּה…**” – “For look!”—a classic Hebrew way to say “Face the facts.” Then three verbs:

1. **יִדְרְכוּן קֶשֶׁת** – “they bend the bow.” The root דרך here is the *technical* verb for treading down a stiff bow with your foot to string it.
2. **כּוֹנְנוּ חִצָּם עַל־יֶתֶר** – “they have set their arrow on the string.” *כּוֹנְנוּ* (from כון) suggests *careful positioning*. The “יֶתֶר” is the bowstring.
3. **לִירוֹת** – “to shoot.”

You can almost hear the twang.

The threat is intensified by location: **“בְּמוֹ־אֹפֶל” – “in deep darkness.”** The little form *בְּמוֹ* is a poetic variant of *בְּ* (“in”), giving a slightly weightier feel. *אֹפֶל* is not just “night” but thick gloom; the same word can describe the underworld or a place of danger.

The targets are “**לְיִשְׁרֵי־לֵב** – the upright of heart.” This phrase shows up a handful of times in Psalms (7:11; 32:11; 64:11; 94:15; 97:11). It stresses inner alignment: *yashar* = straight, *lev* = mind/heart as decision center. Psalm 7:11 calls God “מושׁיע יִשְׁרֵי־לֵב” – “savior of the upright of heart,” which almost answers Psalm 11:2 in advance.

There’s a strong echo here with **Psalm 64**, where enemies:

> “דָּרְכוּ חִצָּם דָּבָר מָר; לִירֹת בַּמִּסְתָּרִים תָּם”  
> “aim their arrows—bitter words—to shoot from ambush at the blameless” (Ps 64:4–5).

In both psalms, wicked people use the **cover of darkness or secrecy** as their main weapon, and the righteous are described with “straightness” language (*תם*, *ישרי־לב*).

So verse 2 is not exaggeration; it’s a **type‑scene** of persecution in the psalter. The advisers are saying: this is that situation. The wicked have already drawn the bow. You’re outgunned and outmaneuvered. Don’t be stupid—run.

The psalmist, however, will argue that darkness only hides things from *other humans*. From God’s point of view (v. 4), nothing is “off‑camera.”

### Verse 3

**כִּי הַשָּׁתוֹת יֵהָרֵסוּן; צַדִּיק מַה־פָּעָל.**

“For when the foundations are destroyed,  
what can the righteous do?”

This line is the **emotional peak** of the advisers’ speech. It’s what all the archery talk is building toward.

We’ve already noted that **“הַשָּׁתוֹת”** probably means “foundations,” from שׁית (“to set, place”). It’s a rare word; the main other candidate is Isaiah 19:10, where *שתותיה* may refer to the economic or social “foundations” of Egypt being smashed.

So what “foundations” might the advisers have in mind?

- On a **cosmic** level: the God‑built structures that make a moral world possible.
- On a **social** level: the people and institutions meant to uphold justice—priests, wise judges, reliable allies.
- On a very **specific** level (Rashi/Metzudat David): the priests of Nov, or other “tzaddikim, יסודי עולם – righteous ones, foundations of the world,” who have just been killed.

Meiri, thinking of David at Ke’ila, paraphrases: “You’ve saved these people, and now they repay you by betraying you. If even your ‘foundations’—those who should have your back—turn against you, what’s left?”

Then comes the question: **“צַדִּיק מַה־פָּעָל”**.

Hebrew students naturally want to parse the grammar, and here it’s actually meaningful:

- *צַדִּיק* – could be “a righteous person,” or “the righteous one” (maybe David himself, maybe God).
- *מַה־פָּעָל* – literally “what he has done,” but as you know the perfect can also be used in rhetorical questions as “what can he do?”

Commentators split:

- Rashi: David is defending himself—“I, the righteous one, what have I done? You (Doeg, Saul, etc.) will bear the guilt, not I.”
- Many modern readers: this is existential despair—“When the structures of justice are gone, righteousness doesn’t matter; the righteous is **powerless**.”

The psalm itself treats the line as a **genuine dilemma.** It doesn’t give a human‑strategy answer (no “organize, resist, build new institutions”). Instead, it responds by changing the frame: you’ve been thinking only about what righteous people can do down here; let’s look at what the **righteous God** is doing from above (vv. 4–7).

### Verse 4

**יְהוָה בְּהֵיכַל קׇדְשׁוֹ; יְהוָה בַּשָּׁמַיִם כִּסְאוֹ; עֵינָיו יֶחֱזוּ; עַפְעַפָּיו יִבְחֲנוּ בְּנֵי אָדָם.**

“The LORD is in His holy temple;  
the LORD—His throne is in heaven.  
His eyes behold; His eyelids test human beings.”

This is the **turning point** of the psalm. Instead of answering “what can the righteous do?”, the poet asserts **where God is and what God is doing.**

The double phrase “בְּהֵיכַל קׇדְשׁוֹ / בַּשָּׁמַיִם כִּסְאוֹ” plays on temple theology:

- *הֵיכַל קׇדְשׁוֹ* – “His holy palace/temple.” In many psalms this points to the earthly temple in Jerusalem.
- *בַּשָּׁמַיִם כִּסְאוֹ* – “in the heavens is His throne.”

Ibn Ezra flattens them together: “His holy temple *is* the heavens.” Others, like Radak, are happy to keep a tension: God really does have His throne “up there,” yet His presence is also focused “down here” in the temple. In ancient Near Eastern thought, temples were **cosmic junction points**—miniature heavens planted on earth.

In any case, God is not hiding in the mountains or pacing the palace, nervous. The very verbs used of the wicked’s plotting (“they bend…they set…they shoot”) are now matched by verbs of God’s **calm, searching gaze**:

- “עֵינָיו יֶחֱזוּ” – “His eyes *behold*.” The verb חזה is stronger than just “see”: it can mean “see with insight,” as prophets *ḥōzeh* “seers.”
- “עַפְעַפָּיו יִבְחֲנוּ” – “His eyelids *test*.”  

  The noun “עַפְעַפַּיִם” (eyelids) appears only in poetry. Here it contributes a striking picture: God squints, as it were, to scrutinize closely. The verb *בָּחַן* (“to test, examine”) is the one used for refining metals (e.g., “וּבְחַנְתִּים כִּבְחֹן הַזָּהָב” – “I will test them as one tests gold,” Zech 13:9).

So in place of **“darkness”** in v. 2, we get God’s forensic spotlight. The wicked think no one will see: “מִי יִרְאֶה־לָּמוֹ?” – “Who will see us?” (Ps 64:6). Psalm 11’s answer is: **God will. Always.**

There’s also a nice inclusio with the end of the psalm. Here, God’s eyes behold people; in verse 7, **“יָשָׁר יֶחֱזוּ פָנֵימוֹ” – “the upright will behold His face.”** The final mutual gaze is already foreshadowed here.

### Verse 5

**יְהוָה צַדִּיק יִבְחָן; וְרָשָׁע וְאֹהֵב חָמָס שָׂנְאָה נַפְשׁוֹ.**

“The LORD tests the righteous;  
but the wicked and the lover of violence His soul hates.”

This verse applies verse 4’s “testing gaze” to two different human types.

First half: **“יְהוָה צַדִּיק יִבְחָן.”**

- You can read it as “The LORD **[who is] righteous** tests [people],” or “The LORD **tests the righteous [person].**”
- In either case, the key verb is again *יִבְחָן*—the metallurgist’s verb. God tries the righteous as a smith tries gold.

Rashi’s flax‑worker parable is worth savoring, because it captures a very human question: why do good people suffer? He imagines God saying:

> When the flax worker knows his flax is good, he beats it more; if it’s poor quality, he barely hits it, or it falls apart. So too, God “beats” the righteous with tests because He knows they can endure and become something stronger.

Metzudat David is very clear: David’s being chased by Saul is **not** a sign of guilt—“מַה שֶׁאֲנִי נִרְדָּף מִשָּׁאוּל לֹא הוּא בַּעֲבוּר הָעָוֹן”—it is simply God’s way of refining him.

Second half: **“וְרָשָׁע וְאֹהֵב חָמָס שָׂנְאָה נַפְשׁוֹ.”**

The grammar is compressed: literally, “and the wicked and lover of violence—His soul hates.” The subject of “hates” is God; “נַפְשׁוֹ” is an anthropomorphic way to talk about God’s inner being, His deepest will and desire.

Why such strong language?

- **“רָשָׁע”** on its own could mean someone who does wrong.  
- Adding **“וְאֹהֵב חָמָס”** turns it into a character portrait: this person *loves* violence, exploitation, crooked dealing.

*חָמָס* is the word used to describe the pre‑Flood earth: “וַתִּמָּלֵא הָאָרֶץ חָמָס” – “the earth was filled with violence” (Gen 6:11). It often appears in prophets complaining about injustice (Hab 1:2–3).

So the verse draws a sharp line:

- The **righteous** are tested, like strong flax or precious metal, and eventually vindicated.  
- The **violence‑lover** is fundamentally incompatible with the righteous God. God’s very “soul” (speaking metaphorically) rejects them.

This sharp contrast prepares for the storm imagery of v. 6, which shows what that hatred of violence looks like in historical time.

### Verse 6

**יַמְטֵר עַל־רְשָׁעִים פַּחִים; אֵשׁ וְגָפְרִית; וְרוּחַ זִלְעָפוֹת מְנַת כּוֹסָם.**

“He will rain down upon the wicked snares;  
fire and sulfur;  
and a scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.”

This is one of those Old-Testament-is-metal moments.

The main verb **יַמְטֵר** (Hifil of מטר) usually describes God blessing the land with rain. Here God “rains” something very different:

- **פַּחִים** – a tricky word. In most places *פַּח* is a “snare, bird‑trap” (Ps 124:7). Rashi, however, reads it here as *פֶּחָמִים* (“coals, charcoal”), and Ibn Ezra connects it with “רִקֻּעֵי פַחִים” (Num 17:3), hammered metal plates, “like burning stones.” Either way, it contributes to the sense of **deadly stuff falling from the sky**.
- **אֵשׁ וְגָפְרִית** – “fire and sulfur” is straight out of the Sodom story (Gen 19:24). *גָּפְרִית* (sulfur) appears only a handful of times, always in contexts of **total destruction**.
- **רוּחַ זִלְעָפוֹת** – the noun *זַלְעָפָה* is rare; in Lam 5:10 it describes “זַלְעֲפוֹת רָעָב” – the “burning heat of famine.” The phrase here is likely “a scorching, raging wind,” maybe alluding to the hot desert wind (like a sirocco) that can ruin crops and health.

So we get a nightmare weather report: **booby‑trapped hailstones, fire‑sulfur storm, killer wind.**

The last phrase, **“מְנַת כּוֹסָם” – “the portion of their cup,”** zooms back to metaphor. Your *מָנָה* is your allotted share, your *כּוֹס* is your life‑cup—your fate, in biblical idiom. Psalm 75:9 pictures a cup of divine judgment in God’s hand that the wicked must drink “עַד דְּרָעִים”—“down to the dregs.”

Put together: what the “lover of violence” (v. 5) has been pouring out on others comes back to them as their own cup to drink.

Notice too the contrast with the **righteous person’s cup** in other psalms:

- “יְהוָה מְנָת־חֶלְקִי וְכוֹסִי” – “The LORD is my portion and my cup” (Ps 16:5).  
- “כּוֹס־יְשׁוּעוֹת אֶשָּׂא” – “I raise the cup of salvations” (Ps 116:13).

Psalm 11 holds both possibilities side by side: refuge (v. 1) and storm‑cup (v. 6). Which cup you drink is determined by whether you are a *צַדִּיק* or an *אֹהֵב חָמָס*.

### Verse 7

**כִּי־צַדִּיק יְהוָה; צְדָקוֹת אָהֵב; יָשָׁר יֶחֱזוּ פָנֵימוֹ.**

“For the LORD is righteous;  
He loves righteous deeds;  
the upright shall behold His face.”

This final verse is like a compressed theological summary of the whole psalm.

1. **“כִּי־צַדִּיק יְהוָה” – “For the LORD is righteous.”**  

   The “כִּי” here gives a reason: why will the storm fall on the guilty and not on the righteous? Because God **Himself** is *צַדִּיק*. Deut 32:4 says something similar in a longer form: “צַדִּיק וְיָשָׁר הוּא” – “He is righteous and upright.”

2. **“צְדָקוֹת אָהֵב” – “He loves *צְדָקוֹת*.”**  

   The plural *צְדָקוֹת* is probably not just an abstract plural (“great righteousness”) but **concrete acts**: just judgments, fair dealings, defending the oppressed. Radak reads it as “אִישׁ צְדָקוֹת” – “a man of righteous deeds.” The idea isn’t just that God is just in Himself, but that He **takes delight** when humans practice justice.

   This quietly corrects an easy mistake: thinking that trust in God = passivity. The psalm has said the righteous person doesn’t need a clever escape plan, but verse 7 insists the righteous person still **does things**—*צְדָקוֹת*—and God loves that.

3. **“יָשָׁר יֶחֱזוּ פָנֵימוֹ” – “the upright shall behold His face.”**  

   The subject “יָשָׁר” can be read as collective: “the upright [ones].” The verb *יֶחֱזוּ* repeats the same root חזה used of God’s eyes in v. 4. There, God’s eyes “behold” (*יֶחֱזוּ*) humanity; here, the upright “behold” (*יֶחֱזוּ*) God’s face. It’s a **reciprocal vision**.

   How literal is this? Given Exodus 33:20’s “no human can see My face and live,” most traditional readers take it metaphorically:

   - **Radak** relates it to Lev 26:9, “וּפָנִיתִי אֲלֵיכֶם” – “I will turn My face toward you,” i.e., show favor, hear prayer.
   - Others (and many modern readers) see a hint of **ultimate** encounter—that whatever “testing” and waiting happen now, the end is an unclouded, intimate knowledge of God.

Either way, it’s important that the psalm ends here, not at verse 6. The last word is not sulfur but **seeing**. The movement from verse 1 (“I take refuge in the LORD”) to verse 7 (“the upright will behold His face”) traces the arc from **hiding with God** to **meeting God**.

The advisers asked, “When the foundations crumble, what can a righteous person do?” Psalm 11’s answer is subtle: the righteous person doesn’t win by superior tactics; they endure under the gaze of the righteous God, keep doing righteous deeds, and are finally rewarded not just with safety, but with **face‑to‑face nearness** to the One who has seen them all along.
