      "commentary": "The opening declaration 'בַּֽיהֹוָ֨ה ׀ חָסִ֗יתִי' (in YHWH I take refuge) uses the divine name emphatically at the beginning, creating strong positional emphasis. The quotation that follows 'אֵ֭יךְ תֹּאמְר֣וּ לְנַפְשִׁ֑י' (how can you say to my soul) is puzzling—who is speaking to whom? The textual variant (נודו/נוּדִי) creates ambiguity: ketiv has plural imperative, qere has feminine singular. The simile 'flee like a bird to your mountain' is vivid but raises questions about whether 'your mountain' is singular or plural in intent.",

The phrase 'בְּמוֹ־אֹ֝֗פֶל' (in darkness/in gloom) is curious—the prefix בְּמוֹ is unusual. Target is 'לְיִשְׁרֵי־לֵֽב' (to the upright of heart)—why 'upright of heart' rather than just 'upright'?

The rhetorical question 'צַ֝דִּ֗יק מַה־פָּעָֽל' (the righteous, what has he done/what can he do?) is grammatically ambiguous—perfect tense פָּעָֽל could be past action ('what has he done [to deserve this]?') or potential ('what can he do?').
