**Verse 1**

לַמְנַצֵּחַ לְדָוִד; בַּיהוָה חָסִיתִי; אֵיךְ תֹּאמְרוּ לְנַפְשִׁי, נוּדִי הַרְכֶם צִפּוֹר׃  

“For the leader. Of David. In YHWH I have taken refuge; how can you say to my soul, ‘Flee to your mountain, bird!’”

The superscription “לַמְנַצֵּחַ לְדָוִד” (“for the choirmaster, of David”) situates the poem within the Davidic repertoire used in temple worship. The psalm truly begins with “בַּיהוָה חָסִיתִי” – “In YHWH I have taken refuge.” The verb חָסָה is one of the Psalter’s signature words for trust. It likely has roots in the practice of asylum: someone pursued by blood‑vengeance could seize the altar and claim sanctuary (cf. 1 Kgs 1:50). Many psalms use the same phrase: “YHWH my God, in You I have taken refuge” (יְהוָה אֱלֹהַי בְּךָ חָסִיתִי, Ps 7:2); “In You, YHWH, I have taken refuge, let me never be shamed” (Ps 71:1). It signals not a pious feeling but a decisive move: the speaker has already chosen God as his place of safety.

This declaration is hurled back against someone else’s advice. “אֵיךְ תֹּאמְרוּ לְנַפְשִׁי” – “How can you say to my *nefesh*?” *Nefesh* in biblical Hebrew is not an immaterial “soul” but the living self, the seat of appetite and desire. The advisers are addressing his deepest instincts: survive, run.

The crux lies in the imperative “נוּדִי הַרְכֶם צִפּוֹר.” The consonantal text writes נודו (“flee, all of you”), but the traditional reading is נוּדִי (“flee, O my [feminine] self”), agreeing with נֶפֶשׁ. The root נוּד, as in Cain’s “fugitive and wanderer” (נָע וָנָד, Gen 4:12), denotes restless, homeless movement. Radak notes the ketiv/qere and suggests that the “written” form hints at both body and soul being driven away, while the “read” form focuses on the soul as the true addressee.

“הַרְכֶם” is “your mountain” – either the physical stronghold where David might hide or, more generally, a place of imagined security. The metaphor that follows, “צִפּוֹר” (“bird”), grammatically appositive (“flee … your mountain, *bird*”), supplies the sting. Birds in the psalms often stand for defenselessness: “I am like a lone bird on a roof” (Ps 102:8), “Do not give over Your dove to the wild beast” (אַל־תִּתֵּן לְחַיַּת נֶפֶשׁ תּוֹרֶךָ, Ps 74:19). Here the advisers reduce the righteous person to prey.

Meiri, with his eye on 1 Samuel, reads “your mountain” historically as the Judean wilderness to which David repeatedly flees—“how could you say to my soul, ‘Flee to your mountain, bird,’” when David has already taken refuge in God? The Septuagint, the ancient Greek translation, interestingly makes the speaker himself the subject: “I said to the Lord, ‘In You I am trusting; how will you say to my soul, “Migrate to the mountain like a sparrow”?’” (μεταναστεύω ἐπὶ τὸ ὄρος ὡς στρουθίον). Whether the counsel comes from friends or from inner fear, the dynamic is the same: faith answers prudence. The psalm’s drama begins with this collision: an already‑chosen refuge and a new invitation to run.

**Verse 2**

כִּי הִנֵּה הָרְשָׁעִים יִדְרְכוּן קֶשֶׁת; כּוֹנְנוּ חִצָּם עַל־יֶתֶר; לִירוֹת בְּמוֹ־אֹפֶל לְיִשְׁרֵי־לֵב׃  

“For look, the wicked bend the bow; they have set their arrow on the string, to shoot in deep darkness at the upright of heart.”

Verse 2 voices the content of the advisers’ fear. The interjection כִּי הִנֵּה (“for behold!”) is a standard way of summoning attention to imminent danger. “The wicked” (הָרְשָׁעִים) are not generic sinners but active enemies of the moral order—a stock figure in the Psalms.

The description of their preparations is remarkably precise. יִדְרְכוּן קֶשֶׁת, from דרך (“to tread”), is the technical verb for bending a strong bow by placing one’s foot upon it. Rashi explains: “When [the bow] is strong, one must place his foot on it when he wishes to bend it.” כּוֹנְנוּ חִצָּם עַל־יֶתֶר – “they have set their arrow on the string” – portrays the moment after the bow is drawn and the arrow is fixed on the taut cord (יֶתֶר). The perfect כּוֹנְנוּ paints the danger as already fully prepared.

Their purpose is “לִירוֹת בְּמוֹ־אֹפֶל לְיִשְׁרֵי־לֵב” – “to shoot in deep darkness at the upright of heart.” The preposition בְּמוֹ is a poetic variant of בְּ; אֹפֶל refers to thick gloom, a word associated with secrecy and calamity. Job calls Sheol “a land of deep darkness” (אֶרֶץ עֵיפָתָה כְּמוֹ אֹפֶל, Job 10:22); Psalm 91 speaks of “pestilence that walks in darkness” (מִדֶּבֶר בָּאֹפֶל, Ps 91:6). Our psalm’s darkness is the cover under which assassins operate.

The target, “the upright in heart” (יִשְׁרֵי־לֵב), recurs in a cluster of psalms that praise those whose inner orientation is straight: “My shield is God, the savior of the upright of heart” (Ps 7:11); “Let all the upright of heart glory” (Ps 64:11); “Your righteousness [extend] to the upright of heart” (Ps 36:11). The heart (לֵב) in biblical anthropology is not primarily the seat of emotion but of thought and will. To be “upright in heart” is to have one’s moral compass aligned, even if one is politically powerless.

Psalm 64 offers an almost eerie parallel to our verse:

> “They sharpen their tongue like a sword,  
> they aim their arrow, a bitter word,  
> to shoot from ambush at the blameless;  
> suddenly they shoot at him, and do not fear”  
> (לִירֹת בַּמִּסְתָּרִים תָּם, Ps 64:4–5).

In both psalms, the wicked’s weapons are readied in secret; in both, the targets are “blameless” or “upright.” Psalm 11, however, answers this scene not by portraying counter‑violence from the righteous, but by introducing a higher Archer: in Psalm 64:8, “God shoots them with an arrow; suddenly they are wounded.” Psalm 11 anticipates that answer not by naming God’s arrow but by insisting that His eyes are already on the scene.

**Verse 3**

כִּי הַשָּׁתוֹת יֵהָרֵסוּן; צַדִּיק מַה־פָּעָל׃  

“For when the foundations are destroyed, what has the righteous done / what can the righteous do?”

This verse crystallizes the advisers’ despair. The key noun, הַשָּׁתוֹת, comes from the root שׁית, “to set, place.” It occurs only here in this plural form, making context and cognates our only guides. Isaiah 19:10 speaks of Egypt’s collapse: “Her foundations (שָׁתֹתֶיהָ) shall be crushed,” where the word seems to denote social or economic pillars. Brown–Driver–Briggs suggests “foundations; stays (of society),” and the Septuagint’s rendering θεσμοί (“laws, ordinances”) points in the same direction: the stable structures that make ordered life possible.

Radak reads it metaphorically: “השתות הם היסודות—the foundations are the foundations,” that is, the pillars of communal righteousness. In his homiletic gloss he even likens them to “the foundation‑stone” (אֶבֶן שְׁתִיָּה) of temple lore, from which the world was established. Meiri, tethered more closely to David’s story, identifies these “foundations” with priests and loyal townspeople whose betrayal (and Saul’s massacre at Nob, 1 Sam 22) shattered the moral underpinnings of the realm.

The question in the second colon is terse but multivalent: צַדִּיק מַה־פָּעָל. Grammatically, פָּעַל is a perfect – “has done.” Many modern readers take a modal sense: “what can the righteous do?” under conditions of systemic breakdown. Traditional commentators often hear a protest of innocence: “the righteous one”—David—“what has he done?” Rashi: “David, who did not sin, what did he do in all this? You will bear the iniquity, not I.” Metzudat David similarly insists that David’s being hunted “is not on account of sin.”

A third possibility, hinted by Malbim, is to hear צַדִּיק as a divine epithet: “What has the Righteous [One] done?”—a veiled complaint that God has failed to intervene when “the foundations” were attached and priests slaughtered. In that reading, verse 3 is not only about human helplessness but about the apparent silence of heaven. The psalm’s next words, “YHWH is in His holy palace; YHWH—His throne is in heaven,” are then not idle theology but a direct reply: God has not abdicated. His non‑intervention is not non‑existence.

What remains clear, beneath these nuances, is that v. 3 marks a hinge. Up to this point we have heard the speech of those who advise flight, culminating in the bleak maxim that personal righteousness is irrelevant when systems collapse. From v. 4 onward, we hear the psalmist’s answer—not by disputing the description of decay, but by shifting the frame of reference from human “foundations” to divine enthronement and scrutiny.

**Verse 4**

יְהוָה בְּהֵיכַל קׇדְשׁוֹ; יְהוָה בַּשָּׁמַיִם כִּסְאוֹ; עֵינָיו יֶחֱזוּ; עַפְעַפָּיו יִבְחֲנוּ בְּנֵי אָדָם׃  

“YHWH is in His holy palace; YHWH—His throne is in heaven. His eyes behold; His eyelids test the children of man.”

Verse 4 is the psalm’s great “turn.” Where v. 1 set “In YHWH I have taken refuge” against “Flee to your mountain,” v. 4 expands the grounds for that refuge.

“YHWH is in His holy palace” (בְּהֵיכַל קׇדְשׁוֹ) invokes the temple as God’s dwelling. The parallel line, “YHWH—His throne is in heaven” (בַּשָּׁמַיִם כִּסְאוֹ), may either identify the temple with the heavenly palace (Ibn Ezra: “His holy palace—this is the heavens”) or hold together transcendence and immanence: even though His throne is above, His presence fills the sanctuary. Ancient Near Eastern temple theology often imagined the earthly temple as a microcosm of the cosmic palace; the ark is God’s footstool, the temple His house, the heavens His full throne.

The second half of the verse descends from throne room to eye. God’s “eyes” (עֵינָיו) “behold” (יֶחֱזוּ) – the same verb that will be used in v. 7 when “the upright shall behold His face.” It is a seeing that recognizes and registers. The parallel clause intensifies the image: “His eyelids test (יִבְחֲנוּ) the children of man.” Eyelids (עַפְעַפַּיִם) are a poetic rarity; the term appears only a handful of times. In Proverbs 4:25 they are directed: “Let your eyes look straight forward, and your eyelids gaze straight before you” (וְעַפְעַפֶּיךָ יַיְשִׁרוּ נֶגְדֶּךָ). In Proverbs 30:13 they are marks of arrogance: “a generation … whose eyelids are lifted high” (וְעַפְעַפָּיו יִנָּשֵׂאוּ). Here they belong to God and “test.”

The verb בָּחַן, as noted, is the language of assay, used for refining metal: “I have tested you in the furnace of affliction” (צָרַפְתִּיךָ בְּכוּר עֹנִי, Isa 48:10, with בָּחַן in related contexts). Psalm 7, another “archer psalm,” links the same vocabulary: “Bring to an end the evil of the wicked, and establish the righteous; for You test hearts and kidneys, O righteous God” (בֹּחֵן לִבּוֹת וּכְלָיוֹת, Ps 7:10). In Psalm 11 the target of this testing is broad—“the children of man” (בְּנֵי אָדָם)—but the next verses will specify how it plays out differently for righteous and wicked.

One small but revealing textual note: the Septuagint, perhaps reading a slightly different Hebrew, has “His eyes look upon the poor” instead of “the children of man.” That Greek choice foregrounds God’s care for the oppressed. The Masoretic text, with its more general “children of man,” keeps the focus on comprehensive scrutiny: no one, powerful or powerless, is outside the divine field of vision.

**Verse 5**

יְהוָה צַדִּיק יִבְחָן; וְרָשָׁע וְאֹהֵב חָמָס שָׂנְאָה נַפְשׁוֹ׃  

“YHWH is righteous; He tests [the righteous]. But the wicked and the lover of violence His very soul hates.”

This line braids together three elements: God’s character (“YHWH is righteous”), His action (“He tests”), and His aversion (“His soul hates”).

The phrase יְהוָה צַדִּיק can be read as a nominal sentence: “YHWH is righteous,” a core biblical claim repeated in many places (“Righteous and upright is He,” צַדִּיק וְיָשָׁר הוּא, Deut 32:4). In that reading, יִבְחָן introduces a new clause: “He tests [the righteous].” Some hear an apposition: “YHWH, [who is] righteous, tests [both].” Either way, the verb picks up the “eyelids testing” of v. 4 and specifies their object.

Traditional commentators are at pains to show that this “testing” is not hostile. Radak cites Proverbs 3:12—“for whom YHWH loves, He reproves”—to argue that the afflictions of the righteous are a sign of divine favor and a means of public vindication. Rashi offers a memorable parable:

> “The flax worker—as long as he knows his flax is of high quality, he beats it and beats it; but when it is poor, he diminishes the beating.”

The righteous, like good flax, can withstand and even be improved by blows; the wicked, like shoddy flax, disintegrate.

The second colon shifts tone: “וְרָשָׁע וְאֹהֵב חָמָס שָׂנְאָה נַפְשׁוֹ.” The compound “the wicked and the lover of violence” uses the participle אֹהֵב (“one who loves”) to emphasize disposition rather than an isolated act: this is someone whose heart inclines toward חָמָס, a word that denotes destructive wrongdoing. In Genesis, חָמָס is what fills the earth before the Flood (Gen 6:11); in the prophets, it often names social and judicial brutality.

“שָׂנְאָה נַפְשׁוֹ” literally, “His soul hates.” Referring to God’s *nephesh* is bold anthropomorphism, much like Leviticus 26:30’s “My soul shall abhor you” (וְגָעֲלָה נַפְשִׁי אֶתְכֶם) in the context of covenant curses. It is not that God is capriciously angry; rather, His very being is incompatible with a person devoted to violence. If in v. 3 the counselors wondered what the righteous can do when the “foundations” are smashed, vv. 4–5 reply: the true foundation is that YHWH is righteous, tests character, and cannot be neutral toward cruelty.

**Verse 6**

יַמְטֵר עַל־רְשָׁעִים פַּחִים; אֵשׁ וְגָפְרִית; וְרוּחַ זִלְעָפוֹת מְנָת כּוֹסָם׃  

“He will rain upon the wicked snares, fire and sulfur; and a scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.”

The imagery of v. 6 draws together several strands of biblical judgment language. The verb יַמְטֵר (“He will rain”) recalls the Sodom story: “YHWH rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah sulfur and fire from YHWH out of heaven” (וַיהוָה הִמְטִיר עַל־סְדֹם וְעַל־עֲמֹרָה גָּפְרִית וָאֵשׁ, Gen 19:24). Rain, ordinarily a blessing that makes crops grow, becomes the vehicle of destruction—a kind of anti‑creation in which the heavens send down not water but burning stone.

“פַּחִים” are, in most occurrences, “snares” or “traps,” especially for birds. Hosea says, “You have been a snare at Mizpah” (פַּח, Hos 5:1); the psalmist rejoices, “We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowlers; the snare is broken, and we have escaped” (פַּח יוֹקֶשׁ, Ps 124:7). Some medieval commentators, Rashi among them, take our word as פֶּחָמִים, “coals,” and Ibn Ezra links it to the “plates” (פַחִים) made from Korah’s censers (Num 17:3), suggesting glowing stones that fall with the sulfur. The ambiguity allows us to hear both: what rains on the wicked entangles and burns.

“Fire and sulfur” (אֵשׁ וְגָפְרִית) clearly echo Sodom and appear elsewhere as emblems of total devastation: Isaiah foresees Edom’s streams turned into “pitch, and her soil into sulfur” (גָּפְרִית, Isa 34:9). The phrase “רוּחַ זִלְעָפוֹת”—“a scorching (or raging) wind”—occurs only here, in Lamentations (“because of the scorching heat of famine,” מִפְּנֵי זַלְעֲפוֹת רָעָב, Lam 5:10), and in Psalm 119:53: “Hot indignation (זַלְעָפָה) seizes me because of the wicked.” It suggests both physical furnace‑heat and the burning of wrath.

Finally, “מְנָת כּוֹסָם”—“the portion of their cup”—places this storm in the framework of allotted destiny. “Cup” (כּוֹס) in Hebrew poetry is a stock metaphor for what God assigns a person or nation to experience. Psalm 16:5 uses it positively: “YHWH is my allotted portion and my cup” (יְהוָה מְנָת־חֶלְקִי וְכוֹסִי). Psalm 75:9 uses it for wrath: “For in the hand of YHWH there is a cup … He pours from it, and all the wicked of the earth shall drain it down to the dregs” (כּוֹס בְּיַד־יְהוָה … אַךְ־שְׁמָרֶיהָ יִמְצֻוּ, Ps 75:9). Psalm 11 belongs to this latter tradition: the storm of snares, fire, sulfur, and wind is not random weather but the measured “cup” that fits the lover of violence.

These images have been powerful enough that later liturgy borrows them almost verbatim, as in Sukkot prayers that contrast the protective sukkah with the “rain of snares upon the wicked,” and in *seliḥot* that remember the siege of Jerusalem as a “scorching wind.” The psalm’s meteorology of judgment has become part of Judaism’s vocabulary for thinking about historical catastrophe.

**Verse 7**

כִּי־צַדִּיק יְהוָה; צְדָקוֹת אָהֵב; יָשָׁר יֶחֱזוּ פָנֵימוֹ׃  

“For YHWH is righteous; He loves righteous deeds; the upright shall behold His face.”

The final verse both summarizes and extends the psalm’s theological argument. It begins by returning to character: “כִּי־צַדִּיק יְהוָה”—“for YHWH is righteous.” This restates v. 5’s “YHWH [is] righteous” and echoes wider Torah affirmations: “a God of faithfulness and without iniquity, righteous and upright is He” (צַדִּיק וְיָשָׁר הוּא, Deut 32:4). The “for” (כִּי) grounds the preceding threats and promises in who God is.

“צְדָקוֹת אָהֵב” can mean either “He loves righteousness” in the abstract or, more concretely, “He loves righteous deeds.” The plural צְדָקוֹת often points to specific acts: Judges 5:11 praises “the righteous acts of YHWH” (צִדְקוֹת יְהוָה) in Israel’s deliverance; Micah 6:5 urges Israel to remember “the righteous deeds of YHWH” in the exodus. Radak applies that concrete sense to people: צְדָקוֹת אִישׁ צִדְקוֹת—“a man of righteous deeds.” Psalm 11 thus concludes not with a dualism between God’s righteousness and human helplessness but with an affinity: God’s love is drawn toward people whose actions reflect His own moral bent.

The last colon is the most audacious: “יָשָׁר יֶחֱזוּ פָנֵימוֹ”—“the upright shall behold His face.” “יָשָׁר,” like “upright of heart” earlier, functions here as a collective singular: the upright ones. The verb חזה (“see, behold”) deliberately recalls v. 4 (“His eyes behold”), creating a kind of inclusio of vision: God has been watching; at the end, the upright will see Him. The mutual gaze is the psalm’s deepest answer to v. 3’s question about destroyed foundations. The ultimate foundation is not institutional but relational.

The claim presses against the famous prohibition to Moses, “You cannot see My face, for no human can see Me and live” (Exod 33:20). Jewish exegetes resolve this tension in several ways. Some, including Rashi and Radak in one of his readings, take “face” metaphorically as a cipher for favor or presence: to “see God’s face” is to live under His smiling attention, as in “The face of YHWH is against evildoers” (פְּנֵי יְהוָה בְּעֹשֵׂי רָע, Ps 34:17). On this reading, the promise is that the upright will discern, in this life, the reality of divine approval even when circumstances are harsh.

Others, citing “As for me, I shall behold Your face in righteousness; when I awake, I shall be satisfied with Your likeness” (אֲנִי בְּצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ, Ps 17:15), hear an eschatological note: the beatific vision of the world to come. Malbim, writing in the nineteenth century, gives the line an ethical twist: God loves “righteous deeds” only when they are performed with a straight, undivided intention—“if the righteous acts look straight toward the face of YHWH … if the goal and intent of the righteous acts is for the sake of YHWH alone.” Then, he says, “the upright shall behold His face”—that is, the one whose practice is truly oriented “straight” (יָשָׁר) toward God will experience an intimate awareness of Him.

The psalm, in any case, refuses to answer v. 3’s “what can the righteous do?” with a list of tactics. It answers instead with a description of who God is and what He loves, and with a promise that the line of sight runs both ways. In a world where wickedness works “in darkness” and moral supports crumble, Psalm 11 insists that the decisive reality is not where one can flee but whom one is facing—and Who is watching in return.
