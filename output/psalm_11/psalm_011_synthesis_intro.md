# Introduction Essay

The ancient Israelite sage who composed Psalm 11 faced a dilemma that resonates across millennia: when violence erupts and social order crumbles, where does one find security? The psalm opens with a declaration of refuge—"בַּֽיהֹוָ֨ה ׀ חָסִ֗יתִי" (*baYHWH ḥāsîtî*, "In the LORD I have taken refuge," v. 1a)—but this confident assertion is immediately challenged by urgent counsel to flee. The poem's architecture dramatizes this tension, moving from a quoted voice of despair (vv. 1b-3) to a theological response grounded in divine sovereignty (vv. 4-7). What makes this psalm extraordinary is not that it resolves the crisis through divine intervention, but that it transforms the very terms of the question by shifting from horizontal human action to vertical divine observation.

The dialogical structure creates a vivid drama. Advisors—perhaps fellow refugees or well-meaning friends during David's flight from Saul, according to traditional interpretation—urge the psalmist: "נ֝֗וּדִי הַרְכֶ֥ם צִפּֽוֹר" (*nûdî harkhem tsippôr*, "Flee to your mountain, bird!" v. 1b). The simile is visceral: the righteous person is imagined as a vulnerable bird, hunted and exposed. The imagery intensifies with detailed archery language: "כִּ֤י הִנֵּ֪ה הָרְשָׁעִ֡ים יִדְרְכ֬וּן קֶ֗שֶׁת כּוֹנְנ֣וּ חִצָּ֣ם עַל־יֶ֑תֶר" (*kî hinnēh hārəšāʿîm yidrəḵûn qešet kônənû ḥiṣṣām ʿal-yeter*, "For behold, the wicked bend the bow, they have set their arrow on the string," v. 2). The Hebrew verbs create a sequence of menace—bending (*yidrəḵûn*), setting (*kônənû*), shooting (*lîrôt*)—that conveys the methodical preparation of an ambush. Radak notes the specific danger: "לירות במו אפל...בהסתר" (*lîrôt bəmô-ʾōfel...bəhēstēr*, "to shoot in darkness...in secret")—this is assassination, not open combat.

The counsel of despair reaches its climax in verse 3 with a rhetorical question that has puzzled interpreters for centuries: "כִּ֣י הַ֭שָּׁתוֹת יֵהָרֵס֑וּן צַ֝דִּ֗יק מַה־פָּעָֽל" (*kî haššātôt yēhārēsûn ṣaddîq mah-pāʿal*, "When the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?"). What are these "foundations" (*haššātôt*)? The term appears only here in Psalms, derived from the root שׁית (*šyt*, "to set, place"). BDB suggests it could mean "foundations" or even "nets" or "snares," while Radak offers multiple readings: "השתות הם היסודות" (*haššātôt hēm hayyəsôdôt*, "the foundations are the foundations"), interpreting them as either architectural supports, cosmic foundations, or metaphorically as moral and social order. The Meiri, writing in thirteenth-century Provence, takes a historical approach, connecting this to David's experience at Keilah when the city's leaders planned to betray him to Saul. In this reading, the "foundations" are the very people—priests at Nob, citizens of Keilah—who should have been pillars of support but instead became sources of danger.

The question "צַ֝דִּ֗יק מַה־פָּעָֽל" (*ṣaddîq mah-pāʿal*) is syntactically ambiguous. The verb פָּעָֽל (*pāʿal*) is perfect tense, allowing either a retrospective reading ("what has the righteous done [to deserve this]?") or a modal one ("what can the righteous do?"). The psalm leaves this question hanging, unanswered—or rather, it answers it by changing the frame of reference entirely.

Verse 4 marks the theological pivot with a remarkable double location formula: "יְהֹוָ֤ה ׀ בְּֽהֵ֘יכַ֤ל קׇדְשׁ֗וֹ יְהֹוָה֮ בַּשָּׁמַ֢יִם כִּ֫סְא֥וֹ" (*YHWH bəhêḵal qodšô YHWH baššāmayim kisʾô*, "The LORD is in His holy temple, the LORD—His throne is in heaven"). This bicolon has generated significant interpretive debate. Does it assert simultaneous divine presence in both earthly temple and heavenly throne room, reflecting ancient Near Eastern temple theology where temples functioned as cosmic contact points? Or is "בְּֽהֵ֘יכַ֤ל קׇדְשׁ֗וֹ" (*bəhêḵal qodšô*, "His holy temple") itself a reference to the heavens, with the parallel structure simply intensifying a single claim? Ibn Ezra takes the latter view: "היכל קדשו הם השמים" (*hêḵal qodšô hēm haššāmayim*, "His holy temple is the heavens"). Either way, the effect is clear: divine sovereignty is established as the ground of response to the crisis.

What follows is one of the psalm's most striking features—the detailed anthropomorphism of divine vision. The psalm declares: "עֵינָ֥יו יֶחֱז֑וּ עַפְעַפָּ֥יו יִ֝בְחֲנ֗וּ בְּנֵ֣י אָדָֽם" (*ʿênāyw yeḥĕzû ʿapʿappāyw yivḥănû bənê ʾādām*, "His eyes behold, His eyelids test humanity," v. 4b). The specificity of "עַפְעַפָּ֥יו" (*ʿapʿappāyw*, "His eyelids") is unusual—why not simply "eyes"? The term suggests careful, deliberate scrutiny, the narrowed gaze of one examining something closely. The verb בחן (*bḥn*, "to test, examine") appears twice (vv. 4, 5), carrying metallurgical overtones of refining and testing precious metals. This creates a profound contrast with the wicked who "shoot from darkness" (v. 2). The psalm constructs an epistemological binary: the wicked operate in concealment (*bəmô-ʾōfel*, "in darkness"), assuming they are unseen, while God's comprehensive vision penetrates all pretense.

The psalm's treatment of divine testing in verse 5 has troubled interpreters. "יְהֹוָה֮ צַדִּ֢יק יִ֫בְחָ֥ן וְ֭רָשָׁע וְאֹהֵ֣ב חָמָ֑ס שָֽׂנְאָ֥ה נַפְשֽׁוֹ" (*YHWH ṣaddîq yivḥān wərāšāʿ wəʾōhēv ḥāmās śānəʾāh napšô*, "The LORD tests the righteous, but the wicked and lover of violence His soul hates"). Does God test both righteous and wicked equally, or—as the syntax might suggest—does He test the righteous while hating the wicked? Rashi famously resolves this with a parable: the flax worker beats good flax vigorously because it can withstand the treatment, but handles poor flax gently because it would disintegrate. God's testing of the righteous is thus a mark of confidence, not hostility. Metzudat David concurs: "מה שאני נרדף משאול לא הוא בעבור העון" (*mah še-ʾănî nirdāp miššāʾûl lōʾ hûʾ baʿăvôr hē-ʿāwōn*, "That I am pursued by Saul is not on account of sin")—persecution does not imply guilt.

Verse 6 unleashes a torrent of judgment imagery: "יַמְטֵ֥ר עַל־רְשָׁעִ֗ים פַּ֫חִ֥ים אֵ֣שׁ וְ֭גׇפְרִית וְר֥וּחַ זִלְעָפ֗וֹת מְנָ֣ת כּוֹסָֽם" (*yamṭēr ʿal-rəšāʿîm paḥîm ʾēš wəgop̄rît wərûaḥ zilʿāp̄ôt mənāt kôsām*, "He will rain upon the wicked snares, fire and sulfur and scorching wind—the portion of their cup"). The verb "rain" (*yamṭēr*) creates a devastating inversion: rain, normally the source of blessing in an agrarian society, becomes the vehicle of destruction. The catalog of judgment—"פַּ֫חִ֥ים" (*paḥîm*, "snares" or possibly "coals"), "אֵ֣שׁ וְ֭גׇפְרִית" (*ʾēš wəgop̄rît*, "fire and sulfur")—unmistakably evokes the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis 19:24: "וַיהֹוָ֗ה הִמְטִ֧יר עַל־סְדֹ֛ם וְעַל־עֲמֹרָ֖ה גָּפְרִ֣ית וָאֵ֑שׁ" (*waYHWH himṭîr ʿal-Səḏōm wəʿal-ʿĂmōrāh gop̄rît wāʾēš*, "And the LORD rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire"). The allusion positions divine judgment as anti-creation, a reversal of the generative order. The phrase "מְנָ֣ת כּוֹסָֽם" (*mənāt kôsām*, "the portion of their cup") employs the metaphor of destiny as an allotted inheritance—what one receives is what one has earned.

The psalm concludes with a tripartite affirmation in verse 7: "כִּֽי־צַדִּ֣יק יְ֭הֹוָה צְדָק֣וֹת אָהֵ֑ב יָ֝שָׁ֗ר יֶחֱז֥וּ פָנֵֽימוֹ" (*kî-ṣaddîq YHWH ṣədāqôt ʾāhēv yāšār yeḥĕzû p̄ānêmô*, "For the LORD is righteous; righteousness He loves; the upright shall behold His face"). The first two cola establish divine character and divine preference—God is righteous and loves righteous deeds. But the third colon makes a startling promise: "יָ֝שָׁ֗ר יֶחֱז֥וּ פָנֵֽימוֹ" (*yāšār yeḥĕzû p̄ānêmô*, "the upright shall behold His face"). This creates a deliberate echo with verse 4's assertion that God's eyes "behold" (*yeḥĕzû*) humanity—now the direction of seeing is reversed. The upright will see God. This raises an interpretive challenge given Exodus 33:20's prohibition: "לֹ֥א תוּכַ֖ל לִרְאֹ֣ת אֶת־פָּנָ֑י כִּ֛י לֹֽא־יִרְאַ֥נִי הָאָדָ֖ם וָחָֽי" (*lōʾ ṯûḵal lirəʾōṯ ʾeṯ-pānāy kî lōʾ-yirəʾănî hāʾādām wāḥāy*, "You cannot see My face, for no human can see Me and live"). Is this cultic language, referring to encountering God in temple worship? Is it eschatological, pointing to a future beatific vision? Or is it metaphorical, describing the experience of divine favor? Radak offers multiple readings: "ופניתי אליכם" (*ûp̄ānîṯî ʾălêḵem*, "and I will turn My face toward you," Lev 26:9), suggesting divine attention and blessing. The ambiguity may be deliberate—the psalm promises not simply rescue but ultimate intimacy with the divine, however that may be conceived.

What makes Psalm 11 enduringly powerful is its refusal to answer the pragmatic question on its own terms. The advisors ask, "What can the righteous do?" The psalm does not provide a tactical manual for resistance or survival. Instead, it reframes the crisis by asserting that the ultimate reality is not the wicked's archery or the destroyed foundations, but God's comprehensive vision and discriminating justice. The psalm's movement from the horizontal plane (flee to the mountain) to the vertical axis (the LORD in heaven) represents not escapism but a reorientation of perception. The righteous do not need to *do* anything because God *sees* everything. In a world where violence operates in darkness and moral foundations seem to crumble, the psalm stakes everything on the claim that divine observation is itself a form of protection, and divine justice, however delayed, is certain. The final promise—that the upright will behold God's face—transforms refuge from a place of hiding into a position of privilege, from defensive retreat into assured encounter. This is not theodicy as explanation but theodicy as reframing, offering not answers but a different vantage point from which to view the crisis.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

Psalm 11 does not appear as a complete recitation in the standard liturgical cycle, but specific phrases have found liturgical life in highly focused contexts. The phrase "עַל־רְשָׁעִ֗ים פַּ֫חִ֥ים" (*ʿal-rəšāʿîm paḥîm*, "upon the wicked snares") from verse 6 appears in a personal prayer recited in the sukkah during Sukkot, found in both Ashkenazic and Sephardic rites. This meditation, often associated with the *Ushpizin* ceremony of welcoming mystical guests, incorporates the verse into a petition that reads: "וְלַחֲסוֹת מִזֶּרֶם וּמִמָּטָר, כִּי תַמְטִיר עַל רְשָׁעִים פַּחִים" (*wəlaḥăsôṯ mizzerem ûmmimāṭār, kî ṯamṭîr ʿal rəšāʿî
