# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 4

The current draft has notable strengths. It hears the psalm’s evening timbre, tracks the addressee shifts with care, and frames the poem as a wisdom-inflected prayer rather than a simple lament. The treatment of “rigzu” (v. 5) and the multiple possibilities for me’et (v. 8) is judicious; the contrast between “their grain and wine” and a gift of inner joy is well observed; and the inclusio (call/answer in vv. 2 and 4; bed/sleep in vv. 5 and 9) is rightly emphasized. Traditional voices (Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Radak, Malbim) are present, and the draft acknowledges the priestly blessing’s echo in v. 7.

Where it falls short: the introduction occasionally leans on abstract nouns rather than letting the Hebrew do its crisp work. Several answerable questions remain only posed: the semantics of הִפְלָה (hiflah) in v. 4; the status of “sons of man” (בְּנֵי אִישׁ) as elites; the function of יַחְדָּו (yachdav) in v. 9; and the concrete sense of זִבְחֵי־צֶדֶק (zivchei-tzedek). The liturgical section is underdeveloped: it should quote prayers in Hebrew and show how use in Kriat Shema al ha-Mitah and Selichot reframes the psalm. The figurative language database is underused; the spatial metaphor “from narrowness to broad place” has rich biblical parallels (Ps 18:20; 118:5; 25:17) that could illuminate v. 2. Likewise, the “light of Your face” is a well-attested idiom (Num 6:25; Ps 44:4; 89:16) that deserves fuller patterning.

Stylistically, the prose sometimes names devices (“inclusio,” “didactic”) without defining them for lay readers. Terms like LXX (Septuagint), colon (a poetic line in a parallel pair), and inclusio (a framing repetition at beginning and end) should be glossed briefly. Finally, the verse commentary could integrate reception: the Talmudic “let the good impulse provoke the evil impulse” (Berakhot 5a) on v. 5 is central, as is the bedtime Shema.

The revision below addresses these gaps: clarifies terms, tightens the thesis, answers the open questions using supplied sources, incorporates liturgical quotations, and adds comparative biblical evidence for the psalm’s figurative language and diction.
