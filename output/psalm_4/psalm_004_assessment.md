# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 4

What works: The draft sees Psalm 4 whole. It traces the movement from plea to instruction to repose; it spots the moral center in the contrast between trust and the chase for “grain and wine”; it handles difficult cruxes—רִגְזוּ, הִפְלָה, זִבְחֵי־צֶדֶק—competently and brings the medievals (Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Radak, Malbim, Meiri) into real conversation. It also makes productive use of intertexts (Numbers 6:25; Deuteronomy 33:28) and reception (Bedtime Shema; High Holiday piyyut).

What needs revision: A few overstatements creep in. The superscription does not “declare explicitly” an evening prayer; it specifies musical performance. The tone sometimes leans breathless (“audacious epistemological claim”). Several concepts—“inclusio,” “Hiphil,” “merism,” “LXX”—are used without definition for lay readers. The figurative-language analysis is solid but can be sharpened by citing precise biblical parallels with brief patterns (e.g., “light of face,” Psalm 44:4; Proverbs 16:15; “narrow→wide,” Job 36:16; Psalm 25:17). The liturgical section is strong but needs clearer structure with subheadings and Hebrew quotations from the prayers themselves.

Missed opportunities: 
- Rigzu and the rabbinic program (Berakhot 4b–5a) deserve a crisp synthesis that shows how the verse underwrites an evening discipline. 
- “נְסָה” in v.7 should be identified as a defective Hiphil of נָשָׂא (“lift”), not “test,” and linked more tightly to the Aaronic blessing.
- The inclusio formed by צֶדֶק (vv. 2, 6) and the structural role of Selah as hinge-markers (vv. 3, 5) merit brief explanation.
- The LXX’s addition of “oil” at v.8 should be noted as expanding the Deuteronomic triad.

Figurative-language assessment: The draft cites good parallels but could more often state frequency and typical contexts—e.g., “light of your face” (rare, concentrated in blessing contexts: Psalm 4:7; 44:4; 89:16; Proverbs 16:15); “narrowness/breadth” (distress→spaciousness in Psalm 4:2; Job 36:16; Psalm 25:17). These comparisons should be used to illuminate why those same images are rhetorically effective here.

In short, the revision should moderate the tone, define terms, tighten a few claims, strengthen the figurative comparisons with specific citations, and restructure the liturgical section with precise subheadings and Hebrew quotations.
