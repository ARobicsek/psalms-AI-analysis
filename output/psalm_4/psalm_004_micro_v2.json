      "commentary": "Dramatic vocative shift: psalmist turns from God to address 'בְּנֵי אִישׁ' (sons of men/mortals). This is unusual in lament genre - prayers typically address God throughout. Rhetorical question 'עַד־מֶה' (how long) is lament formula, but directed at humans, not deity. Triple accusation: they turn כְבוֹדִי (my glory/honor) into כְלִמָּה (shame), love רִיק (emptiness/illusion), seek כָזָב (fraud/lie). The word כָבוֹד is multivalent - personal honor, divine glory, or both? Sound pattern: /k/ alliteration in 'כְבוֹדִי לִכְלִמָּה' emphasizes transformation.",

Key theological claim: 'הִפְלָה יְהוָה חָסִיד לוֹ' - YHWH 'singles out/makes wonderful/distinguishes' the חָסִיד (faithful/pious one) for Himself. The verb הִפְלָה (hiphil of פָּלָא) suggests divine action that creates distinction or performs wonders. Election theology: God's selective setting apart of the faithful. Second half creates inclusio with v.2: 'יְהוָה יִשְׁמַע בְּקׇרְאִי אֵלָיו' echoes the opening petition, demonstrating answered prayer within the psalm itself.

LXX reads 'be angry' (cited by Paul in Eph 4:26!). Followed by prohibition 'וְאַל־תֶּחֱטָאוּ' (and do not sin). Second imperative sequence: 'אִמְרוּ בִלְבַבְכֶם' (speak in your hearts) + 'עַל־מִשְׁכַּבְכֶם' (on your beds) + 'וְדֹמּוּ' (and be silent). Evening imagery emerges: bed as place of reflection.

      "commentary": "The psalm's rhetorical climax and interpretive crux. 'נָתַתָּה שִׂמְחָה בְלִבִּי' (you have put joy in my heart) - perfect verb suggests completed action, God as subject, joy as direct gift to the heart (not circumstance-dependent). Critical temporal clause: 'מֵעֵת דְּגָנָם וְתִירוֹשָׁם רָבּוּ' (from the time [when] their grain and wine increased/multiplied). The possessive suffix on 'דְּגָנָם וְתִירוֹשָׁם' (their grain and wine) distinguishes 'them' from 'me' - others have material abundance. Grain and wine are covenant blessing vocabulary (Deut 7:13, 11:14). The מֵעֵת construction is ambiguous: 'more than when,' 'at the time when,' or 'because'?

'בְּשָׁלוֹם יַחְדָּו' (in peace together) - the adverb יַחְדָּו is ambiguous: 'together' (with whom?), 'at once,' or 'altogether/safely.'

    "Why does the psalmist use the unique epithet 'God of my righteousness/vindication' (אֱלֹהֵי צִדְקִי) in v.2 - is this forensic/legal language suggesting a lawsuit context where God vindicates the psalmist's claim?",
    "What is the semantic range and function of כָבוֹד (glory/honor) in v.3 - personal reputation in honor-shame culture, divine glory reflected in the psalmist, or material wealth? How does its transformation to כְלִמָּה (shame) work?",
    "What does רִגְזוּ mean in v.5 - 'tremble' (in fear of God), 'be angry' (LXX and Paul's reading), or 'be agitated'? How does this choice affect the instruction's meaning - is anger legitimate if it doesn't lead to sin?",
    "What are 'sacrifices of righteousness' (זִבְחֵי־צֶדֶק) in v.6 - morally upright sacrifices, properly performed rituals according to Torah, or metaphorical worship? How does this relate to prophetic critique of empty ritual?",
    "How should מֵעֵת in v.8 be interpreted - comparative ('more than when their grain...'), temporal ('at the time when their grain...'), or causal ('because their grain...')? This determines whether the psalmist lacks prosperity or transcends it",
    "Who are 'the many' (רַבִּים) in v.7 - are they the same as the 'sons of men' adversaries from v.3, or the broader community including sympathetic voices? Is their prayer for divine blessing legitimate or misguided?",
    "What does the verb הִפְלָה mean in v.4 - 'set apart,' 'make wonderful/marvelous,' 'distinguish,' or 'show favor'? Is this about individual election or corporate identity of the חָסִיד (faithful/pious)?",
    "How does יַחְדָּו function in v.9 - 'together' (with God, implying intimate communion), 'together' (with community), 'at once' (both lie down and sleep simultaneously), or 'safely/altogether'?",
    "What is the theological force of לְבָדָד ('alone') in v.9 - monotheistic confession (YHWH alone not other gods), sufficiency claim (YHWH alone not YHWH plus prosperity), or isolation (psalmist alone with God in solitude)?",
    "Why does the psalm address adversaries directly (vv.3-6) rather than complaining about them to God - what rhetorical or liturgical function does this confrontational instruction serve?",
    "How does the priestly blessing allusion in v.7 ('lift up the light of your face') function - is the psalmist affirming this request but redefining fulfillment, or critiquing conventional piety that seeks visible signs?",
    "What is the relationship between the evening setting (bed, sleep, lie down) and the psalm's theological argument about competing securities - why is nighttime the appropriate frame for this teaching?"
