**Verse 1**

The superscription, לַמְנַצֵּחַ בִּנְגִינוֹת מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד, gives us three coordinates: who directs (the “leader,” i.e., chief musician), how it is performed (בִּנְגִינוֹת, with stringed instruments), and whose voice it channels (David). נְגִינָה denotes string-music (BDB), and this heading recurs in several psalms (4, 6, 54, 55, 67, 76), marking pieces likely accompanied by lyre or harp. The Septuagint flattens the musical specificity into a more generic “for the end, in psalm, a song of David,” which tells us more about the translator’s priorities than the Hebrew’s intent. Medieval Jewish commentators tie the heading to temple praxis: “the one who was over the singers” (Radak); a psalm “to be recited by the Levites who conduct the melodies” (Rashi). The heading itself does not fix a time of day; the evening ambience emerges from the poem’s close (v. 9).

Two literary observations belong here. First, headings in Psalms are part of reception history: they encode how the poem was used, not necessarily how it was first written. Second, the presence of a performance rubric alongside David’s name invites a dual hearing. In one register the speaker is the royal voice—useful if one reads the psalm against Absalom’s revolt (many do). In another, the voice is that of any faithful one set apart by God (v. 4). This doubleness lets the psalm pass from court to congregation to bedside.

Finally, the heading’s juxtaposition of “strings” and “psalm” opens a small door into the poetics. Much of Hebrew verse is crafted for the ear—the terse lines balance stresses rather than syllables—and string accompaniment likely aided both memory and mood. The poem we are about to hear will move between address to God (vv. 2, 4, 7, 9), address to opponents (v. 3), and direct instruction (vv. 5–6). A leader coordinating voices and strings is not incidental; the psalm is meant to be performed as well as pondered.

**Verse 2**

“בְּקׇרְאִי עֲנֵנִי אֱלֹהֵי צִדְקִי; בַּצָּר הִרְחַבְתָּ לִּי; חׇנֵּנִי וּשְׁמַע תְּפִלָּתִי.” The line runs on the rails of memory and plea. The title “אֱלֹהֵי צִדְקִי” (“God of my righteousness/vindication”) is richly ambiguous. As Radak puts it, the poet appeals to the Judge who knows where the right lies; Ibn Ezra emphasizes causation: God is “the primary cause for revealing my righteousness.” This is not abstract attribute; it is courtroom language. And it frames the rest of the psalm, which will call for “sacrifices of righteousness” (v. 6), an inclusio that binds prayer to practice.

The second colon turns bodily: “בַּצָּר הִרְחַבְתָּ לִּי”—literally, “In narrowness you made wide for me.” The root צר (“narrow, constrict”) is the stock word for distress. The figurative move from tight quarters to open space—“a broad place where there is no constraint” (Job 36:16); “deliver me from my straits” (Psalm 25:17)—is a biblical way to name the feeling of relief when the pressure eases. It is also theology: YHWH is the one who gives room to breathe. The perfect tense (“You have widened”) anchors the plea: because You have done this, do it again.

The piling of imperatives—“Answer… be gracious… hear”—does not so much beseech as assume covenantal responsiveness. Liturgically, this opening is beloved in penitential contexts (Yom Kippur Katan; fast days), where communities splice it into strings of verses that couple “distress” with enlargement: “בַּצָּר הִרְחַבְתָּ לָנוּ… שְׁמַע תְּפִלָּתֵנוּ” (“In distress You have made room for us… hear our prayer”). The psalm’s grammar—past action yielding present confidence—has become a grammar of fast-day hope.

**Verse 3**

“בְּנֵי אִישׁ, עַד־מֶה כְבוֹדִי לִכְלִמָּה; תֶּאֱהָבוּן רִיק; תְּבַקְשׁוּ כָזָב. סֶלָה.” The address is confrontational and social. בְּנֵי אִישׁ often distinguishes “men of rank” from “sons of Adam,” the masses (Psalm 49:3; 62:10). If the historical backdrop is Absalom’s uprising, the elites’ defection explains the sting: “my glory” (כְבוֹדִי)—kingship, or at least honor—has been turned to shame (לִכְלִמָּה). Rashi quotes the taunts, “Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse?” (1 Samuel 25:10), to put content to the disgrace.

The twin pursuits, “love emptiness” (רִיק) and “seek falsehood” (כָזָב), name not just lies but insubstantial goods: a kingdom that cannot stand (Radak), strategies that have no weight. This pairing of abstractions with desire verbs (“love,” “seek”) is pointed. It is not that the elites failed to know a fact; they attached their loves to things that don’t last. The line ends with “סֶלָה”—a liturgical pause that in this psalm marks transitions. Here it invites the listener to sit with the indictment before the psalm turns to what the opponents must “know.”

The rhetoric is compact and characteristic. An interrogative (“how long?”) prods conscience; a stark binary (“honor”/“shame”) outlines the stakes; biting parallelism (“love emptiness,” “seek falsehood”) sketches the pathology. The poet will not stay in accusation. He will teach—first doctrine (v. 4), then discipline (vv. 5–6).

**Verse 4**

“וּדְעוּ כִּי־הִפְלָה יְהוָה חָסִיד לוֹ; יְהוָה יִשְׁמַע בְּקָרְאִי אֵלָיו.” The imperative “וּדְעוּ” (“know!”) answers the previous “how long?” The knowledge is not abstract; it is recognition of God’s action. הִפְלָה (Hiphil of פלא) can mean “distinguish/separate” (Exodus 9:4; 11:7) and, by connection to פלא (“wonder”), “make wonderful.” Rashi glosses “separated”; Ibn Ezra couples both senses: God both distinguished and “made known” who His חסיד is. Radak applies it to royal election: God “has separated me from all Israel to be king.”

But “חָסִיד” reaches beyond monarchy. The word, often translated “faithful” or “pious,” denotes one who embodies covenantal kindness—who does good “beyond the strict requirement of the law” (Radak, citing David’s mercy to Saul). The Septuagint renders it “His holy one,” shifting emphasis to status; the Hebrew keeps ethics in play. The prepositional phrase “לוֹ” (“for Himself”) matters: this is not generic virtue but belonging. The verse’s second half marries doctrine and experience: “YHWH hears when I call to Him.” The verb can be read as habitual present; the declaration has the tone of confidence born from previous rescues (v. 2).

A subtle literary pattern also appears. The divine name יְהוָה brackets the verse, an anaphoric emphasis that frames knowing and hearing within YHWH’s presence. The line also tightens the poem’s structure: “set apart” (v. 4) answers “love emptiness” (v. 3); “hears when I call” answers the imperative “answer me” (v. 2). The result is a compact creed: God distinguishes His faithful; therefore prayer is not shouted into a void.

**Verse 5**

“רִגְזוּ וְאַל־תֶּחֱטָאוּ; אִמְרוּ בִלְבַבְכֶם עַל־מִשְׁכַּבְכֶם; וְדֹמּוּ. סֶלָה.” Five short imperatives sketch an evening discipline. רִגְזוּ can mean “tremble” (Deuteronomy 2:25), “be agitated,” or “be angry” (Septuagint; Ephesians 4:26). In this context the flow favors awe: tremble before God, and that trembling will check the hand from sin. Then, “speak in your hearts upon your beds.” The idiom “speaking in the heart” means to think (Genesis 17:17). The bed is both literal (it is evening) and moral: at day’s end, the heart is free of the day’s noise, as Radak notes, and the conscience can hold court. “וְדֹמּוּ”—“be silent”—seals the sequence. The root דמם includes stillness of speech and body (Amos 5:13; Job 31:34). Having trembled and examined, one can stop talking.

Rabbinic tradition built a program out of this verse. “Always incite the good inclination against the evil inclination,” say the sages; if that does not prevail, study Torah; if not, recite the Shema; if not, remind oneself of the day of death (Berakhot 5a). Each step aligns with a clause—trembling, inner speech, bed, silence—and the whole becomes the nightly K’riat Shema al HaMitah. It is a striking example of how Scripture’s verbs become ritual.

Selah, again, marks a hinge. After this, the imperatives will turn outward to the cult (“offer sacrifices,” v. 6) and upward to God’s face (v. 7). But here, in the quiet, the psalmist teaches a pedagogy of the heart: reverence checks sin; the heart speaks; silence heals.

**Verse 6**

“זִבְחוּ זִבְחֵי־צֶדֶק; וּבִטְחוּ אֶל־יְהוָה.” The call to sacrifice comes with a qualifier: “of righteousness.” The phrase appears only here, Deuteronomy 33:19, and Psalm 51:21. In Psalm 51, it follows the broken heart; only then does God “desire sacrifices of righteousness.” This rarity has nourished interpretations. Rashi, reading ethically, glosses: “Make your deeds righteous, and it will be as if you offer sacrifices.” Radak insists on actual offering, but of a kind that expresses real turning: not “the sacrifice of the wicked” (Proverbs 21:27). Ibn Ezra identifies שְׁלָמִים (“peace offerings”), as distinct from sin offerings—a thanksgiving cult. Malbim, reading historically, ties it to David’s vindication after famine (2 Samuel 21): “thanksgiving offerings because his righteousness was clarified.”

The second imperative, “וּבִטְחוּ אֶל־יְהוָה” (“and trust in YHWH”), anchors ritual in disposition. The preposition “אֶל” (“toward”) is notable; it pictures trust as orientation, a turning of face and heart. The line’s pairing teaches a classical biblical lesson: right worship without trust is hollow, and trust without worship is thin. If v. 5 planted an inward practice (self-talk on the bed), v. 6 ties that inward turn to outward worship and Godward confidence.

Liturgically, the phrase has been heard in contexts where “righteous offerings” represent a whole way of life—Shabbat Musaf prayers and readings for the tribal offerings in Nissan—suggesting that the psalm’s brief imperative has long been read as summary: integrity first, then cult; and in both, turn toward God.

**Verse 7**

“רַבִּים אֹמְרִים: מִי יַרְאֵנוּ טוֹב? נְסָה עָלֵינוּ אוֹר פָּנֶיךָ, יְהוָה.” We now hear the murmur of the crowd: “Who will show us good?” The question is not only cynical; it is empirical: which side is winning? In answer, the psalmist does not argue that his side will harvest more. He prays for something else to be seen: “the light of Your face.” The imagery is compact. “Face” (פָּנִים) is presence; “light” is favor. The idiom appears in blessing contexts (Numbers 6:25; Psalm 44:4; 89:16; Proverbs 16:15) and is rare enough to mark the request as priestly in tone. Ibn Ezra’s philological note matters: “נְסָה” is a defective Hiphil spelling of נָשָׂא—“lift,” not “test.” The picture is of a standard (נֵס) raised, a banner-light lifted over a people.

This line has a long liturgical afterlife in the High Holiday Amidah: “נְסָה עָלֵינוּ אוֹר פָּנֶיךָ, יְהוָה.” There the “many” are the worshipers themselves, who know their need. The psalm’s contrast is sharp: the “good” the skeptics demand is material and visible; the “good” the faithful ask for is relational and, paradoxically, more real when other goods are scarce.

**Verse 8**

“נָתַתָּה שִׂמְחָה בְלִבִּי, מֵעֵת דְּגָנָם וְתִירוֹשָׁם רָבוּ.” The line answers the “many” (v. 7) with testimony. The verb is perfect: “You have put joy in my heart.” The preposition מֵעֵת, likely comparative here, makes the claim: this joy exceeds the joy “when their grain and wine multiplied.” “Grain and wine” is a well-worn biblical pair (a merism) that stands for the material abundance of covenant blessing (Deuteronomy 7:13; 11:14). The Septuagint sometimes adds “oil,” completing the Deuteronomic triad, and thereby making explicit what is already implied.

The psalmist is not ascetic. He does not sneer at grain and wine. He simply confesses a different arithmetic: inner joy sourced in God is greater than the joy of harvest—even (and this is key) when the harvest is “theirs.” Some medieval readers hear here the generosity of spirit Radak praises: David rejoices at the prosperity of others, even those who do him ill. Either way, the line prepares the way for sleep: joy is quieter than gloating; it frees the mind to rest.

A brief note on pattern: the root רבב—“be many, increase”—appears in this neighborhood in Psalm 3 (“How many are my foes!” 3:2) and here (“their grain and wine increased”). Enemies multiply; so can harvests. Neither number controls the speaker’s heart. Joy does.

**Verse 9**

“בְּשָׁלוֹם יַחְדָּו אֶשְׁכְּבָה וְאִישָׁן; כִּי־אַתָּה יְהוָה לְבָדָד לָבֶטַח תּוֹשִׁיבֵנִי.” The psalm closes with its most personal line. “In peace, together, I lie down and sleep.” יַחְדָּו can read “together” (with my people, reconciled; Radak takes the wish communally) or “at once” (without anxious delay), both fitting the picture of a conscience settled. “For You, YHWH, alone (לְבָדָד) make me dwell secure.” The adverb “alone” can attach to YHWH (only You do this) or the speaker (You make me secure even when I am alone). The biblical resonance is strong: “Israel dwelt in safety, alone, the fountain of Jacob, in a land of grain and wine” (Deuteronomy 33:28). Psalm 4 subtly relocates the source of that security: not in the land’s output but in God’s agency.

The Hiphil of ישׁב (“cause to dwell”) underscores the causative: the secure dwelling is a gift, not a self-construction. The line’s cadence—“lie down… sleep… dwell secure”—is the grammar of relinquishment. And so the psalm fulfills its own counsel: trembling has led to silence; inner speech has given way to rest. In the Bedtime Shema, this verse arrives as a blessing on the lips of the weary. In life, it is the last word a person needs at night: whatever their neighbor’s tallies, “You, YHWH, alone, make me dwell secure.”

—Definitions (for this verse)—
- Hiphil: a causative verb pattern (“You make me dwell”).
- Merism: “grain and wine” naming a totality of abundance.

This verse also completes the quiet pairing with Psalm 3. There, “I lay down and slept; I awoke, for YHWH sustains me” (3:6). Here, the poet lies down and leaves off before the waking, giving the last word to trust. Between them, the two poems teach a daily rhythm: morning courage; evening repose; a God who widens the narrow place.
