**Verse 1**

The superscription—“לַמְנַצֵּחַ בִּנְגִּינוֹת מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד”—locates the psalm in Israel’s professional liturgy. לַמְנַצֵּחַ (“for the director/leader”) appears across 55 psalm headings; it most naturally denotes the temple official who oversaw musical performance (1 Chr 15:21). בִּנְגִּינוֹת singles out stringed accompaniment (from נְגִינָה), a category the headings deploy sparingly (Ps 4; 6; 54; 55; 67; 76; Hab 3:19). The Davidic tag can function as royal setting (Radak links it to the Absalom episode), but the superscription is primarily liturgical guidance: this prayer was meant to be led, sung, and heard. The notice “with stringed instruments” does more than furnish a soundtrack. Psalm 4 is saturated with evening quiet—“on your beds” (v. 5), “I lie down and sleep” (v. 9). A plucked timbre suits a text that moves from agitation to silence. The form, too, aligns with performance: the pauses marked by סֶלָה (“Selah,” vv. 3, 5) are likely musical interludes—rests in which the congregation listens as the instruments sustain the thought.

It is worth naming how a biblical heading functions. These short docket lines are later editorial markers that bound psalms into collections (e.g., “for the director,” “of David,” “of Asaph”). They indicate manner (“with flutes” in Ps 5) or festival (“for the dedication of the house” in Ps 30). Here, “for the leader… with strings” casts this piece not as a private whisper but as a public instruction. That helps make sense of what follows: a prayer that becomes a rebuke to nobles, then a series of imperatives, then a testimony. This is practical theology for the evening hour, taught with a lyre in hand.

**Verse 2**

“בְּקׇרְאִי עֲנֵנִי אֱלֹהֵי צִדְקִי… בַּצָּר הִרְחַבְתָּ לִּי; חׇנֵּנִי וּשְׁמַע תְּפִלָּתִי.” Three imperatives—“answer… be gracious… hear”—press the plea. The epithet אֱלֹהֵי צִדְקִי (“God of my righteousness/vindication”) is unique in the Psalter and legal in tone: צֶדֶק here points to rightness in dispute (BDB s.v.). The psalm is a lawsuit of sorts, and God is the judge who can publicly restore the speaker’s honor. The perfect verb “הִרְחַבְתָּ לִּי” (“You made wide for me”) inserts a past deliverance into the present request. The spatial idiom is a stock biblical metaphor for rescue: “From the narrow place I called; Yah answered me with freedom” (Ps 118:5), “He brought me out to the broad place” (Ps 18:20). The pair בַּצָּר (“in distress, in straits”) and מֶרְחָב (“broad space”) give us something tactile: distress is constriction; salvation is room to turn around.

The line also sketches the psalm’s logic of confidence. Petition is grounded in memory: “You did this before; do it again.” The sequence “answer… be gracious… hear” progresses from outcome (answer) to attitude (grace) to process (hearing). It rehearses not only what the psalmist wants but who God is. In liturgical use this line often becomes the congregation’s own first cry (see Yom Kippur citations above), which makes sense of the unusual epithet. On a night of judgment, “God of my vindication” is the name faith needs.

**Verse 3**

“בְּנֵי אִישׁ, עַד־מֶה כְבוֹדִי לִכְלִמָּה? תֶּאֱהָבוּן רִיק; תְּבַקְשׁוּ כָזָב.” The addressee shifts from God to “sons of man,” a phrase that, in contrast to בְּנֵי אָדָם (“mortals”), commonly marks people of rank (Ps 49:3; 62:10). The rhetorical “How long?” (עַד־מֶה) normally interrogates God (e.g., Ps 13:2), but here it indicts nobles complicit in honor reversal: the speaker’s כָּבוֹד (“glory,” social weight) is being treated as כְּלִמָּה (“shame, disgrace”). The crimes named—love of רִיק (“emptiness, illusion”) and pursuit of כָזָב (“lie, fraud”)—are not mere insults. In biblical usage these terms often carry idolatrous overtones. Deuteronomy 32:21 castigates Israel for provoking God “with no-gods (בְּלֹא־אֵל),” and the prophets use הֶבֶל/רִיק for “nothings” that cannot save; Ezekiel 13 attacks “lying divinations” (כָּזָב) in God’s name. Our line compresses a moral world: courting unsubstantial goods and building one’s case on deception will, in time, invert honor and shame.

The verse ends with סֶלָה (Selah), an interpretive and performative pause. In recitation this is where the instruments might carry the rebuke forward, letting the accusations ring. The effect is theatrical: the prayer addresses adversaries directly, seizing the initiative. That move makes the next line—“Know that YHWH has set apart the faithful”—not a private consolation but a public correction. The psalm is not content to plead a case; it teaches one.

**Verse 4**

“וּדְעוּ כִּי־הִפְלָה יְהוָה חָסִיד לוֹ; יְהוָה יִשְׁמַע בְּקׇרְאִי אֵלָיו.” The imperative “know” (וּדְעוּ) calls for recognition that changes conduct. The verb הִפְלָה (hiphil of פָּלָא) here means “has distinguished, set apart” (Exod 9:4; 11:7), and often shades into the marvelous: God’s separating action is wondrous. The object is “חָסִיד,” the faithful one—one who practices covenant loyalty (חֶסֶד). Medieval readers vary the emphasis: Rashi reads “has separated”; Ibn Ezra “distinguished and made known”; Radak extends it to royal election—God “has separated me… to be king,” echoing Deut 10:8 on Levi. In any case, divine election renders the nobles’ calculus of honor and shame irrelevant.

The second cola form an inclusio with v. 2: “YHWH hears when I call” answers “Answer me when I call.” Note the verb change: the plea for “answer” yields the confidence of “hear.” In Hebrew poetics the two cola are not mere synonyms but a small progression: the first asserts a theological fact (set apart), the second draws its practical consequence (He hears when I call). This is a textbook example of parallelism as “A is so, and what’s more, B.”

**Verse 5**

“רִגְזוּ וְאַל־תֶּחֱטָאוּ; אִמְרוּ בִלְבַבְכֶם עַל־מִשְׁכַּבְכֶם וְדֹמּוּ סֶלָה.” The command sequence unfurls like a spiritual practice. First disturbance—“רִגְזוּ.” The verb can mean tremble, quake, be agitated, even rage. The Septuagint rendered “be angry,” which Paul cites in Ephesians 4:26 (“Be angry and do not sin”). Jewish readers most often hear reverent fear: Rashi, “tremble before the Holy One”; Radak, “fear God if you do not fear me.” The Babylonian Talmud (Berakhot 5a) preserves both layers. One teaching says, “Let the good impulse incite (יַרְגִּיז) the evil impulse”; if that fails, study Torah; if that fails, recite Shema; if that fails, remember the day of death—an ascetic ladder that builds directly on our verse’s steps. Another derives the halakhic practice of Kriat Shema al ha-Mitah (Shema at bedtime) from “on your beds.” Either way, the verse sketches an evening itinerary: acknowledge your agitation; refuse sin; let your internal speech take place in the off-hours; then stop speaking. The silence (דֹמּוּ) to which it leads is not passivity but poise. The Selah invites a musical hush.

The phrase “speak in your heart” (אִמְרוּ בִלְבַבְכֶם) is a standard biblical idiom for inner discourse (cf. Isa 47:8). Its coupling with “on your beds” makes the psalm’s practical wisdom concrete. Daytime clamor muffles conscience; the night returns attention. On the psalm’s own terms, this interior work is the prelude to public worship (v. 6) and restful sleep (v. 9).

**Verse 6**

“זִבְחוּ זִבְחֵי־צֶדֶק; וּבִטְחוּ אֶל־יְהוָה.” The line pairs outer rite and inner stance. “Sacrifices of righteousness” can mean sacrifices rightly offered (i.e., not perfunctory or compromised), or sacrifices that flow from repentance, or, as Psalm 51:21 has it, the offerings God actually desires once inner repair is done. Deuteronomy 33:19 uses the same phrase in a positive cultic sense. Radak presses against “the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination” (Prov 21:27): such men revert to evil after offering. Rashi, characteristically brief, turns the altar inward: “Make your deeds righteous, and it will be as if you offer sacrifices.” Ibn Ezra identifies these as peace offerings (שְׁלָמִים), the communal feast of gratitude rather than the expiatory offerings of guilt or sin.

The second colon, “trust in YHWH,” is the counterweight. Sacrifice without trust becomes manipulation; trust without sacrifice risks pious abstraction. The preposition “אֶל־יְהוָה” (to/toward YHWH) is a nice touch. Trust is not a static property; it has a direction.

**Verse 7**

“רַבִּים אֹמְרִים, מִי־יַרְאֵנוּ טוֹב; נְּסָה־עָלֵינוּ אוֹר פָּנֶיךָ יְהוָה.” The “many” may be the adversaries of v. 3, or a broader constituency wearied by lack: “Who will show us good?” The petition that follows—“Lift up the light of Your face”—quotes the priestly blessing (Num 6:25) and a frequent psalmic trope for favor (Ps 44:4; 89:16). The verb נְּסָה here is best taken as a spelling variant of “נשא” (to lift, raise), with samekh replacing shin (a known alternation): “raise upon us.” Rashi hears the same and glosses with Isa 62:10, “הָרִימוּ נֵס” (“lift up a banner”). The line thus places faithful liturgy into the mouths of the “many”—they ask for what Israel is taught to ask. The psalm’s counterpoint is not that the request is wrong but that the “good” is not exhausted by harvest statistics.

Liturgically, communities have taken the second half on its own as a plea for benevolent presence in seasons of judgment (Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur). That reception history fits the psalm’s movement. The next line will identify the “good” that *is* already given.

**Verse 8**

“נָתַתָּה שִׂמְחָה בְלִבִּי, מֵעֵת דְּגָנָם וְתִירוֹשָׁם רָבּוּ.” The construction “מֵעֵת” is the crux. If temporal: “You put joy in my heart at the time when their grain and wine multiplied.” If comparative: “more than when their grain and wine multiplied.” If causal in sense: “You put joy in my heart because their grain and wine multiplied,” i.e., generosity freed from rivalry. Medieval readers already offered all three. Radak dramatizes the magnanimous reading—while “they rejoice at my evil,” I have rejoiced at their good. Metzudat David prefers the comparative—joy in my portion exceeds their feast. Ibn Ezra notes God’s gift of a “good heart” that genuinely desires the good of all.

Two small details sharpen the contrast. First, the possessive: “their grain and their new wine,” not “ours.” The psalmist is outside the circle of visible prospering. Second, the pairing דָּגָן וְתִירוֹשׁ (“grain and new wine”) is a covenant merism for total agricultural blessing (Deut 7:13; 11:14). To name it is not to sneer; it is to situate it. In the psalm’s moral arithmetic, to ask, “Who will show us good?” (v. 7), is good; to receive “joy in my heart” is better—because it is the “good” that does not vanish when the bins empty. That is why the sleep of v. 9 can follow, even if “their” increase is not “mine.”

**Verse 9**

“בְּשָׁלוֹם יַחְדָּו אֶשְׁכְּבָה וְאִישָׁן; כִּי־אַתָּה יְהוָה לְבָדָד לָבֶטַח תּוֹשִׁיבֵנִי.” The adverb יַחְדָּו here carries temporal force—“at once,” lie down and sleep in one motion—over against the sleeplessness of anxiety (compare Ps 3:6: “I lay down and slept; I woke again, for YHWH sustained me”). Medieval readers who take “together” spatially (“with my people”) must supply a plural referent that the context does not provide. The phrase בְּשָׁלוֹם names not simply the absence of conflict but an all-around “wholeness” (shalom) that holds body, mind, and circumstance in quiet.

The theological center of gravity is לְבָדָד—“alone.” Grammatically it modifies “You, YHWH,” not the speaker. The claim is not isolation (“You make me dwell alone”) but sufficiency: You alone do this. The echo of Deuteronomy 33:28—“Israel dwells secure, alone (בָּדָד)… in a land of grain and wine”—gives the adverb flavor. There too, the point is not solitary existence but unthreatened dwelling under God’s own governance. Here the echo returns us to v. 8: whether or not “grain and wine” are presently mine, the security is God’s. The verb תּוֹשִׁיבֵנִי (“You make me dwell”) is causative (hiphil); the psalmist’s safety is not a mood but an enactment.

One can hear the psalm’s pedagogy come full circle. The nobles (v. 3) are rebuked and told to think (v. 5), to offer and to trust (v. 6). The “many” (v. 7) are given faithful words to say. The speaker testifies to a gift in the heart (v. 8) and an outcome in the body (v. 9). The music rests. The day is over.
