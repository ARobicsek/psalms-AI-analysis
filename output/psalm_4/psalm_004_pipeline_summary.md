## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (11)

1. What is the semantic field of כָבוֹד ('glory/honor') in v.3, and how does its transformation to 'shame' (כְלִמָּה) relate to honor/shame culture in ancient Israel? Is this personal reputation, divine glory, or both?
2. How does the divine epithet 'God of my righteousness/vindication' (אֱלֹהֵי צִדְקִי) function elsewhere in the Psalter and legal contexts? Does this suggest lawsuit/judicial imagery?
3. What is the exact meaning of רִגְזוּ in v.5—'tremble,' 'be angry,' or 'be agitated'? How does this relate to the Septuagint's ὀργίζω ('be angry') and Paul's citation in Ephesians 4:26?
4. What are 'sacrifices of righteousness' (זִבְחֵי־צֶדֶק) in v.6? Are these morally upright sacrifices, properly performed rituals, or metaphorical worship in righteousness? Compare with Psalm 51:19 and Deuteronomy 33:19.
5. How does the phrase 'the LORD singles out/makes wonderful' (הִפְלָה) the faithful relate to election theology? Is this about individual election or corporate identity of the חָסִיד (faithful/pious one)?
6. What is the relationship between the 'light of your face' request (v.7) and the Aaronic blessing (Numbers 6:24-26)? Is the psalmist critiquing or affirming this petition?
7. In v.8, the temporal clause 'when their grain and wine increase' (מֵעֵת דְּגָנָם וְתִירוֹשָׁם רָבּוּ)—is this contrast, concession, or temporal coincidence? Does the psalmist have material goods or not?
8. What does בְּשָׁלוֹם יַחְדָּו ('in peace together') mean in v.9? Together with whom—God, community, or is יַחְדָּו an adverb meaning 'at once/safely'?
9. How does the emphatic לְבָדָד ('alone') in v.9 function theologically—is this monotheistic confession (YHWH alone, not other gods), sufficiency (YHWH alone, not YHWH plus prosperity), or isolation (the psalmist alone with God)?
10. What is the function of the bed/sleep imagery in vv.5 and 9? Is this literal evening prayer, metaphorical rest from anxiety, or both? How does this relate to other sleep passages (Psalm 3:5, 127:2)?
11. How do the illusions/frauds (רִיק/כָזָב) that adversaries love in v.3 relate to idolatry language elsewhere? Are these false gods, false securities, or false accusations against the psalmist?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (12)

1. Why does the psalmist use the unique epithet 'God of my righteousness/vindication' (אֱלֹהֵי צִדְקִי) in v.2 - is this forensic/legal language suggesting a lawsuit context where God vindicates the psalmist's claim?
2. What is the semantic range and function of כָבוֹד (glory/honor) in v.3 - personal reputation in honor-shame culture, divine glory reflected in the psalmist, or material wealth? How does its transformation to כְלִמָּה (shame) work?
3. What does רִגְזוּ mean in v.5 - 'tremble' (in fear of God), 'be angry' (LXX and Paul's reading), or 'be agitated'? How does this choice affect the instruction's meaning - is anger legitimate if it doesn't lead to sin?
4. What are 'sacrifices of righteousness' (זִבְחֵי־צֶדֶק) in v.6 - morally upright sacrifices, properly performed rituals according to Torah, or metaphorical worship? How does this relate to prophetic critique of empty ritual?
5. How should מֵעֵת in v.8 be interpreted - comparative ('more than when their grain...'), temporal ('at the time when their grain...'), or causal ('because their grain...')? This determines whether the psalmist lacks prosperity or transcends it
6. Who are 'the many' (רַבִּים) in v.7 - are they the same as the 'sons of men' adversaries from v.3, or the broader community including sympathetic voices? Is their prayer for divine blessing legitimate or misguided?
7. What does the verb הִפְלָה mean in v.4 - 'set apart,' 'make wonderful/marvelous,' 'distinguish,' or 'show favor'? Is this about individual election or corporate identity of the חָסִיד (faithful/pious)?
8. How does יַחְדָּו function in v.9 - 'together' (with God, implying intimate communion), 'together' (with community), 'at once' (both lie down and sleep simultaneously), or 'safely/altogether'?
9. What is the theological force of לְבָדָד ('alone') in v.9 - monotheistic confession (YHWH alone not other gods), sufficiency claim (YHWH alone not YHWH plus prosperity), or isolation (psalmist alone with God in solitude)?
10. Why does the psalm address adversaries directly (vv.3-6) rather than complaining about them to God - what rhetorical or liturgical function does this confrontational instruction serve?
11. How does the priestly blessing allusion in v.7 ('lift up the light of your face') function - is the psalmist affirming this request but redefining fulfillment, or critiquing conventional piety that seeks visible signs?
12. What is the relationship between the evening setting (bed, sleep, lie down) and the psalm's theological argument about competing securities - why is nighttime the appropriate frame for this teaching?
