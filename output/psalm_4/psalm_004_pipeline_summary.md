## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (11)

1. What is the precise force of אֱלֹהֵי צִדְקִי in v2—'God of my righteousness,' 'God my vindicator,' or 'my righteous God'? How does this relate to 'sacrifices of righteousness' (זִבְחֵי־צֶדֶק) in v6?
2. How does the spatial metaphor בַּצָּר הִרְחַבְתָּ (narrow→wide) function elsewhere in Psalms and ANE literature? Is this purely metaphorical or does it evoke specific experiences (siege, childbirth, legal confinement)?
3. What does כָבוֹד ('glory/honor') signify in v3? Is this the psalmist's reputation, his dignity, or a more technical term (divine glory reflected in the righteous)? Why is it vulnerable to being made לִכְלִמָּה ('a shame')?
4. What is the meaning of הִפְלָה in v4 ('singles out,' 'distinguishes,' 'works wonders for')? Does this suggest election theology, or miraculous intervention, or both?
5. How should רִגְזוּ be translated in v5—'tremble' (in fear), 'be angry,' or 'be perturbed'? How does each reading affect the interpretation of 'sin no more'? What is the relationship to Ephesians 4:26's citation?
6. What is the logical sequence in vv5-6 from introspection (v5) to sacrifice (v6)? Is this a process of repentance, or instruction in proper worship order?
7. How does נְסָה־עָלֵינוּ אוֹר פָּנֶיךָ ('lift upon us the light of your face') in v7 relate to the Aaronic blessing (Num 6:25) and other 'face of God' texts? Is this a liturgical quotation?
8. Is the triad in v8 (grain and wine; LXX adds oil) simply agricultural or does it evoke specific covenant blessing formulas (Deut 7:13; 11:14; Hos 2:8-9)? Why compare divine joy to material abundance?
9. Does לְבָדָד in v9 modify 'You, LORD, alone' (אַתָּה יְהוָה לְבָדָד) or 'me alone in security' (לָבֶטַח תּוֹשִׁיבֵנִי)? What are the syntactic and theological implications of each reading?
10. How does Psalm 4 relate literarily to Psalm 3 (both mention lying down/sleeping, enemies, morning/evening)? Are they a deliberately paired sequence?
11. What is the social situation: personal enemies, economic rivals, or religious opponents? Who are the בְּנֵי אִישׁ ('sons of man/men of rank') in v3—nobles, or generic humanity?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (12)

1. What is the precise semantic range of הִפְלָה in v4 - does it emphasize divine election, miraculous intervention, or distinction/separation, and how does each reading alter the theology?
2. How should רִגְזוּ in v5 be translated - 'tremble' (in religious awe), 'be angry' (moral indignation), or 'be agitated' (anxiety) - and how does this affect the logical connection to 'sin no more'?
3. Is the לְבָדָד in v9 syntactically attached to 'You LORD alone' (monotheistic emphasis) or to 'me dwelling alone in security' (psychological self-sufficiency through God)?
4. What exactly are זִבְחֵי־צֶדֶק ('sacrifices of righteousness') in v6 - ethically correct sacrifices, sacrifices offered by the righteous, or sacrifices that produce righteousness?
5. Does the temporal/comparative מֵעֵת in v8 mean 'from/since the time when' (temporal simultaneity) or 'more than' (quantitative superiority), and how does this affect the comparison?
6. What is the significance of בְּנֵי אִישׁ in v3 - generic 'mortals,' or social class 'men of rank/nobility' - and how does this identification affect the conflict's nature?
7. How does כָבוֹד ('glory') in v3 function - is this personal reputation/honor, divine glory reflected in the righteous, or a technical theological term?
8. What does the יַחְדָּו ('together/at once') contribute in v9 - are lying down and sleeping unified as single restful action, or does it suggest something else?
9. Is the טוֹב ('good') in v7 material prosperity, ethical goodness, or existential well-being - and does this align with deuteronomic blessing theology or subvert it?
10. How does the spatial metaphor בַּצָּר הִרְחַבְתָּ (narrow→wide) in v2 function - architectural, geographical, psychological, or legal (siege, landscape, anxiety, confinement)?
11. Why does the LXX add 'oil' to the grain-and-wine formula in v8, creating the full covenant blessing triad?
12. What is the relationship between introspective commands in v5 (speak in heart, ponder on bed, be silent) and ritual command in v6 (offer sacrifices) - repentance process or proper worship sequence?
