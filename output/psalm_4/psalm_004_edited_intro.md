Psalm 4 is an evening psalm—yet not because it whispers. Its voice is steady, direct, even instructional. The speaker calls for an answer (v. 2), turns and rebukes “sons of man” (v. 3), issues commands (vv. 5–6), then returns to quiet joy and untroubled sleep (v. 9). If lament normally devotes itself to complaint about enemies before God, this poet faces the adversaries squarely and teaches. The theological claim that emerges is simple enough to memorize and difficult to live: the good that truly secures a life is not the visible increase of “grain and wine” but the inward gift of joy that God places in the heart (v. 8). The bed, at day’s end, is where that lesson can be learned.

Two patterns frame the psalm. First, an inclusio—that is, a framing repetition—encloses the opening plea with the assurance of hearing. “Answer me when I call… hear my prayer” (v. 2) is answered within the psalm itself: “YHWH hears when I call to Him” (v. 4). Second, the evening frame: the admonition to ponder “on your bed” (v. 5) is answered by “In peace I lie down and sleep” (v. 9). The logic is not mystical but practical: quiet self-scrutiny leads to quiet rest.

A distinctive divine epithet begins the prayer: אֱלֹהֵי צִדְקִי, “God of my righteousness/vindication” (v. 2). The term צֶדֶק (tzedek) is not mere moralism; it is forensic—rightness in a contested case (BDB s.v.). To invoke “the God of my vindication” is to place one’s cause before the Judge who can restore honor publicly. The psalm immediately reaches for a physical metaphor to describe deliverance: “In the straits (בַּצָּר) You made wide for me (הִרְחַבְתָּ לִּי).” This is not a metaphor invented here. The move from constriction to “broad place” is a well-loved biblical way of naming rescue: “From distress I called on Yah; Yah answered me with freedom” (מִן־הַמֵּצַר… בַמֶּרְחָב, Ps 118:5); “He brought me out to a broad place” (Ps 18:20); “Bring me out of my straits” (Ps 25:17). Pressed and hemmed in—then room to breathe.

The poem pivots abruptly: “Sons of man (בְּנֵי אִישׁ), how long will my glory be [turned] to shame?” (v. 3). The phrase בְּנֵי אִישׁ typically marks elites, not the general populace (compare Ps 49:3; 62:10). The conflict is described in the honor-shame idiom of the ancient Mediterranean: כָּבוֹד (kavod, “glory,” a person’s social weight) is being treated as כְּלִמָּה (kelimah, “ignominy”). The charge is threefold: they love רִיק (riq, “emptiness, illusion”), they seek כָזָב (kazav, “falsehood”), and they aim to reverse the psalmist’s honor. The vocabulary has theological teeth. Elsewhere רִיק and its cousins (הֶבֶל, “vapor, non-gods,” Deut 32:21) and כָזָב (“lie,” often for false prophecy, Ezek 13:8–9) signal idolatrous trust in “nothings.” The structure is sapiential: the speaker contrasts two ways of seeking the good.

What follows is instruction rather than diatribe. “Know (וּדְעוּ)—and in biblical Hebrew ‘know’ conveys recognition leading to action—that YHWH has הִפְלָה (hiflah) the faithful one for Himself” (v. 4). The verb, hiphil of פָּלָא, is used for “setting apart, distinguishing” (Exod 9:4; 11:7), and carries a sense of God’s wondrous differentiating action. The medievals press the same point from different angles: Rashi glosses simply “has separated”; Ibn Ezra, “distinguished and made known”; Radak takes it as royal election—God separated David “from all Israel to be king.” The noun חָסִיד (chasid) names the “faithful”—not the sentimental “pious,” but one who practices covenant loyalty (חֶסֶד). That public setting-apart answers the honor crisis; it also underwrites the bold line that follows: “YHWH hears when I call to Him.”

Then the nocturne: “רִגְזוּ (rigzu) and do not sin; speak in your hearts on your beds, and be silent” (v. 5). What does רִגְזוּ mean? The root can mean tremble, quake, be agitated, even rage. The ancient Greek translation (the Septuagint, “LXX”) chose “be angry,” and the Apostle Paul famously cited it that way (Ephesians 4:26). Jewish tradition tended to hear “tremble [before God],” with Rashi and Radak drawing the sense toward reverent fear. The Talmud both preserves and repurposes the line. In one strand it regulates bedtime piety—recite Shema on your bed and be silent (Berakhot 4b–5a). In another, it turns the verb into a psychological practice: “A person should always incite (יַרְגִּיז) the good inclination against the evil inclination” (Berakhot 5a). Either way, the sequence is crucial: disturbance (emotional or moral), then restraint (“and do not sin”), then inward speech in the night hours, then quiet. Evening exposes our inner weather; the psalm tells us what to do with it.

The next imperative is cultic and moral in a single phrase: “Offer sacrifices of righteousness (זִבְחֵי־צֶדֶק), and trust in YHWH” (v. 6). The genitive can bear more than one shade: sacrifices rightly offered; sacrifices that flow from repentance; sacrifices God actually desires (compare Ps 51:21: “Then You will desire sacrifices of righteousness…”; Deut 33:19). Radak ties it to genuine repentance; Rashi spiritualizes: “Make your deeds righteous, and it will be as if you offer sacrifices.” The point is doubled: external rite and inward trust go together—or else the rite is hollow.

Who are the “many” of v. 7? “Many are saying, ‘Who will show us good?’ Lift up the light of Your face upon us, YHWH.” The phrase plays two ways at once. On the one hand, it quotes faithful liturgy: “the light of Your face” is the heart of the priestly blessing (Num 6:25), and psalms use it for concrete divine favor (Ps 44:4; 89:16). On the other hand, the question “Who will show us good?” can turn anxious or cynical, especially when the “good” is measured by harvests and vintage. The psalm does not sneer at that desire; Torah itself promises “grain and wine” to the obedient (Deut 7:13). But it does contrast two reckonings of blessing.

“You have put joy in my heart—more than when their grain and their new wine increased” (v. 8). The small preposition מֵעֵת (me’et) is the hinge. It can read temporally (“at the time when”), comparatively (“more than when”), or even causally in sense (“because”). The medievals already take sides: Radak hears the temporal—“I rejoiced at their prosperity, even while they rejoice at my ill”—an achievement of magnanimity. Metzudat David prefers the comparative: an inward gift surpasses outward plenty. Ibn Ezra, subtle as always, hears God giving a “good heart” that genuinely desires the good of all. Each reading carries moral weight, but the contrastive sense fits the psalm’s architecture: the “many” seek visible increase; the speaker testifies to a deeper sufficiency, a joy not hostage to circumstance.

The closing verse returns to the bed and then beyond it. “In peace, יַחְדָּו (yachdav), I lie down and sleep, for You, YHWH, לְבָדָד (levadad), make me dwell secure” (v. 9). Both adverbs deserve a moment. יַחְדָּו can mean “together” (with others) or “at once.” In this context the temporal force is persuasive: lying down and sleeping come “in one motion,” an immediacy denied to the anxious (so the medieval Metzudat David). לְבָדָד plainly modifies the subject (“You, YHWH, alone”), though its echo of Deuteronomy 33:28 (“Israel dwells secure, alone… in a land of grain and wine”) does more work: God’s sufficiency is not a bare monotheism; it is monergism—the claim that security is God’s doing, not God plus affluence, allies, or self-care. That is why the psalmist can teach the enemies (vv. 3–6) without fear and can sleep (v. 9) without delay. The bed is the right school for such a claim. Night strips away visible supports. If a joy “given in the heart” still hums after the lights are out, it is real.

A few guideposts for readers. “Inclusio” names the framing repetition that brackets a unit; “colon” here means a poetic line in a parallel pair; “LXX” refers to the Septuagint, an ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, often useful for hearing how early readers understood a line. Those labels matter much less than the psalm’s simple invitation: let the day still enough for honest thought, offer what you have to God, and trust. The sleep that follows is the theology.

#### Full psalm

In several traditions, Psalm 4 is an evening psalm for the holiest night of the year. In the Edot HaMizrach (Eastern) rite, it is recited in full at Yom Kippur Maariv as part of the introductory psalms that set a penitential tone: “בְּקׇרְאִי עֲנֵנִי אֱלֹהֵי צִדְקִי” (“Answer me when I call, O God of my vindication,” Ps 4:2) resonates with the day’s plea for mercy. Some Ashkenazic machzorim likewise include Psalm 4 among the prefaces to the Kol Nidrei service.

#### Key verses

Psalm 4:2. בְּקׇרְאִי עֲנֵנִי אֱלֹהֵי צִדְקִי (“When I call, answer me, O God of my vindication”). In the High Holiday prayers (Edot HaMizrach), this line is woven into the Seder HaAvodah of Yom Kippur Mussaf: “בְּקָרְאִי עֲנֵנִי אֱלֹהֵי צִדְקִי” appears in poetic petitions that model the congregation’s cry for a favorable judgment. Similarly, Selichot and Yom Kippur Katan piyyutim echo this verse to frame the community’s plea: “בְּקָרְאֵנוּ עֲנֵנוּ אֱלֹהֵי יִשְׁעֵנוּ… חָנֵּנוּ וּשְׁמַע תְּפִלָּתֵנוּ” (“When we call, answer us, O God of our salvation… be gracious and hear our prayer”).

Psalm 4:4. יְהוָה יִשְׁמַע בְּקׇרְאִי אֵלָיו (“YHWH will hear when I call to Him”). In the Yom Kippur evening Selichot (Edot HaMizrach), this assurance is quoted amid verses of divine compassion, giving doctrinal spine to the night’s confessions: the God who distinguishes His faithful (חָסִיד) hears.

Psalm 4:5. רִגְזוּ וְאַל תֶּחֱטָאוּ… עַל־מִשְׁכַּבְכֶם וְדֹמּוּ (“Tremble and do not sin… on your beds, be silent”). This is the cornerstone of Kriat Shema al ha-Mitah, the bedtime Shema. The liturgy instructs: “רִגְזוּ וְאַל תֶּחֱטָאוּ אִמְרוּ בִלְבַבְכֶם עַל־מִשְׁכַּבְכֶם וְדֹמּוּ סֶלָה” (recited thrice), directing worshipers to reflect and quiet themselves before sleep. The Talmud (Berakhot 4b–5a) cites the verse to require Shema at bedtime and to map a spiritual sequence: provoke the good impulse, study Torah, recite Shema, then pray—an interpretive ladder derived from the verse’s order.

#### Phrases

Psalm 4:7. נְּסָה־עָלֵינוּ אוֹר פָּנֶיךָ יְהוָה (“Lift upon us the light of Your face, O YHWH”). In High Holiday piyyutim (Edot HaMizrach), this phrase is inserted as a petition for divine favor during judgment: “נְּסָה־עָלֵינוּ אוֹר פָּנֶיךָ יְהוָה,” echoing the priestly blessing (Numbers 6:25). Liturgically, the line tilts the psalm’s contrast toward the true “good”: God’s face rather than produce.

The liturgical uses both confirm the psalm’s plain sense (nighttime reflection; trust that God hears) and carry it further. Bedtime practice turns v. 5 from a rebuke to opponents into a discipline for the faithful; the High Holiday insertions underscore the psalm’s courtroom language—“God of my vindication”—within communal confession.
