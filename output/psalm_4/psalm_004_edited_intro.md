Psalm 4 is not labeled “evening prayer” in its heading. Its superscription—לַמְנַצֵּחַ בִּנְגִינוֹת, “for the leader; with stringed instruments”—belongs to the language of performance, not time. Yet the poem ends in the dark: “In peace, together, I lie down and sleep; for You, YHWH, alone make me dwell secure” (v. 9). The bed becomes a testing ground for theology. One can say “trust” all day; the moment of truth is whether the mind can release its tight grip when the light goes out.

The opening line condenses the psalm’s logic of prayer: “בְּקׇרְאִי עֲנֵנִי אֱלֹהֵי צִדְקִי; בַצָּר הִרְחַבְתָּ לִּי—חָנֵּנִי וּשְׁמַע תְּפִלָּתִי” (“Answer me when I call, O God of my vindication; in straits You made room for me—be gracious to me and hear my prayer,” v. 2). The epithet אֱלֹהֵי צִדְקִי (Elohei tzidqi) is grammatically elastic and theologically precise: the God characterized by righteousness; the God who establishes or reveals my right; the God who vindicates. This word returns as צֶדֶק in v. 6 (“sacrifices of righteousness”), forming an inclusio—an envelope device that signals a central theme—around plea and response. The spatial metaphor “in narrowness you made wide” recurs elsewhere to mean release from pressure: “Indeed, he wooed you out of the mouth of distress to a broad place” (Job 36:16); “deliver me from my straits” (Psalm 25:17). Here, memory of past widening gives the courage to ask for present grace.

Then the poem pivots outward and upward. “בְּנֵי אִישׁ, עַד־מֶה כְבוֹדִי לִכְלִמָּה; תֶּאֱהָבוּן רִיק, תְּבַקְשׁוּ כָזָב” (“You men of rank, how long will my honor be shamed? Will you love emptiness, seek falsehood?” v. 3). In Psalms, בְּנֵי אִישׁ (“sons of man”) often denotes the elite (compare Psalm 49:3; 62:10), sharpening the social conflict. Their strategy is the pursuit of “emptiness” (רִיק) and “falsehood” (כָזָב)—the biblical idiom for illusions that don’t hold. The poet does not simply lament; he instructs: “וּדְעוּ כִּי־הִפְלָה יְהוָה חָסִיד לוֹ” (“Know that YHWH has set apart the faithful for himself,” v. 4). The verb הִפְלָה (Hiphil of פלא) can mean “distinguish” (Exodus 11:7; 9:4) and, by association with פלא, “act wondrously.” Both senses fit: election is the wonder.

Verses 5–6 are the psalm’s moral program in five verbs: “רִגְזוּ וְאַל תֶּחֱטָאוּ; אִמְרוּ בִלְבַבְכֶם עַל־מִשְׁכַּבְכֶם; וְדֹמּוּ. זִבְחוּ זִבְחֵי־צֶדֶק; וּבִטְחוּ אֶל־יְהוָה.” The first word, רִגְזוּ, can mean “tremble,” “be shaken,” or “be angry.” The Septuagint has “Be angry and do not sin,” which Paul quotes (Ephesians 4:26). But in context, “tremble” in awe (Rashi, Radak) suits the sequence: fear—internal self-talk—silence—right worship—trust. The Talmud (Berakhot 4b–5a) famously reads this verse as an evening discipline: incite the good impulse against the evil; if not, study; if not, recite the Shema; if not, “remind oneself of the day of death”—a fear that segues to silence. The bed (“עַל־מִשְׁכַּבְכֶם”) is where the heart’s unfiltered voice is audible.

“זִבְחֵי־צֶדֶק” (v. 6) is a phrase that appears only three times (Deuteronomy 33:19; Psalm 4:6; 51:21). The tradition reads it ethically: sacrifices offered rightly—by the righteous, as part of a true turning (Radak, Psalm 51). Ibn Ezra narrows it to thanksgiving offerings (שְׁלָמִים), not guilt offerings; Malbim, reading historically, takes them as “thanksgiving offerings because David’s righteousness was clarified” (following 2 Samuel 21). Whatever the cultic specificity, v. 6 pairs deed and disposition: right worship, and a turning of confidence toward YHWH—וּבִטְחוּ אֶל־יְהוָה.

Verses 7–8 place two kinds of “good” side by side. “רַבִּים אֹמְרִים: מִי יַרְאֵנוּ טוֹב?” (“Many say, Who will show us good?”). The poet’s answer is not an argument but a counter-petition: “נְסָה עָלֵינוּ אוֹר פָּנֶיךָ, יְהוָה” (“Lift upon us the light of Your face, YHWH,” v. 7). The collocation “light of your face” is rare and charged, clustered around blessing and favor (Psalm 4:7; 44:4; 89:16; Proverbs 16:15) and echoing the priestly words “יָאֵר יְהוָה פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ” (“May YHWH make His face shine upon you,” Numbers 6:25). The verb נְסָה is best taken, as Ibn Ezra notes, as a defective spelling of Hiphil נָשָׂא—“lift,” not “test.” The point is simple: the good the “many” demand to see is not harvest tallies but the experience of divine favor. The next line seals it: “נָתַתָּה שִׂמְחָה בְלִבִּי מֵעֵת דְּגָנָם וְתִירוֹשָׁם רָבוּ” (v. 8). The preposition מֵעֵת here is comparative: “more than when their grain and wine increased.” “Grain and wine” is a merism—two items named to imply the whole—standing for agricultural abundance (Deuteronomy 7:13; 11:14). The Greek translators, hearing the Deuteronomic cadence, sometimes add “oil.” Psalm 4 resists no material good; it reduces no joy. It simply ranks them. The heart’s joy, bestowed by God, can outweigh your neighbor’s bumper crop.

The final verse returns to the bed—now as sanctuary, not battleground. “בְּשָׁלוֹם יַחְדָּו אֶשְׁכְּבָה וְאִישָׁן, כִּי־אַתָּה יְהוָה לְבָדָד לָבֶטַח תּוֹשִׁיבֵנִי” (v. 9). יַחְדָּו may mean “together” (with my own people reconciled) or “at once” (lie down and fall asleep without delay). Either way, the cause is the same: “for You, YHWH, alone” (לְבָדָד). The adverb can attach to YHWH (only You do this) or to the speaker (You make me dwell securely even alone). Deuteronomy 33:28—“וַיִּשְׁכֹּן יִשְׂרָאֵל בֶּטַח, בָּדָד”—hovers behind the line. There the nation’s security is linked to “grain and wine”; here it is located in God’s agency, even when the storehouses are someone else’s.

Two literary notes help the reader navigate. First, the poem’s Selah markers (vv. 3, 5) punctuate the argument: the first ends the accusation; the second seals the inward turn. Second, the psalm forms a quiet pair with Psalm 3. There, the speaker lays down, sleeps, and awakens (3:6)—a morning confidence. Here, the poem ends at the threshold of sleep—a night trust. Between dawn and dusk, the theology is the same: memory of past widening; instruction of the heart; a more luminous good.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

#### Full psalm

Several Sephardic/Mizrahi communities recite the entirety of Psalm 4 at Yom Kippur Maariv as part of a preparatory suite with Psalms 1–3 and 24. The placement—on a night of fasting and confession—lets the psalm’s evening logic do its work: “בְּשָׁלוֹם יַחְדָּו אֶשְׁכְּבָה וְאִישָׁן… לָבֶטַח תּוֹשִׁיבֵנִי” (“In peace I lie down and sleep… You make me dwell secure,” v. 9). Its rehearsal after a day without food underlines the argument that joy and safety are not anchored in “grain and wine” (v. 8).

#### Key verses

“רִגְזוּ וְאַל־תֶּחֱטָאוּ; אִמְרוּ בִלְבַבְכֶם עַל־מִשְׁכַּבְכֶם; וְדֹמּוּ” (4:5). “Tremble and do not sin; speak in your hearts upon your beds; and be silent.” This verse stands at the heart of the K’riat Shema al HaMitah (Bedtime Shema) in both Ashkenazic and Sephardic rites. Many versions instruct: “יאמר כל פסוק ג״פ: רִגְזוּ וְאַל תֶּחֱטָאוּ אִמְרוּ בִלְבַבְכֶם עַל מִשְׁכַּבְכֶם וְדֹמּוּ סֶלָה” (“Each verse shall be recited three times: ‘Tremble and do not sin; speak in your hearts upon your beds, and be silent, Selah’”). Its liturgical use transforms the psalm’s counsel into a nightly practice of self-examination and quieting.

“בְּשָׁלוֹם יַחְדָּו אֶשְׁכְּבָה וְאִישָׁן…” (4:9). “In peace, together, I lie down and sleep.” Many Bedtime Shema orders include this line as a capstone to the protective psalms (Psalms 91 and 3) and personal prayers, enacting the psalm’s test: can one, after confession and trust, actually sleep?

#### Phrases

“בְּקָרְאִי עֲנֵנִי” (4:2). “When I call, answer me.” In Yom Kippur Katan Selichot and fast-day services (e.g., Ta’anit Esther), the phrase appears in supplicatory strings: “עִמְּךָ מְקוֹר חַיִּים, בְּאוֹרְךָ נִרְאֶה אוֹר; בְּקָרְאֵנוּ עֲנֵנִי אֱלֹהֵי יִשְׁעֵנוּ; בַּצָּר הִרְחַבְתָּ לָנוּ, חָנֵּנוּ וּשְׁמַע תְּפִלָּתֵנוּ” (“With You is the source of life; in Your light we see light. When we call, answer us, O God of our salvation. In distress You have made room for us; be gracious to us and hear our prayer”). The pairing of “distress” and “widening” preserves the psalm’s metaphor while turning it into communal plea.

“נְסָה עָלֵינוּ אוֹר פָּנֶיךָ” (4:7). “Lift upon us the light of Your face.” In Edot HaMizrach High Holiday liturgy (Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur), the phrase is embedded in the Amidah’s repetition: “תָּכִין לִבָּם, תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ; נְסָה עָלֵינוּ אוֹר פָּנֶיךָ, יְהוָה” (“Prepare their hearts; incline Your ear; lift upon us the light of Your face, YHWH”). The liturgy hears Psalm 4 as a petition for favor rather than prosperity—a perfect fit for the Days of Awe.

“כִּי־הִפְלָה יְהוָה חָסִיד לוֹ” (4:4). “For YHWH has set apart the faithful for Himself.” In some Sephardic traditions, the line appears in Shabbat Zachor piyyutim (“Mi Kamocha”), where it is read through Esther’s hidden deliverance: God distinguishes His faithful even when providence seems opaque. The liturgical reuse emphasizes election and hearing: “יְהוָה יִשְׁמַע בְּקָרְאִי” (“YHWH hears when I call,” 4:4).
