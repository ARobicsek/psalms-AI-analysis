# Introduction Essay

Psalm 4 belongs to a category of biblical prayer so deceptively simple that it conceals its own sophistication. Cast as an evening prayer, the psalm moves through multiple registers—petition, instruction, testimony—addressing God, adversaries, and the reader in turn. The result is less a conventional lament than a wisdom meditation in prayer form, staged at the liminal hour when the day's anxieties give way to trust. The psalmist's central claim is audacious: that joy rooted in divine presence surpasses even the abundance of harvest time.

The opening petition establishes the psalm's rhetorical foundation. The speaker addresses "God of my vindication" (אֱלֹהֵי צִדְקִי, *elohei tzidki*)—a unique epithet appearing only here in the Psalter. The phrase signals more than mere piety; it positions God as the one who vindicates the speaker's righteousness against detractors. This forensic undertone runs throughout: the psalmist is defending honor (*kavod*) against shame (*kelimah*), truth against fraud. The spatial metaphor that follows—"in distress you freed me" (בַּצָּר הִרְחַבְתָּ לִּי, *batzar hirchavta li*)—uses the familiar Hebrew image of constriction and expansion to describe deliverance. As Radak notes, this movement from *tzar* (narrowness) to *merchav* (spaciousness) appears repeatedly in psalmic prayer, suggesting not merely rescue but the restoration of dignified space in which to live.

Then comes the psalm's dramatic pivot. Without warning, the speaker turns from God to address "sons of man" (בְּנֵי אִישׁ, *benei ish*) directly: "How long will you turn my glory to shame?" This confrontational shift is unusual in lament psalms, which typically complain *about* enemies to God rather than *at* them. Here the psalmist seizes the rhetorical initiative, instructing adversaries as if they were wayward pupils. The triple accusation—that they love *riq* (emptiness/illusion), seek *kazav* (fraud/lie), and dishonor the speaker's *kavod* (glory/honor)—introduces the psalm's central antithesis between two ways of seeking "the good." The terms *riq* and *kazav* have theological overtones; elsewhere they denote idols, those empty nothings that promise substance but deliver air. The adversaries pursue hollow securities, chasing what cannot satisfy.

The didactic section that follows (verses 5-6) compounds the instruction with seven imperatives in rapid succession: tremble (*rigzu*), sin not, ponder in your heart, on your bed, be silent, offer sacrifices of righteousness, trust in the LORD. This cascade creates an urgency that belies the evening's calm. But what does *rigzu* mean? The verb's semantic range includes trembling, anger, and agitation. The Septuagint chose "be angry" (*orgizesthe*), a reading Paul would later cite in Ephesians 4:26 ("Be angry and do not sin"). Yet the Targum and most medieval Jewish commentators understood it as "tremble" in reverent fear. Ibn Ezra's gloss captures both: "tremble out of fear of HaShem." The ambiguity may be deliberate—the adversaries should feel the unsettling fear of divine judgment even as they check the impulse to sin in their agitation.

The bed imagery that frames this instruction is crucial. "Ponder... on your bed" (*imru bilvavkhem al mishkavkhem*) situates reflection at day's end, that threshold moment when external demands cease and internal reckoning begins. The imperative to "be silent" (*vedomu*) completes the movement: from daytime bustle to evening stillness, from external noise to internal truth. This liturgical timing is not incidental. As the Talmud (Berakhot 4b) notes, Rabbi Joshua ben Levi interpreted this verse as mandating the recitation of the Shema at bedtime, linking the psalm's evening contemplation to Israel's foundational confession of faith.

The call to "offer sacrifices of righteousness" (זִבְחֵי־צֶדֶק, *zivchei tzedek*) has puzzled interpreters. Are these morally upright sacrifices? Properly performed rituals? Or something else? The phrase appears elsewhere only in Deuteronomy 33:19 and Psalm 51:21, both contexts suggesting authentic worship as opposed to empty ritual. Radak understood it as sacrifices offered in genuine repentance, not like "the sacrifice of the wicked" (Proverbs 21:27) who return to their wickedness afterward. Rashi spiritualized it entirely: "Make your deeds righteous, and it will be as if you are offering sacrifices." The imperative to "trust in the LORD" immediately follows, pairing external rite with internal disposition—a recurring biblical insistence that cult without trust is hollow.

Verse 7 introduces a new voice. "Many say, 'Who will show us good?'" The identity of these *rabbim* (many) matters. Are they the same adversaries from verse 3, or a broader community expressing legitimate anxiety? The phrase echoes the perennial question of theodicy: where is divine blessing in a world of scarcity? Their petition—"Lift up the light of Your countenance upon us, O LORD" (*nesah aleinu or panekha YHWH*)—directly quotes the Aaronic blessing of Numbers 6:25-26. This is no mere cliché. The priestly benediction was Israel's premier liturgical prayer for divine favor, the paradigmatic expression of blessing. The "many" are invoking proper theology, proper liturgy, proper vocabulary. Yet something in their request troubles the psalmist.

The psalm's theological climax arrives in verse 8: "You put joy in my heart more than when their grain and wine increased" (*natata simchah velibi me'et deganam vetiroshsam ravu*). The temporal clause (*me'et*) is syntactically ambiguous. Does it mean "more than" (comparative), "at the time when" (temporal), or "because" (causal)? The uncertainty is interpretively generative. If comparative, the psalmist has joy exceeding material prosperity—a clear contrast to the "many" who seek visible abundance. If temporal, the psalmist's joy coincides with others' harvest bounty, suggesting contentment even while witnessing others' success. If causal, the psalmist's joy paradoxically arises *because* others prosper—a remarkable claim to vicarious joy without envy.

The possessive pronoun clinches the contrast: "their grain and wine," not ours. The speaker observes others' agricultural increase from outside. *Dagan* (grain) and *tirosh* (new wine) form a merism representing total covenant blessing, the material plenty promised in Deuteronomy 7:13 and 11:14. The "many" of verse 7 seek this tangible proof of divine favor—more grain, more wine, more visible blessing. They are not wrong to want it; the Torah itself promises such prosperity to the obedient. Yet the psalmist testifies to a sufficiency beyond circumstance: joy given directly to the heart (*velibi*), not mediated through external conditions.

This is the psalm's engine: the competition between two paradigms of blessing. One locates security in visible prosperity, asking "Who will show us good?" and pleading for the priestly benediction to materialize in harvest bounty. The other finds sufficiency in God's immediate presence, requiring neither abundance nor its absence to sustain joy. The psalm does not condemn the first; it simply witnesses to the second as more reliable, more fundamental. As Radak notes, the speaker rejoices in others' prosperity without needing to possess it—a spiritual achievement the rabbis would later codain as the antithesis of envy.

The closing verse completes the evening frame begun in verse 5. "In peace together I lie down and sleep, for You, O LORD, alone make me dwell in safety" (*beshalom yachdav eshkevah ve'ishan ki atah YHWH levadad lavetach toshiveni*). The syntax is dense with meaning. *Yachdav* (together) could mean the speaker sleeps alongside community, or that lying down and sleeping occur in immediate succession—no anxious gap between intention and rest. The emphatic *levadad* (alone) is theologically weighted: YHWH alone, not in combination with prosperity or security measures or human alliance, provides *betach* (safety). This echoes Deuteronomy 33:28's blessing: "Israel dwells in safety, alone (*badad*), the fountain of Jacob, in a land of grain and wine." The allusion links personal trust to corporate security, individual sleep to national well-being.

The psalm thus moves from evening petition through confrontational instruction to concluding testimony. Its rhetorical brilliance lies in making the reader overhear multiple conversations: the speaker to God, the speaker to adversaries, the adversaries to God, the speaker to us. Each addressee shift reorients perspective, creating a three-dimensional drama of competing claims about blessing. The psalm's enduring power emerges from its refusal to demonize the desire for prosperity while insisting on a deeper source of joy—one that the evening quiet, paradoxically, reveals more clearly than the day's busy quest for "good." In the liminal space between waking and sleep, the psalmist demonstrates what trust looks like: not the absence of desire but its reorientation toward the one who gives rest.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

Individual verses and phrases from Psalm 4 appear throughout the daily Jewish liturgy, though the psalm is not recited in its entirety in regular prayer services. Verse 2, "Answer me when I call, O God, my vindicator" (בְּקׇרְאִי עֲנֵנִי אֱלֹהֵי צִדְקִי), opens the private supplications (*Taḥanun*) recited on weekdays after the Amidah in some traditions. This placement interprets the verse as a paradigmatic petition for divine response in distress.

Most significantly, verse 5 became foundational for the practice of reciting the Shema before sleep. The Talmud (Berakhot 4b-5a) cites Rabbi Joshua ben Levi's ruling that even one who has recited the evening Shema in synagogue must repeat it upon retiring, deriving this practice from Psalm 4:5: "Tremble and do not sin; ponder in your heart upon your bed and be silent" (רִגְזוּ וְאַל־תֶּחֱטָאוּ אִמְרוּ בִלְבַבְכֶם עַל־מִשְׁכַּבְכֶם וְדֹמּוּ סֶלָה). Rabbi Levi bar Ḥama further developed this into a spiritual ladder: first stir the good inclination against the evil (*rigzu*); if unsuccessful, study Torah (*imru bilvavkhem*—interpreted as "speak words [of Torah] in your heart"); if still unsuccessful, recite the Shema (*al mishkavkhem*—"upon your bed"); and finally pray (*vedommu*—understood as the silent Amidah).

This liturgical appropriation transforms the psalm's instruction to adversaries into a spiritual discipline for the pious. Where the *pshat* directs enemies to nighttime moral reckoning, the Talmud and later liturgy redirect the verse toward the bedtime prayers (*Kriat Shema al ha-Mitah*) of the faithful. The evening contemplation the psalm describes has become prescription, the testimonial moment of trust ritualized as communal practice.
