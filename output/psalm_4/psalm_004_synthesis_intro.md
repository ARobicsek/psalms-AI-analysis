# Introduction to Psalm 4

Psalm 4 is an evening prayer, a fact declared explicitly in its liturgical performance instruction (*lamnatzēaḥ binginōt*, למנצח בנגינות) and confirmed by its climactic image: a human being lying down to sleep in profound security (v. 9). The psalm's genius lies in how it deploys this quotidian act—the simple, vulnerable moment of closing one's eyes at night—as the ultimate test and proof of covenantal trust. Against unnamed opponents who seek prosperity through illusions and frauds (v. 3), the psalmist demonstrates that genuine peace (*šālôm*) derives not from material abundance but from divine faithfulness and present attentiveness. The psalm's rhetorical progression—from urgent petition (v. 2), through instruction directed at adversaries (vv. 3-6), to a climactic testimony of contentment (vv. 7-9)—positions the speaker as both supplicant and sage, whose capacity to "lie down and sleep" validates a theology of trust over anxious materialism.

The opening petition introduces a distinctive divine epithet that signals the psalm's theological core: *'ĕlōhê ṣidqî* (אלהי צדקי), translated variously as "God of my righteousness," "my righteous God," or "God my vindicator." The ambiguity is generative. BDB lexicon notes that *ṣedeq* (צדק) signifies both ethical righteousness and forensic vindication—"rightness, justness" as well as "righteousness as vindicated." The psalmist invokes this deity precisely because past experience proves divine responsiveness: "in distress you enlarged me" (*baṣṣār hirḥabtā lî*, בצר הרחבת לי). This spatial metaphor, attested across biblical Hebrew (compare Job 36:16's similar imagery), transforms the physical sensation of constriction—whether siege, childbirth, or legal confinement—into a theological category. God is the one who creates breathing room when circumstances compress. The metaphor's opposite appears in verse 3, where opponents turn the psalmist's *kābôd* (כבוד, glory/honor) into *liklimmâ* (לכלמה, shame), suggesting a world of zero-sum social capital where one's elevation requires another's degradation.

Who are these adversaries? Traditional commentators identified them with Absalom's supporters during David's flight (so Radak), while Ibn Ezra emphasized their class status: *bənê 'îš* (בני איש) denotes not generic humanity but "men of rank," the social elite. The concordance reveals this phrase appears 120 times across Scripture, often denoting persons of status (compare 1 Samuel 26:15, "Are you not a man [*'îš*]?"). What the psalmist contests is not merely personal antipathy but a rival vision of security itself. The opponents "love emptiness" (*rîq*, ריק) and "seek falsehood" (*kāzāb*, כזב)—terms the figurative language database identifies as metonymies where abstract qualities stand for concrete objects or practices. They pursue *šāw'* (שוא), "illusion," a term that in contexts like Exodus 20:7 denotes taking God's name "in vain." Their security depends on what the psalm calls, in stark agricultural imagery, "*dəgānām wətîrôšām rābû*" (דגנם ותירושם רבו, "their grain and wine have multiplied," v. 8). This merism—grain and wine standing for comprehensive material prosperity—echoes Deuteronomic covenant blessings (Deuteronomy 7:13; 11:14). The opponents' joy is tied to harvest success.

Against this, the psalmist makes an audacious epistemological claim in verse 4: "*wəd'û kî-hiflâ YHWH ḥāsîd lô*" (ודעו כי הפלה ה׳ חסיד לו, "Know that the LORD has set apart the faithful for himself"). The verb *hiflâ* (הפלה) carries multiple semantic layers. BDB lexicon notes it can mean "separate, distinguish" (as in Exodus 9:4), "make wonderful" (related to *pele'*, miracle), or "set apart" in an election sense. All three readings converge here: God's distinguishing act *is* miraculous, and it establishes the *ḥāsîd* (חסיד, faithful one) in a special relationship. Ibn Ezra emphasizes that God "made known who His faithful one is" through responsive hearing. The term *ḥāsîd* appears 32 times across Psalms, predominantly in late compositions, suggesting a developed piety category associated with Second Temple devotion. Meiri identifies it with one "who practices lovingkindness beyond the strict requirement of the law," linking divine *ḥesed* (steadfast love) to human ethical behavior.

This leads to the psalm's most unusual passage, verses 5-6, a cascade of five imperatives directed at the opponents: "*rigzû wə'al-teḥeṭā'û 'imrû bilbabkem 'al-miškabkem wədommû*" (רגזו ואל תחטאו אמרו בלבבכם על משכבכם ודמו, "Tremble and do not sin; speak in your hearts upon your beds and be silent"). The verb *rigzû* (רגזו) has provoked extensive debate. BDB lexicon lists multiple possibilities: "tremble" (in fear or awe), "be angry," or "be agitated/perturbed." Rashi opts for religious awe: "tremble before the Holy One." Ibn Ezra prefers "fear because the king notices mockery directed at him." The Septuagint renders *orgizesthe* (be angry), which Paul quotes in Ephesians 4:26 ("Be angry but do not sin"), establishing this verse in Christian tradition as legitimizing righteous anger. But the context suggests existential trembling rather than moral indignation. The psalmist instructs opponents to conduct nocturnal introspection—speaking "in your hearts" (*bilbabkem*, בלבבכם) while "upon your beds" (*'al-miškabkem*, על משכבכם). The bed becomes a site of vulnerable moral reckoning, where the protective distractions of daylight activity cease.

Verse 6's command to "sacrifice sacrifices of righteousness" (*zibḥû zibḥê-ṣedeq*, זבחו זבחי צדק) employs a cognate accusative construction that intensifies the noun through the verb. But what are "sacrifices of righteousness"? Radak sees them as offerings accompanied by genuine repentance, distinguishing them from "sacrifices of the wicked" (Proverbs 21:27), which follow hollow ritual with continued wickedness. Ibn Ezra identifies them with *šəlāmîm* (peace offerings), whose portions go to the altar "not on account of sin offerings or burnt offerings" but as pure thanksgiving. The prophetic critique of sacrificial abuse (see Isaiah 1:11; Micah 6:6-8) resonates here—the psalm demands ethical transformation, not mechanical ritual. Malbim's reading is particularly striking: he understands *zibḥê-ṣedeq* as thanksgiving offerings brought specifically because the psalmist's righteousness has been publicly vindicated (he places the psalm during the famine in David's reign, resolved when God confirmed it was "for Saul and his bloody house" [2 Samuel 21:1], not David's sin). On this reading, the *ṣedeq* root appears in verses 2 and 6 as an inclusio, bracketing the psalm's argument: the "God of my righteousness/vindication" calls for "sacrifices of righteousness/vindication."

The psalm's central contrast crystallizes in verses 7-8. Many say, "*mî yar'ēnû ṭôb*" (מי יראנו טוב, "Who will show us good?"). This is the voice of epistemological despair, the cry of those who see no evidence of divine favor in their circumstances. The psalmist responds not by argument but by testimony: "*nəsâ-'ālênû 'ôr pānêkā YHWH*" (נסה עלינו אור פניך ה׳, "Lift upon us the light of your face, O LORD"). The phrase unmistakably echoes the Aaronic benediction of Numbers 6:25: "*yā'ēr YHWH pānāw 'ēlêkā*" (יאר ה׳ פניו אליך, "May the LORD make his face shine upon you"). The concordance shows this "light of face" imagery appears only four times in Psalms (4:7; 44:4; 89:16; and Proverbs 16:15), always denoting divine favor and blessing. But the psalmist's experience is "*nātattâ śimḥâ bəlibbî mē'ēt dəgānām wətîrôšām rābû*" (נתתה שמחה בלבי מעת דגנם ותירושם רבו, "You put joy in my heart more than when their grain and wine multiplied," v. 8). The temporal/comparative *mē'ēt* (מעת) is syntactically ambiguous—does it mean "from the time when" or "more than"? Most commentators prefer "more than," establishing a clear value contrast: divine joy exceeds material prosperity. Even when the opponents' harvests succeed, the psalmist's contentment surpasses theirs because its source is covenantal relationship, not agricultural fortune.

This contrast sets up the psalm's climactic testimony: "*bəšālôm yaḥdāw 'eškəbâ wə'îšān kî-'attâ YHWH ləbādād lābeṭaḥ tôšîbēnî*" (בשלום יחדו אשכבה ואישן כי אתה ה׳ לבדד לבטח תושיבני, v. 9). Three terms for rest appear: lying down (*'eškəbâ*), sleeping (*'îšān*), and dwelling securely (*lābeṭaḥ tôšîbēnî*). The psalmist performs trust through vulnerability—sleep is the ultimate relinquishment of control. The evening setting reverses the opponents' daytime pursuits; while they chase grain and wine, the faithful can release consciousness itself into divine care. The syntactic ambiguity of *ləbādād* (לבדד, "alone/solitary") has generated debate: does it modify "You LORD alone" (monotheistic emphasis) or "me dwelling alone" (solitary security)? Ibn Ezra notes both readings are grammatically possible, and the ambiguity may be deliberate—the psalmist dwells alone *because* YHWH alone provides security. The term echoes Deuteronomy 33:28's description of Israel dwelling "*beṭaḥ bādād*" (בטח בדד, "secure, alone") in a land of grain and wine. But whereas Deuteronomy's blessing depends on agricultural abundance, Psalm 4 locates security in God's presence independent of harvest success.

This theology of contentment grounded in covenantal trust rather than material abundance explains the psalm's remarkable liturgical history. In Edot HaMizrach traditions, Psalm 4 appears in the Yom Kippur Maariv service, introduced along with Psalms 1-3 and 24 before Aleinu. The placement is profound: on the Day of Atonement, after a full day of fasting and confession, worshippers recite this psalm as they prepare for the Neilah service and the eventual breaking of the fast. The psalm's message—that true security comes not from material satiation but from God's responsiveness—resonates precisely when the community has voluntarily renounced food and drink. Additionally, verse 5 ("*rigzû wə'al-teḥeṭā'û 'imrû bilbabkem 'al-miškabkem wədommû*") appears daily in the *Kriat Shema al HaMitah* (Bedtime Shema) across both Ashkenazic and Sefardic traditions. This home-based devotional practice embeds the psalmist's evening introspection into the quotidian rhythm of Jewish spiritual life, making the psalm's climactic testimony—lying down to sleep in trust—a lived daily discipline rather than an aspirational ideal.

The psalm's canonical achievement lies in its transformation of ordinary human experience into theological argument. By presenting sleep itself as evidence of trust's validity, Psalm 4 democratizes piety beyond priestly sacrifice or prophetic vision. Any person, any night, can test whether covenantal relationship provides genuine security by the simple act of closing their eyes in peace. The opponents' pursuit of prosperity through illusion is exposed not by prophetic denunciation but by the quiet testimony of restful sleep—a subversive claim that the most compelling proof of God's care happens not in dramatic theophany but in the vulnerable, quotidian moment when consciousness yields to darkness, trusting that morning will come.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

Psalm 4 occupies a distinctive niche in Jewish liturgical tradition, appearing primarily in contexts that emphasize evening prayer, introspection, and divine protection during vulnerability. In Edot HaMizrach (Sephardic/Mizrahi) liturgy, the psalm appears in its entirety as part of the Yom Kippur Maariv service, recited alongside Psalms 1, 2, 3, and 24 as devotional preludes before Aleinu and the concluding Kaddish Shalem. This placement underscores the psalm's theology of trust during affliction—appropriate for a day devoted to penitence and divine mercy.

More widespread is the liturgical use of verse 5: "*rigzû wə'al-teḥeṭā'û 'imrû bilbabkem 'al-miškabkem wədommû selāh*" (רגזו ואל תחטאו אמרו בלבבכם על משכבכם ודמו סלה, "Tremble and do not sin; speak in your hearts upon your beds and be silent, Selah"). This verse appears in the *Kriat Shema al HaMitah* (Bedtime Recitation of the Shema) across both Ashkenazic and Sefardic traditions, where it functions as a call to evening self-examination before sleep. The liturgy instructs that it be recited three times, embedding the psalmist's introspective discipline into daily practice. This domestic recitation transforms the psalm's climactic image—lying down to sleep in divine security—from theological claim into lived spiritual discipline, making Psalm 4's evening testimony a quotidian experience rather than an aspirational ideal.

Individual phrases from the psalm also appear in penitential contexts. The petition "*bəqārə'î 'ănēnî*" (בקראי עננני, "when I call, answer me," v. 2) is incorporated into Yom Kippur Katan Selichot and Yom Kippur Shacharit piyyutim in Edot HaMizrach, emphasizing the psalmist's confidence in divine responsiveness during moments of spiritual urgency. The phrase "*nəsâ-'ālênû 'ôr pānêkā YHWH*" (נסה עלינו אור פניך ה׳, "Lift upon us the light of Your countenance," v. 7) appears in Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur liturgy within the Amidah's reader's repetition, positioned as a supplication for divine favor and illumination during the Days of Awe. This liturgical placement suggests that Jewish tradition understands Psalm 4 not merely as a personal prayer for evening security but as a communal petition for divine presence during seasons of judgment and vulnerability.
