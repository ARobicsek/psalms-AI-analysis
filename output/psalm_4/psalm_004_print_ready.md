# Commentary on Psalm 4
---
## Introduction
Psalm 4 is an evening psalm—yet not because it whispers. Its voice is steady, direct, even instructional. The speaker calls for an answer (v. 2), turns and rebukes “sons of man” (v. 3), issues commands (vv. 5–6), then returns to quiet joy and untroubled sleep (v. 9). If lament normally devotes itself to complaint about enemies before God, this poet faces the adversaries squarely and teaches. The theological claim that emerges is simple enough to memorize and difficult to live: the good that truly secures a life is not the visible increase of “grain and wine” but the inward gift of joy that God places in the heart (v. 8). The bed, at day’s end, is where that lesson can be learned.
Two patterns frame the psalm. First, an inclusio—that is, a framing repetition—encloses the opening plea with the assurance of hearing. “Answer me when I call… hear my prayer” (v. 2) is answered within the psalm itself: “YHWH hears when I call to Him” (v. 4). Second, the evening frame: the admonition to ponder “on your bed” (v. 5) is answered by “In peace I lie down and sleep” (v. 9). The logic is not mystical but practical: quiet self-scrutiny leads to quiet rest.
A distinctive divine epithet begins the prayer: אֱלֹקֵי צִדְקִי, “God of my righteousness/vindication” (v. 2). The term צֶדֶק (tzedek) is not mere moralism; it is forensic—rightness in a contested case (BDB s.v.). To invoke “the God of my vindication” is to place one’s cause before the Judge who can restore honor publicly. The psalm immediately reaches for a physical metaphor to describe deliverance: “In the straits (בַּצָּר) You made wide for me (הִרְחַבְתָּ לִּי).” This is not a metaphor invented here. The move from constriction to “broad place” is a well-loved biblical way of naming rescue: “From distress I called on Yah; Yah answered me with freedom” (מִן־הַמֵּצַר… בַמֶּרְחָב, Ps 118:5); “He brought me out to a broad place” (Ps 18:20); “Bring me out of my straits” (Ps 25:17). Pressed and hemmed in—then room to breathe.
The poem pivots abruptly: “Sons of man (בְּנֵי אִישׁ), how long will my glory be [turned] to shame?” (v. 3). The phrase בְּנֵי אִישׁ typically marks elites, not the general populace (compare Ps 49:3; 62:10). The conflict is described in the honor-shame idiom of the ancient Mediterranean: כָּבוֹד (kavod, “glory,” a person’s social weight) is being treated as כְּלִמָּה (kelimah, “ignominy”). The charge is threefold: they love רִיק (riq, “emptiness, illusion”), they seek כָזָב (kazav, “falsehood”), and they aim to reverse the psalmist’s honor. The vocabulary has theological teeth. Elsewhere רִיק and its cousins (הֶבֶל, “vapor, non-gods,” Deut 32:21) and כָזָב (“lie,” often for false prophecy, Ezek 13:8–9) signal idolatrous trust in “nothings.” The structure is sapiential: the speaker contrasts two ways of seeking the good.
What follows is instruction rather than diatribe. “Know (וּדְעוּ)—and in biblical Hebrew ‘know’ conveys recognition leading to action—that YHWH has הִפְלָה (hiflah) the faithful one for Himself” (v. 4). The verb, hiphil of פָּלָא, is used for “setting apart, distinguishing” (Exod 9:4; 11:7), and carries a sense of God’s wondrous differentiating action. The medievals press the same point from different angles: Rashi glosses simply “has separated”; Ibn Ezra, “distinguished and made known”; Radak takes it as royal election—God separated David “from all Israel to be king.” The noun חָסִיד (chasid) names the “faithful”—not the sentimental “pious,” but one who practices covenant loyalty (חֶסֶד). That public setting-apart answers the honor crisis; it also underwrites the bold line that follows: “YHWH hears when I call to Him.”
Then the nocturne: “רִגְזוּ (rigzu) and do not sin; speak in your hearts on your beds, and be silent” (v. 5). What does רִגְזוּ mean? The root can mean tremble, quake, be agitated, even rage. The ancient Greek translation (the Septuagint, “LXX”) chose “be angry,” and the Apostle Paul famously cited it that way (Ephesians 4:26). Jewish tradition tended to hear “tremble [before God],” with Rashi and Radak drawing the sense toward reverent fear. The Talmud both preserves and repurposes the line. In one strand it regulates bedtime piety—recite Shema on your bed and be silent (Berakhot 4b–5a). In another, it turns the verb into a psychological practice: “A person should always incite (יַרְגִּיז) the good inclination against the evil inclination” (Berakhot 5a). Either way, the sequence is crucial: disturbance (emotional or moral), then restraint (“and do not sin”), then inward speech in the night hours, then quiet. Evening exposes our inner weather; the psalm tells us what to do with it.
The next imperative is cultic and moral in a single phrase: “Offer sacrifices of righteousness (זִבְחֵי־צֶדֶק), and trust in YHWH” (v. 6). The genitive can bear more than one shade: sacrifices rightly offered; sacrifices that flow from repentance; sacrifices God actually desires (compare Ps 51:21: “Then You will desire sacrifices of righteousness…”; Deut 33:19). Radak ties it to genuine repentance; Rashi spiritualizes: “Make your deeds righteous, and it will be as if you offer sacrifices.” The point is doubled: external rite and inward trust go together—or else the rite is hollow.
Who are the “many” of v. 7? “Many are saying, ‘Who will show us good?’ Lift up the light of Your face upon us, YHWH.” The phrase plays two ways at once. On the one hand, it quotes faithful liturgy: “the light of Your face” is the heart of the priestly blessing (Num 6:25), and psalms use it for concrete divine favor (Ps 44:4; 89:16). On the other hand, the question “Who will show us good?” can turn anxious or cynical, especially when the “good” is measured by harvests and vintage. The psalm does not sneer at that desire; Torah itself promises “grain and wine” to the obedient (Deut 7:13). But it does contrast two reckonings of blessing.
“You have put joy in my heart—more than when their grain and their new wine increased” (v. 8). The small preposition מֵעֵת (me’et) is the hinge. It can read temporally (“at the time when”), comparatively (“more than when”), or even causally in sense (“because”). The medievals already take sides: Radak hears the temporal—“I rejoiced at their prosperity, even while they rejoice at my ill”—an achievement of magnanimity. Metzudat David prefers the comparative: an inward gift surpasses outward plenty. Ibn Ezra, subtle as always, hears God giving a “good heart” that genuinely desires the good of all. Each reading carries moral weight, but the contrastive sense fits the psalm’s architecture: the “many” seek visible increase; the speaker testifies to a deeper sufficiency, a joy not hostage to circumstance.
The closing verse returns to the bed and then beyond it. “In peace, יַחְדָּו (yachdav), I lie down and sleep, for You, YHWH, לְבָדָד (levadad), make me dwell secure” (v. 9). Both adverbs deserve a moment. יַחְדָּו can mean “together” (with others) or “at once.” In this context the temporal force is persuasive: lying down and sleeping come “in one motion,” an immediacy denied to the anxious (so the medieval Metzudat David). לְבָדָד plainly modifies the subject (“You, YHWH, alone”), though its echo of Deuteronomy 33:28 (“Israel dwells secure, alone… in a land of grain and wine”) does more work: God’s sufficiency is not a bare monotheism; it is monergism—the claim that security is God’s doing, not God plus affluence, allies, or self-care. That is why the psalmist can teach the enemies (vv. 3–6) without fear and can sleep (v. 9) without delay. The bed is the right school for such a claim. Night strips away visible supports. If a joy “given in the heart” still hums after the lights are out, it is real.
A few guideposts for readers. “Inclusio” names the framing repetition that brackets a unit; “colon” here means a poetic line in a parallel pair; “LXX” refers to the Septuagint, an ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, often useful for hearing how early readers understood a line. Those labels matter much less than the psalm’s simple invitation: let the day still enough for honest thought, offer what you have to God, and trust. The sleep that follows is the theology.

#### Full psalm
In several traditions, Psalm 4 is an evening psalm for the holiest night of the year. In the Edot HaMizrach (Eastern) rite, it is recited in full at Yom Kippur Maariv as part of the introductory psalms that set a penitential tone: “בְּקׇרְאִי עֲנֵנִי אֱלֹקֵי צִדְקִי” (“Answer me when I call, O God of my vindication,” Ps 4:2) resonates with the day’s plea for mercy. Some Ashkenazic machzorim likewise include Psalm 4 among the prefaces to the Kol Nidrei service.
#### Key verses
Psalm 4:2. בְּקׇרְאִי עֲנֵנִי אֱלֹקֵי צִדְקִי (“When I call, answer me, O God of my vindication”). In the High Holiday prayers (Edot HaMizrach), this line is woven into the Seder HaAvodah of Yom Kippur Mussaf: “בְּקָרְאִי עֲנֵנִי אֱלֹקֵי צִדְקִי” appears in poetic petitions that model the congregation’s cry for a favorable judgment. Similarly, Selichot and Yom Kippur Katan piyyutim echo this verse to frame the community’s plea: “בְּקָרְאֵנוּ עֲנֵנוּ אֱלֹקֵי יִשְׁעֵנוּ… חָנֵּנוּ וּשְׁמַע תְּפִלָּתֵנוּ” (“When we call, answer us, O God of our salvation… be gracious and hear our prayer”).
Psalm 4:4. ה׳ יִשְׁמַע בְּקׇרְאִי אֵלָיו (“YHWH will hear when I call to Him”). In the Yom Kippur evening Selichot (Edot HaMizrach), this assurance is quoted amid verses of divine compassion, giving doctrinal spine to the night’s confessions: the God who distinguishes His faithful (חָסִיד) hears.
Psalm 4:5. רִגְזוּ וְאַל תֶּחֱטָאוּ… עַל־מִשְׁכַּבְכֶם וְדֹמּוּ (“Tremble and do not sin… on your beds, be silent”). This is the cornerstone of Kriat Shema al ha-Mitah, the bedtime Shema. The liturgy instructs: “רִגְזוּ וְאַל תֶּחֱטָאוּ אִמְרוּ בִלְבַבְכֶם עַל־מִשְׁכַּבְכֶם וְדֹמּוּ סֶלָה” (recited thrice), directing worshipers to reflect and quiet themselves before sleep. The Talmud (Berakhot 4b–5a) cites the verse to require Shema at bedtime and to map a spiritual sequence: provoke the good impulse, study Torah, recite Shema, then pray—an interpretive ladder derived from the verse’s order.
#### Phrases
Psalm 4:7. נְּסָה־עָלֵינוּ אוֹר פָּנֶיךָ ה׳ (“Lift upon us the light of Your face, O YHWH”). In High Holiday piyyutim (Edot HaMizrach), this phrase is inserted as a petition for divine favor during judgment: “נְּסָה־עָלֵינוּ אוֹר פָּנֶיךָ ה׳,” echoing the priestly blessing (Numbers 6:25). Liturgically, the line tilts the psalm’s contrast toward the true “good”: God’s face rather than produce.
The liturgical uses both confirm the psalm’s plain sense (nighttime reflection; trust that God hears) and carry it further. Bedtime practice turns v. 5 from a rebuke to opponents into a discipline for the faithful; the High Holiday insertions underscore the psalm’s courtroom language—“God of my vindication”—within communal confession.

## Verse-by-Verse Commentary
**Verse 1**
לַמְנַצֵּ֥חַ בִּנְגִינ֗וֹת מִזְמ֥וֹר לְדָוִֽד׃
The superscription—“לַמְנַצֵּחַ בִּנְגִּינוֹת מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד”—locates the psalm in Israel’s professional liturgy. לַמְנַצֵּחַ (“for the director/leader”) appears across 55 psalm headings; it most naturally denotes the temple official who oversaw musical performance (1 Chr 15:21). בִּנְגִּינוֹת singles out stringed accompaniment (from נְגִינָה), a category the headings deploy sparingly (Ps 4; 6; 54; 55; 67; 76; Hab 3:19). The Davidic tag can function as royal setting (Radak links it to the Absalom episode), but the superscription is primarily liturgical guidance: this prayer was meant to be led, sung, and heard. The notice “with stringed instruments” does more than furnish a soundtrack. Psalm 4 is saturated with evening quiet—“on your beds” (v. 5), “I lie down and sleep” (v. 9). A plucked timbre suits a text that moves from agitation to silence. The form, too, aligns with performance: the pauses marked by סֶלָה (“Selah,” vv. 3, 5) are likely musical interludes—rests in which the congregation listens as the instruments sustain the thought.
It is worth naming how a biblical heading functions. These short docket lines are later editorial markers that bound psalms into collections (e.g., “for the director,” “of David,” “of Asaph”). They indicate manner (“with flutes” in Ps 5) or festival (“for the dedication of the house” in Ps 30). Here, “for the leader… with strings” casts this piece not as a private whisper but as a public instruction. That helps make sense of what follows: a prayer that becomes a rebuke to nobles, then a series of imperatives, then a testimony. This is practical theology for the evening hour, taught with a lyre in hand.
**Verse 2**
בְּקׇרְאִ֡י עֲנֵ֤נִי ׀ אֱלֹ֘קֵ֤י צִדְקִ֗י בַּ֭צָּר הִרְחַ֣בְתָּ לִּ֑י חׇ֝נֵּ֗נִי וּשְׁמַ֥ע תְּפִלָּתִֽי׃
“בְּקׇרְאִי עֲנֵנִי אֱלֹקֵי צִדְקִי… בַּצָּר הִרְחַבְתָּ לִּי; חׇנֵּנִי וּשְׁמַע תְּפִלָּתִי.” Three imperatives—“answer… be gracious… hear”—press the plea. The epithet אֱלֹקֵי צִדְקִי (“God of my righteousness/vindication”) is unique in the Psalter and legal in tone: צֶדֶק here points to rightness in dispute (BDB s.v.). The psalm is a lawsuit of sorts, and God is the judge who can publicly restore the speaker’s honor. The perfect verb “הִרְחַבְתָּ לִּי” (“You made wide for me”) inserts a past deliverance into the present request. The spatial idiom is a stock biblical metaphor for rescue: “From the narrow place I called; Yah answered me with freedom” (Ps 118:5), “He brought me out to the broad place” (Ps 18:20). The pair בַּצָּר (“in distress, in straits”) and מֶרְחָב (“broad space”) give us something tactile: distress is constriction; salvation is room to turn around.
The line also sketches the psalm’s logic of confidence. Petition is grounded in memory: “You did this before; do it again.” The sequence “answer… be gracious… hear” progresses from outcome (answer) to attitude (grace) to process (hearing). It rehearses not only what the psalmist wants but who God is. In liturgical use this line often becomes the congregation’s own first cry (see Yom Kippur citations above), which makes sense of the unusual epithet. On a night of judgment, “God of my vindication” is the name faith needs.
**Verse 3**
בְּנֵ֥י אִ֡ישׁ עַד־מֶ֬ה כְבוֹדִ֣י לִ֭כְלִמָּה תֶּאֱהָב֣וּן רִ֑יק תְּבַקְשׁ֖וּ כָזָ֣ב סֶֽלָה׃
“בְּנֵי אִישׁ, עַד־מֶה כְבוֹדִי לִכְלִמָּה? תֶּאֱהָבוּן רִיק; תְּבַקְשׁוּ כָזָב.” The addressee shifts from God to “sons of man,” a phrase that, in contrast to בְּנֵי אָדָם (“mortals”), commonly marks people of rank (Ps 49:3; 62:10). The rhetorical “How long?” (עַד־מֶה) normally interrogates God (e.g., Ps 13:2), but here it indicts nobles complicit in honor reversal: the speaker’s כָּבוֹד (“glory,” social weight) is being treated as כְּלִמָּה (“shame, disgrace”). The crimes named—love of רִיק (“emptiness, illusion”) and pursuit of כָזָב (“lie, fraud”)—are not mere insults. In biblical usage these terms often carry idolatrous overtones. Deuteronomy 32:21 castigates Israel for provoking God “with no-gods (בְּלֹא־אֵל),” and the prophets use הֶבֶל/רִיק for “nothings” that cannot save; Ezekiel 13 attacks “lying divinations” (כָּזָב) in God’s name. Our line compresses a moral world: courting unsubstantial goods and building one’s case on deception will, in time, invert honor and shame.
The verse ends with סֶלָה (Selah), an interpretive and performative pause. In recitation this is where the instruments might carry the rebuke forward, letting the accusations ring. The effect is theatrical: the prayer addresses adversaries directly, seizing the initiative. That move makes the next line—“Know that YHWH has set apart the faithful”—not a private consolation but a public correction. The psalm is not content to plead a case; it teaches one.
**Verse 4**
וּדְע֗וּ כִּֽי־הִפְלָ֣ה ה׳ חָסִ֣יד ל֑וֹ ה׳ יִ֝שְׁמַ֗ע בְּקׇרְאִ֥י אֵלָֽיו׃
“וּדְעוּ כִּי־הִפְלָה ה׳ חָסִיד לוֹ; ה׳ יִשְׁמַע בְּקׇרְאִי אֵלָיו.” The imperative “know” (וּדְעוּ) calls for recognition that changes conduct. The verb הִפְלָה (hiphil of פָּלָא) here means “has distinguished, set apart” (Exod 9:4; 11:7), and often shades into the marvelous: God’s separating action is wondrous. The object is “חָסִיד,” the faithful one—one who practices covenant loyalty (חֶסֶד). Medieval readers vary the emphasis: Rashi reads “has separated”; Ibn Ezra “distinguished and made known”; Radak extends it to royal election—God “has separated me… to be king,” echoing Deut 10:8 on Levi. In any case, divine election renders the nobles’ calculus of honor and shame irrelevant.
The second cola form an inclusio with v. 2: “YHWH hears when I call” answers “Answer me when I call.” Note the verb change: the plea for “answer” yields the confidence of “hear.” In Hebrew poetics the two cola are not mere synonyms but a small progression: the first asserts a theological fact (set apart), the second draws its practical consequence (He hears when I call). This is a textbook example of parallelism as “A is so, and what’s more, B.”
**Verse 5**
רִגְז֗וּ וְֽאַל־תֶּ֫חֱטָ֥אוּ אִמְר֣וּ בִ֭לְבַבְכֶם עַֽל־מִשְׁכַּבְכֶ֗ם וְדֹ֣מּוּ סֶֽלָה׃
“רִגְזוּ וְאַל־תֶּחֱטָאוּ; אִמְרוּ בִלְבַבְכֶם עַל־מִשְׁכַּבְכֶם וְדֹמּוּ סֶלָה.” The command sequence unfurls like a spiritual practice. First disturbance—“רִגְזוּ.” The verb can mean tremble, quake, be agitated, even rage. The Septuagint rendered “be angry,” which Paul cites in Ephesians 4:26 (“Be angry and do not sin”). Jewish readers most often hear reverent fear: Rashi, “tremble before the Holy One”; Radak, “fear God if you do not fear me.” The Babylonian Talmud (Berakhot 5a) preserves both layers. One teaching says, “Let the good impulse incite (יַרְגִּיז) the evil impulse”; if that fails, study Torah; if that fails, recite Shema; if that fails, remember the day of death—an ascetic ladder that builds directly on our verse’s steps. Another derives the halakhic practice of Kriat Shema al ha-Mitah (Shema at bedtime) from “on your beds.” Either way, the verse sketches an evening itinerary: acknowledge your agitation; refuse sin; let your internal speech take place in the off-hours; then stop speaking. The silence (דֹמּוּ) to which it leads is not passivity but poise. The Selah invites a musical hush.
The phrase “speak in your heart” (אִמְרוּ בִלְבַבְכֶם) is a standard biblical idiom for inner discourse (cf. Isa 47:8). Its coupling with “on your beds” makes the psalm’s practical wisdom concrete. Daytime clamor muffles conscience; the night returns attention. On the psalm’s own terms, this interior work is the prelude to public worship (v. 6) and restful sleep (v. 9).
**Verse 6**
זִבְח֥וּ זִבְחֵי־צֶ֑דֶק וּ֝בִטְח֗וּ אֶל־ה׳׃
“זִבְחוּ זִבְחֵי־צֶדֶק; וּבִטְחוּ אֶל־ה׳.” The line pairs outer rite and inner stance. “Sacrifices of righteousness” can mean sacrifices rightly offered (i.e., not perfunctory or compromised), or sacrifices that flow from repentance, or, as Psalm 51:21 has it, the offerings God actually desires once inner repair is done. Deuteronomy 33:19 uses the same phrase in a positive cultic sense. Radak presses against “the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination” (Prov 21:27): such men revert to evil after offering. Rashi, characteristically brief, turns the altar inward: “Make your deeds righteous, and it will be as if you offer sacrifices.” Ibn Ezra identifies these as peace offerings (שְׁלָמִים), the communal feast of gratitude rather than the expiatory offerings of guilt or sin.
The second colon, “trust in YHWH,” is the counterweight. Sacrifice without trust becomes manipulation; trust without sacrifice risks pious abstraction. The preposition “אֶל־ה׳” (to/toward YHWH) is a nice touch. Trust is not a static property; it has a direction.
**Verse 7**
רַבִּ֥ים אֹמְרִים֮ מִֽי־יַרְאֵ֢נ֫וּ ט֥וֹב נְֽסָה־עָ֭לֵינוּ א֨וֹר פָּנֶ֬יךָ ה׳׃
“רַבִּים אֹמְרִים, מִי־יַרְאֵנוּ טוֹב; נְּסָה־עָלֵינוּ אוֹר פָּנֶיךָ ה׳.” The “many” may be the adversaries of v. 3, or a broader constituency wearied by lack: “Who will show us good?” The petition that follows—“Lift up the light of Your face”—quotes the priestly blessing (Num 6:25) and a frequent psalmic trope for favor (Ps 44:4; 89:16). The verb נְּסָה here is best taken as a spelling variant of “נשא” (to lift, raise), with samekh replacing shin (a known alternation): “raise upon us.” Rashi hears the same and glosses with Isa 62:10, “הָרִימוּ נֵס” (“lift up a banner”). The line thus places faithful liturgy into the mouths of the “many”—they ask for what Israel is taught to ask. The psalm’s counterpoint is not that the request is wrong but that the “good” is not exhausted by harvest statistics.
Liturgically, communities have taken the second half on its own as a plea for benevolent presence in seasons of judgment (Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur). That reception history fits the psalm’s movement. The next line will identify the “good” that *is* already given.
**Verse 8**
נָתַ֣תָּה שִׂמְחָ֣ה בְלִבִּ֑י מֵעֵ֬ת דְּגָנָ֖ם וְתִירוֹשָׁ֣ם רָֽבּוּ׃
“נָתַתָּה שִׂמְחָה בְלִבִּי, מֵעֵת דְּגָנָם וְתִירוֹשָׁם רָבּוּ.” The construction “מֵעֵת” is the crux. If temporal: “You put joy in my heart at the time when their grain and wine multiplied.” If comparative: “more than when their grain and wine multiplied.” If causal in sense: “You put joy in my heart because their grain and wine multiplied,” i.e., generosity freed from rivalry. Medieval readers already offered all three. Radak dramatizes the magnanimous reading—while “they rejoice at my evil,” I have rejoiced at their good. Metzudat David prefers the comparative—joy in my portion exceeds their feast. Ibn Ezra notes God’s gift of a “good heart” that genuinely desires the good of all.
Two small details sharpen the contrast. First, the possessive: “their grain and their new wine,” not “ours.” The psalmist is outside the circle of visible prospering. Second, the pairing דָּגָן וְתִירוֹשׁ (“grain and new wine”) is a covenant merism for total agricultural blessing (Deut 7:13; 11:14). To name it is not to sneer; it is to situate it. In the psalm’s moral arithmetic, to ask, “Who will show us good?” (v. 7), is good; to receive “joy in my heart” is better—because it is the “good” that does not vanish when the bins empty. That is why the sleep of v. 9 can follow, even if “their” increase is not “mine.”
**Verse 9**
בְּשָׁל֣וֹם יַחְדָּו֮ אֶשְׁכְּבָ֢ה וְאִ֫ישָׁ֥ן כִּֽי־אַתָּ֣ה ה׳ לְבָדָ֑ד לָ֝בֶ֗טַח תּוֹשִׁיבֵֽנִי׃ {פ}
“בְּשָׁלוֹם יַחְדָּו אֶשְׁכְּבָה וְאִישָׁן; כִּי־אַתָּה ה׳ לְבָדָד לָבֶטַח תּוֹשִׁיבֵנִי.” The adverb יַחְדָּו here carries temporal force—“at once,” lie down and sleep in one motion—over against the sleeplessness of anxiety (compare Ps 3:6: “I lay down and slept; I woke again, for YHWH sustained me”). Medieval readers who take “together” spatially (“with my people”) must supply a plural referent that the context does not provide. The phrase בְּשָׁלוֹם names not simply the absence of conflict but an all-around “wholeness” (shalom) that holds body, mind, and circumstance in quiet.
The theological center of gravity is לְבָדָד—“alone.” Grammatically it modifies “You, YHWH,” not the speaker. The claim is not isolation (“You make me dwell alone”) but sufficiency: You alone do this. The echo of Deuteronomy 33:28—“Israel dwells secure, alone (בָּדָד)… in a land of grain and wine”—gives the adverb flavor. There too, the point is not solitary existence but unthreatened dwelling under God’s own governance. Here the echo returns us to v. 8: whether or not “grain and wine” are presently mine, the security is God’s. The verb תּוֹשִׁיבֵנִי (“You make me dwell”) is causative (hiphil); the psalmist’s safety is not a mood but an enactment.
One can hear the psalm’s pedagogy come full circle. The nobles (v. 3) are rebuked and told to think (v. 5), to offer and to trust (v. 6). The “many” (v. 7) are given faithful words to say. The speaker testifies to a gift in the heart (v. 8) and an outcome in the body (v. 9). The music rests. The day is over.
