# Verse-by-Verse Commentary: Psalm 4

---

### Verse 1

**לַמְנַצֵּ֥חַ בִּנְגִינ֗וֹת מִזְמ֥וֹר לְדָוִֽד׃**

The superscription introduces this psalm with three distinct designations, each revealing aspects of its performance context and canonical placement. The term **לַמְנַצֵּחַ** (*lamnatzēaḥ*, "for the leader/conductor") appears in 55 psalm superscriptions, marking this as part of a curated liturgical collection. The root נצח suggests both victory and endurance, though here it most likely denotes the *menatzeach*, the chief musician responsible for temple worship (cf. 1 Chronicles 15:21). Rashi explains that David composed this psalm specifically "so that the Levites who conduct the melodies when singing on the platform should recite it" (שֶׁיֹּאמְרוּהוּ בְּנֵי לֵוִי הַמְנַצְּחִין בִּנְגִינוֹת בְּשִׁיר עַל הַדּוּכָן), grounding the text in concrete worship praxis.

The specification **בִּנְגִינ֗וֹת** (*binginot*, "with stringed instruments") is particularly noteworthy. The root נגן denotes the playing of stringed instruments, and this term appears in only seven psalm titles (Psalms 4, 6, 54, 55, 67, 76; Habakkuk 3:19). BDB lexicon notes that **נְגִינָה** can refer both to the music itself and to the instrumental accompaniment, suggesting that this psalm requires a specific musical setting distinct from wind instruments (חֲלִילִים) or percussion. The plural form may indicate multiple stringed instruments or varied melodic lines. Ibn Ezra offers multiple interpretations: some authorities understood it to mean the psalm had "two melodies" (שתי נעימות), while others took נגינות as the name for stringed instruments themselves. The Septuagint renders this neutrally as ἐν ψαλμοῖς ("with psalms"), showing how even ancient translators struggled with the technical specificity.

The Davidic attribution (**מִזְמ֥וֹר לְדָוִֽד**, *mizmor l'David*) links this evening prayer to the persona of David, whose life—particularly his flight from Absalom—provides the traditional context for many laments. The term **מִזְמוֹר** itself derives from the root זמר (to sing, make music), distinguishing it from **שִׁיר** (song) by emphasizing instrumental accompaniment. This superscription thus encodes a complete performance rubric: who performs it (the levitical conductor), how it is accompanied (stringed instruments), what type of composition it is (a mizmor), and whose voice it channels (David's). Modern liturgical practice preserves this technical vocabulary: Psalm 4 appears in the Yom Kippur Maariv service in Edot HaMizrach traditions, where it forms part of a devotional sequence alongside Psalms 1-3 and 24, creating an evening counterpoint to the day's penitential arc. The phrase **לַמְנַצֵּחַ בִּנְגִינוֹת מִזְמוֹר** also introduces Psalm 67 across multiple liturgical contexts—Kiddush Levanah, Simchat Torah hakafot, Hanukkah candle-lighting, and Sefirat HaOmer—demonstrating how superscriptions functioned as portable liturgical cues that traveled with their psalms into diverse prayer settings.

### Verse 2

**בְּקׇרְאִ֡י עֲנֵ֤נִי ׀ אֱלֹ֘הֵ֤י צִדְקִ֗י בַּ֭צָּר הִרְחַ֣בְתָּ לִּ֑י חׇ֝נֵּ֗נִי וּשְׁמַ֥ע תְּפִלָּתִֽי׃**

The opening petition employs a compressed, urgent syntax that mirrors its content—a cry for response in extremity. The temporal clause **בְּקׇרְאִ֡י עֲנֵ֤נִי** (*b'kor'i aneni*, "when I call, answer me") sets a conditional frame but deploys imperatives that collapse past deliverance into present plea. This is not merely "answer me when I call" but "in my very calling, be already answering"—the simultaneity of cry and response that characterizes covenantal relationship. The phrase appears verbatim in Psalm 3:5 (**קוֹלִי אֶל־יְהֹוָ֣ה אֶקְרָ֑א וַיַּעֲנֵ֨נִי**, "my voice—to YHWH I cried, and He answered me"), creating a verbal bridge between these adjacent psalms of distress. Jewish liturgy has seized on this petition: it appears in Yom Kippur Katan Selichot, Yom Kippur Shacharit piyyutim, and Ta'anit Esther services across traditions, always in contexts where the worshipper stands in dire need, declaring confidence that sincere prayer elicits divine response.

The divine epithet **אֱלֹ֘הֵ֤י צִדְקִ֗י** (*elohei tzidqi*) is grammatically ambiguous and theologically rich. Does it mean "God of my righteousness" (subjective genitive—God who establishes my righteousness), "my righteous God" (attributive—God characterized by righteousness), or "God my vindicator" (objective genitive—God who vindicates me)? BDB lexicon notes that צֶדֶק encompasses both "rightness, justness" and "righteousness as vindicated," suggesting all three readings converge. Radak opts for the forensic reading: "You know that with me is the right (עמי הצדק), and with him who is against me the wrong and the violence; and You, Lord, are Judge over us." The root צדק appears again in verse 6's **זִבְחֵי־צֶדֶק** (*zivchei-tzedeq*, "sacrifices of righteousness"), creating an inclusio that brackets the psalm's argument: the "God of my vindication" calls for "sacrifices of vindication." Ibn Ezra emphasizes causation: "You are the primary cause (הסבה הראשונה) for revealing my righteousness," making God not merely witness but active agent in the psalmist's exoneration.

The spatial metaphor **בַּ֭צָּר הִרְחַ֣בְתָּ לִּ֑י** (*ba-tzar hirchavta li*, "in [the] narrow-place You made-wide for me") transforms physical constriction into theological category. The root צרר denotes tightness, narrowness, distress—situations where options collapse and movement becomes impossible. Klein's dictionary connects this to siege warfare: "to confine in, narrow, compress; to lay siege to." The figurative language database shows this spatial imagery recurring across Scripture: Jacob uses it when he cries **וַיֵּ֫צֶר ל֑וֹ** (*vayetzer lo*, "and it was narrow for him," Genesis 32:8) in anticipation of meeting Esau; Job 36:16 describes God drawing one **מִפִּי־צָ֗ר רַ֭חַב** (*mipi-tzar rachav*, "from the mouth of narrowness to broad-place"). The antonym **הִרְחַבְתָּ** (from רחב, to make wide) suggests not merely relief but positive expansion—not just escape from siege but entry into a spacious land. The same imagery structures Israel's exodus narrative: brought out **מֵאֶ֥רֶץ צָרָ֖ה** (from a land of narrowness) into **אֶ֚רֶץ רְחָבָ֣ה** (a spacious land, Exodus 3:8). What makes this verse distinctive is its perfect tense: **הִרְחַ֣בְתָּ** is not petition but testimony—"You have made wide." The psalmist grounds his present plea (**חׇ֝נֵּ֗נִי וּשְׁמַ֥ע תְּפִלָּתִֽי**, "be gracious to me and hear my prayer") in past deliverance, creating the theological logic: because You widened me once, answer me now. This verse thus performs the psalm's central movement: from distress recalled to mercy petitioned, from narrow to wide, from past salvation to present hope.

### Verse 3

**בְּנֵ֥י אִ֡ישׁ עַד־מֶ֬ה כְבוֹדִ֣י לִ֭כְלִמָּה תֶּאֱהָב֣וּן רִ֑יק תְּבַקְשׁ֖וּ כָזָ֣ב סֶֽלָה׃**

The psalmist pivots sharply from petition to confrontation, directly addressing his opponents with a rhetoric that mixes exasperation and instruction. The phrase **בְּנֵ֥י אִ֡ישׁ** (*b'nei ish*) appears 120 times in Scripture, but its precise social reference remains contested. Rashi understands it as "the sons of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are called *ish*" (בְּנֵי אַבְרָהָם יִצְחָק וְיַעֲקֹב הַקְּרוּיִים אִישׁ), identifying the opponents as fellow Israelites of distinguished lineage. Ibn Ezra and Radak, however, read **בְּנֵי אִישׁ** as a technical term for social rank: "men of status" or "nobles" (הגדולים), contrasting with **בְּנֵי אָדָם** (the common people) as in Psalm 49:3 (**גַּם־בְּנֵ֣י אָ֭דָם גַּם־בְּנֵי־אִ֑ישׁ**, "both low and high"). The concordance shows this usage in 1 Samuel 26:15 (**הֲלוֹא־אִ֣ישׁ אַ֔תָּה וּמִ֥י כָמ֖וֹךָ בְּיִשְׂרָאֵֽל**, "Are you not a man [of distinction]?") and Judges 7:14 (Gideon as **אִ֥ישׁ יִשְׂרָאֵֽל**, "a great man of Israel"). This class reading sharpens the psalm's social conflict: David faces not rabble but the elites, those whose defection carries political weight.

The rhetorical question **עַד־מֶ֬ה** (*ad meh*, "how long?") is a standard lament formula (appearing in Psalms 13, 74, 79, 80, 82, 90, 94), but here it introduces not complaint against God but accusation against humans. The object of their attack is **כְבוֹדִ֣י** (*k'vodi*, "my glory/honor"), which they transform **לִ֭כְלִמָּה** (*likhlimah*, "into shame/disgrace"). The root כבד carries immense semantic freight: it denotes weight, heaviness, and thus importance, dignity, honor, glory. In royal contexts, it can refer to the monarch's majesty; in divine contexts, to God's glory-cloud. Radak explains this as the honor due to kingship: "I am king and you disgrace me and drive me from my kingdom" (שאני מלך ואתם מכלימים אותי ומבריחים אותי ממלכותי). But Rashi takes **כְבוֹדִי** as referring to David's person, citing the taunts from 1 Samuel: "Have you seen the son of Jesse?" (הראיתם את בן ישי, 1 Samuel 22:9), "Who is David and who is the son of Jesse?" (מי דוד ומי בן ישי, 1 Samuel 25:10). The opponents have turned David's identity—his royal dignity or perhaps even his divine election—into an object of public mockery.

The parallel accusation employs a threefold structure of culpable pursuit. They **תֶּאֱהָב֣וּן רִ֑יק** (*te'ahavun riq*, "love emptiness"), **תְּבַקְשׁ֖וּ כָזָ֣ב** (*t'vakshu khazav*, "seek falsehood"), prefaced by **עַד־מֶ֬ה**. The terms **רִיק** (emptiness, vanity) and **כָזָ֣ב** (lie, falsehood) form a hendiadys expressing the illusory nature of their enterprise. BDB notes that רִיק appears as a metonymy where an abstract quality (emptiness) stands for concrete objects or practices that are worthless. Ibn Ezra comments that they "love to speak empty and false words without ceasing" (תאהבון לדבר דברי ריק וכזב מבלי הפסק). Radak identifies the specific **רִיק** they love: "a thing that will not stand—namely, the kingdom of Absalom" (דבר שלא יתקים והוא מלכות אבשלום). The figurative language database reveals that "emptiness" appears 19 times across Scripture, often in contexts of futile human striving or idolatrous worship (Isaiah 41:29, Job 11:11). Here, the psalmist diagnoses his opponents' betrayal not merely as ethical failure but as existential delusion—they pursue what has no substance, love what cannot endure. The verse concludes with **סֶֽלָה** (selah), a liturgical pause marker that invites the community to contemplate this indictment before the psalm pivots to its response.

### Verse 4

**וּדְע֗וּ כִּֽי־הִפְלָ֣ה יְ֭הֹוָה חָסִ֣יד ל֑וֹ יְהֹוָ֥ה יִ֝שְׁמַ֗ע בְּקׇרְאִ֥י אֵלָֽיו׃**

The imperative **וּדְע֗וּ** (*u-d'u*, "and know!") marks a dramatic rhetorical shift from accusation to epistemological claim. The psalmist pivots from condemning his opponents' pursuit of emptiness to asserting a theological fact they must acknowledge. This imperative of knowing (from ידע, to know, perceive, understand) demands not abstract belief but recognition of demonstrated reality—what God has visibly done. The anaphoric structure—**יְהֹוָה** appears twice in close succession—creates emphasis through repetition, making God's name the axis around which the verse revolves.

The verb **הִפְלָ֣ה** (*hiflah*, "has set apart/distinguished/made wonderful") is semantically dense and theologically contested. BDB lexicon lists three primary meanings for the Hiphil stem of פלא: (1) "separate, distinguish" (as in Exodus 9:4, **וְהִפְלָה יְהוָה בֵּין מִקְנֵה יִשְׂרָאֵל**, "YHWH will distinguish between the cattle of Israel"); (2) "make wonderful, do wonders" (related to פֶּלֶא, wonder or miracle); (3) "treat differently, show partiality." All three senses resonate here. Rashi renders it simply: **הִבְדִּיל** (*hivdil*, "separated"), emphasizing election. Ibn Ezra integrates the senses: "He distinguished/separated (הבדיל) and made known (הודיע) who His faithful one (*chasido*) is, for He hears when he calls to Him"—the act of distinguishing is simultaneously epistemological (making known) and ontological (setting apart). Radak extends this to royal election: "He has separated me from all Israel to be king, on the analogy of 'YHWH separated the tribe of Levi' (Deuteronomy 10:8)." The choice of **הִפְלָ֣ה** thus encodes an entire election theology: God's separating act *is* miraculous, and it establishes the *chasid* in a unique relationship that opponents cannot annul.

The object of this divine action is **חָסִ֣יד ל֑וֹ** (*chasid lo*, "a faithful one for Himself"). The term **חָסִיד** appears 32 times in Psalms, predominantly in compositions dated to the Second Temple period, suggesting a developed category of piety associated with covenant loyalty and devotional practice. BDB notes the term can function actively (one who practices *chesed*, loving-kindness) or passively (one who receives *chesed*), though most favor the active sense: the *chasid* is one who embodies covenant faithfulness. Radak explains: "The *chasid* is one who does good to his fellow beyond the strict requirement of the law" (שעושה טובה עם חברו לפנים משורת הדין), citing David's treatment of Saul as exemplary—when Saul pursued him, David responded with mercy (1 Samuel 24:18-19). Meiri similarly defines *chasid* as one who practices lovingkindness "beyond what is legally required" (למעלה מן הדין). The Septuagint renders **חָסִ֣יד** as τὸν ὅσιον αὐτοῦ ("His holy one"), already interpreting the term through a lens of special sanctity rather than covenantal ethics. The phrase **חָסִ֣יד ל֑וֹ** ("for Himself") is crucial: this is not simply "a pious person" but one whom God has claimed, set apart, made His own. The preposition לוֹ marks possession and purpose—the *chasid* exists in relation to God's will and plan.

The verse concludes with a double assertion: **יְהֹוָ֥ה יִ֝שְׁמַ֗ע בְּקׇרְאִ֥י אֵלָֽיו׃** (*YHWH yishma b'kor'i elav*, "YHWH hears when I call to Him"). This echoes verse 2's opening petition (**בְּקׇרְאִ֡י עֲנֵ֤נִי**, "when I call, answer me"), creating an inclusio around verses 2-4. But whereas verse 2 was petition, verse 4 is confident declaration. The verb **יִשְׁמַע** (he will hear/does hear) can be read as either future or customary present—God's hearing is both assured promise and experienced reality. This verse thus transforms the psalmist's personal plea into universal principle: because God has set apart the faithful for Himself, He hears when they call. The logic moves from particular (my vindication) to universal (God's pattern of election) back to particular (therefore He hears *me*). The anaphoric **יְהֹוָה** that brackets the verse (appearing at both beginning and near-end) creates an envelope structure that makes God's name itself the container for the psalmist's confidence. This verse appears in Edot HaMizrach Shabbat Zachor liturgy as part of the piyyut "Mi Kamocha v'Ein Kamocha," attributed to Yehuda HaLevi, where it functions as theological anchor for meditation on Esther and Mordecai as exemplars of divine faithfulness—the psalm's declaration of God's care for the *chasid* becomes a lens through which to read Israel's hidden deliverance in the Purim narrative.

### Verse 5

**רִגְז֗וּ וְֽאַל־תֶּ֫חֱטָ֥אוּ אִמְר֣וּ בִ֭לְבַבְכֶם עַֽל־מִשְׁכַּבְכֶ֗ם וְדֹ֣מּוּ סֶֽלָה׃**

This verse presents a dense cascade of five imperatives, creating an instructional sequence that has generated extensive interpretive debate precisely because of the contested meaning of its opening verb. The term **רִגְז֗וּ** (*rigzu*, from the root רגז) has multiple possible senses, and the choice fundamentally alters the verse's rhetorical posture. BDB lexicon lists: (1) "tremble, quake" (in fear or awe), (2) "be angry, be enraged," (3) "be agitated, perturbed." Rashi opts for religious awe: **חִרְדוּ מִלִּפְנֵי הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא** (*chirdu milifnei ha-kadosh barukh hu*, "tremble before the Holy One, blessed be He"). Ibn Ezra reads it as fear prompted by divine accountability: "Tremble out of [fear of] HaShem... because the king takes note of the mockery directed at him" (כי המלך שואל הלעגות שלו). The Septuagint, however, renders **ὀργίζεσθε** ("be angry"), which Paul quotes in Ephesians 4:26 (**ὀργίζεσθε καὶ μὴ ἁμαρτάνετε**, "be angry but do not sin"), thus establishing the verse in Christian tradition as legitimating righteous anger. Radak synthesizes these readings by noting that רגז can mean fear (citing Deuteronomy 2:25, **וְרָגְז֖וּ וְחָל֥וּ**, "they will tremble and be in anguish"), arguing the context demands "fear God if you do not fear me."

The crucial interpretive issue is the logical relationship between **רִגְז֗וּ** and **וְֽאַל־תֶּ֫חֱטָ֥אוּ** (*v'al-techeta'u*, "and do not sin"). Does trembling prevent sin, or must anger be restrained lest it lead to sin? The syntax is purposefully ambiguous—the simple waw-conjunction can indicate sequence (tremble, then don't sin), purpose (tremble so that you don't sin), or contrast (though you tremble/are angry, don't sin). Malbim reads this as David's response to those who accused him regarding Bathsheba: "Tremble before God and do not sin by slandering David" (רגזו מה' ואל תחטאו להוציא דבה על דוד). On this reading, the opponents are those who spread false reports about David's guilt, and the command is to fear divine judgment for their slander. The verse thus becomes less about managing one's internal emotional state and more about ceasing a specific sin—the spreading of malicious gossip.

The sequence of three subsequent imperatives shifts from external posture to internal reflection. **אִמְר֣וּ בִ֭לְבַבְכֶם** (*imru vil'vavkhem*, "speak in your hearts") directs opponents to conduct interior dialogue. The phrase "speaking in the heart" is biblical idiom for thought or contemplation (cf. Genesis 17:17, **וַיֹּ֥אמֶר אַבְרָהָ֖ם בְּלִבּ֑וֹ**, "Abraham said in his heart"). Radak notes: "For a man upon his bed finds his heart freer from the concerns of the world (מעסקי העולם), and then will his intention be pure" (כונתו זכה). The temporal specification **עַֽל־מִשְׁכַּבְכֶ֗ם** (*al-mishkavkhem*, "upon your beds") situates this reflection in the evening—the psalm's liturgical setting becomes thematic content. Sleep is the paradigmatic moment of vulnerability, when defensive postures collapse and the day's deeds confront us. This verse appears in the Kriat Shema al HaMitah (Bedtime Shema) across both Ashkenazic and Sefardic traditions, where it functions as a protective meditation before sleep. The liturgy instructs that the verse be recited three times: **יאמר כל פסוק ג״פ: רִגְזוּ וְאַל תֶּחֱטָֽאוּ אִמְרוּ בִלְבַבְכֶם עַל מִשְׁכַּבְכֶם וְדֹֽמּוּ סֶֽלָה** ("each verse shall be recited three times: Tremble and do not sin; speak in your hearts upon your beds and be silent, Selah"). This daily domestic recitation represents one of the most intimate applications of the Psalms, demonstrating how biblical verse structures the rhythms of Jewish spiritual life from waking to rest.

The final imperative **וְדֹ֣מּוּ** (*v'dommu*, "and be silent/still") derives from the root דמם, which BDB defines as "be or grow dumb, silent, still." The semantic range includes cessation of speech but also physical stillness and even death. Radak glosses: "Be silent and cease rebelling against me, for *dimum* means the silence of speech and sound" (כי הדממה ענין שתיקת הדבור והקול). But the term can also mean "be at rest" or "be at peace"—a sense that resonates with the psalm's climactic verse about lying down to sleep in safety. The verse concludes with **סֶֽלָה** (selah), one of two such liturgical pauses in the psalm (the other at verse 3), marking this as a moment for congregational reflection. The Babylonian Talmud (Berakhot 4b-5a) takes this verse as paradigmatic for spiritual self-discipline, with Rabbi Levi bar Hama quoting Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish: "A person should always incite his good inclination against his evil inclination... If he subdues it, excellent. If not, let him engage in Torah study... If he subdues it, excellent. If not, let him recite the Shema... If he subdues it, excellent. If not, let him remind himself of the day of death." Each stage of this talmudic progression corresponds to one of the psalm's imperatives—trembling (recognition of mortality), speaking in the heart (Torah study), lying on the bed (Shema), and silence (contemplating death)—demonstrating how rabbinic tradition mined this verse for a complete program of evening spiritual discipline.

### Verse 6

**זִבְח֥וּ זִבְחֵי־צֶ֑דֶק וּ֝בִטְח֗וּ אֶל־יְהֹוָֽה׃**

The command to **זִבְח֥וּ זִבְחֵי־צֶ֑דֶק** (*zivchu zivchei-tzedeq*, "sacrifice sacrifices of righteousness") employs a cognate accusative construction—using verb and noun from the same root—that intensifies meaning through redundancy. This construction appears across biblical Hebrew to emphasize the quality or completeness of an action (cf. Genesis 2:17, **מ֥וֹת תָּמֽוּת**, "dying you shall die" = "you shall surely die"). Here, the doubled זבח/זבחי creates a wordplay that Radak captures: "Not sacrifices like those of the wicked, of which it is said (Proverbs 21:27), 'the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination' (זבח רשעים תועבה), for they return to their wickedness after the sacrifices" (שישובו לרשעתם אחר הזבחים). The crucial interpretive question is what makes a sacrifice "of righteousness" (צֶדֶק).

Three primary readings have emerged. First, the ethical-prerequisite interpretation: sacrifices offered by the righteous or accompanied by righteous conduct. This reading connects the psalm to the prophetic critique of empty ritual (Isaiah 1:11-17, Micah 6:6-8, Amos 5:21-24). Rashi allegorizes entirely: **הַצְדִּיקוּ מַעֲשֵׂיכֶם וַהֲרֵי אַתֶּם כִּמְקְרִיבִים זְבָחִים** (*hatzddiku ma'aseikhem vaharei atem kimkrivim z'vachim*, "Perform righteous deeds, and it will be as if you are offering sacrifices"). On this reading, no literal sacrifices are required—moral transformation itself becomes the offering. Second, the ritual-correctness interpretation: sacrifices offered according to proper procedure. Ibn Ezra identifies these as **שְׁלָמִים** (*shelamim*, peace offerings), "whose designated portions for the altar are offered not on account of an Asham (guilt offering) or a Chatat (sin offering)" but as pure thanksgiving. These are sacrifices of celebration rather than expiation, offered from gratitude not guilt. Third, the vindication interpretation: sacrifices offered because one's righteousness has been publicly vindicated. Malbim places the psalm "during the famine in David's days" (the three-year drought of 2 Samuel 21), when "scoffers of the generation said it was because of David's sin." When God revealed the famine was "for Saul and his bloody house" (2 Samuel 21:1), not David's transgression, David offered **זִבְחֵי צֶדֶק**—"thanksgiving offerings because his righteousness was clarified" (זבחי תודה בעבור שנתברר צדקו). On this reading, the צֶדֶק root in verse 2 (**אֱלֹהֵי צִדְקִי**, "God of my vindication") and verse 6 creates an inclusio: the "God of my vindication" calls for "sacrifices of vindication."

The lexical concordance reveals that **זִבְחֵי־צֶ֑דֶק** appears only three times in Scripture: here, Deuteronomy 33:19 (in Moses' blessing of Zebulun and Issachar, **שָׁ֖ם יִזְבְּח֣וּ זִבְחֵי־צֶ֑דֶק**, "there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness"), and Psalm 51:21 (**אָ֤ז תַּחְפֹּ֣ץ זִבְחֵי־צֶ֭דֶק עוֹלָ֣ה וְכָלִ֑יל**, "Then You will desire sacrifices of righteousness, burnt and whole offerings"). Psalm 51's context—David's penitential psalm after Nathan's confrontation about Bathsheba—makes the phrase programmatically post-ethical: only after genuine repentance (verse 19, "a broken and contrite heart") will God accept sacrifices. The Deuteronomy context links **זִבְחֵי־צֶ֑דֶק** to the tribes' worship "at the mountain" (Sinai or Tabor), suggesting pilgrimage offerings made at sacred sites. What unites these three uses is the notion that **זִבְחֵי־צֶ֑דֶק** are qualitatively distinct from routine or compulsory offerings—they express a right relationship between offerer and God, whether that rightness is ethical (Psalm 51), positional (Deuteronomy 33), or vindicatory (Psalm 4).

The second imperative **וּ֝בִטְח֗וּ אֶל־יְהֹוָֽה** (*u-vitchu el-YHWH*, "and trust in YHWH") shifts from cultic action to psychological-theological disposition. The verb בטח (to trust, be confident, secure) appears 120 times in the Hebrew Bible, most frequently in Psalms and Proverbs. The preposition אֶל (to, toward) rather than בְּ (in) is notable—Radak observes that בטח "is joined with the particle אל as with the particle על" (וקשר הבטח עם מלת אל כמו עם מלת על), citing Proverbs 3:5 (**בְּטַ֣ח אֶל־יְ֭הֹוָה בְּכׇל־לִבֶּ֑ךָ**, "Trust in YHWH with all your heart"). The spatial preposition suggests directionality—trust as orientation toward God rather than static confidence. Rashi reads this as rejecting material calculation: "Trust in the Lord to lavish upon you goodness, and do not sin against Him for money, in the hope that you will be rewarded by Saul" (וְאַל תֶּחֱטָאוּ לוֹ בִּשְׁבִיל מָמוֹן שֶׁאַתֶּם מְצַפִּים לְקַבֵּל שָׂכָר מֵאֵת שָׁאוּל). The juxtaposition of sacrifice and trust creates a theological pairing: right worship flows from right confidence. One cannot perform **זִבְחֵי־צֶ֑דֶק** while trusting in human patronage (Saul's reward) rather than divine providence. This verse thus completes the psalm's first movement: verses 2-3 establish the problem (opponents love emptiness, seek falsehood); verse 4 asserts God's distinguishing of the faithful; verses 5-6 instruct the opponents in proper response—interior reflection (verse 5) and exterior worship grounded in trust (verse 6). The phrase **זִבְח֥וּ זִבְחֵי־צֶ֑דֶק** appears in Edot HaMizrach liturgy both in the Seder Korban HaNesi'im (readings for the first thirteen days of Nissan commemorating Numbers 7) and in the Musaf Amidah for Shabbat, demonstrating how this unusual phrase traveled into multiple liturgical contexts where righteousness and worship intersect.

### Verse 7

**רַבִּ֥ים אֹמְרִים֮ מִֽי־יַרְאֵ֢נ֫וּ ט֥וֹב נְֽסָה־עָ֭לֵינוּ א֨וֹר פָּנֶ֬יךָ יְהֹוָֽה׃**

The verse pivots to quoted speech, introducing the skeptical voice of **רַבִּ֥ים** (*rabbim*, "many")—a collective that functions throughout Psalms as the voice of doubt, opposition, or conventional wisdom. Their question **מִֽי־יַרְאֵ֢נ֫וּ ט֥וֹב** (*mi yar'enu tov*, "Who will show us good?") encapsulates an epistemological crisis at the psalm's heart. The verb ראה (to see, perceive) in Hiphil (causative) stem means "to cause to see" or "show"—they are asking not "who will *do* good for us?" but "who will *demonstrate* good to us?" This is the cry of empirical despair, those who demand visible evidence before commitment. The term **ט֥וֹב** (*tov*, "good") is deliberately vague—does it mean prosperity, ethical goodness, material success, or existential well-being? Ibn Ezra reads it materially: "They desire that we should not see good, yet I was joyful when seeing them in a good state" (הם מתאוים שלא נראה טוב ואני הייתי שמח בראותי אותם בטוב). Radak connects this to Absalom's rebellion: "They say longingly in their rebellion, 'Who will show us prosperity?'—that the rebellion of Absalom might succeed, and David perish and his son become king" (מתאוים ואומרים במרדם: מי יראנו טוב שיצליח מרד אבשלום וימות דוד וימלוך בנו). The opponents' question reveals their prosperity-theology: they will align with whichever political figure can demonstrate material success.

The psalmist's response does not argue but prays: **נְֽסָה־עָ֭לֵינוּ א֨וֹר פָּנֶ֬יךָ יְהֹוָֽה** (*nesah-aleinu or panekha YHWH*, "Lift upon us the light of Your face, O YHWH"). This is one of Scripture's most evocative metaphors for divine favor, unmistakably echoing the Aaronic benediction of Numbers 6:25: **יָאֵ֨ר יְהֹוָ֧ה פָּנָ֛יו אֵלֶ֖יךָ וִיחֻנֶּֽךָּ** (*ya'er YHWH panav elekha vichuneka*, "May YHWH make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you"). The concordance shows that "light of face" imagery appears only four times in Psalms (4:7; 44:4; 89:16; Proverbs 16:15), always denoting divine favor and blessing. The verb **נְֽסָה** (*nesah*) has generated significant debate. Ibn Ezra and others understand it as a defective Hiphil form of נשא (to lift up, raise), missing the expected initial ה but phonetically identical (the nun assimilating): **הַנֵּס עָלֵינוּ** becomes **נְסָה עָלֵינוּ**. This interpretation links the verb to the "raising of a banner" (נֵס)—hence Rashi's gloss: "Raise up over us for a banner the light of Your countenance" (הָרֵם עָלֵינוּ לְנֵס אֶת אוֹר פָּנֶיךָ). Alternatively, some read it as related to the root נסה (to test, try), though this creates syntactic difficulties. The key theological claim is that divine favor—the "light of face"—is itself the **ט֥וֹב** (good) the skeptics seek, but it is not demonstrable through political fortune or material abundance.

The figurative language database reveals that "face of God" imagery pervades Scripture with multiple valences. God's "shining face" connotes favor and blessing (Numbers 6:25, Psalm 67:2, 80:4), while God's "hidden face" signals judgment or abandonment (Deuteronomy 31:17-18, Psalm 13:2, 27:9). Psalm 44:4 uses this same construction to explain Israel's conquest: **וְא֥וֹר פָּנֶ֗יךָ כִּ֣י רְצִיתָֽם** (*v'or panekha ki retzitam*, "and the light of Your face, for You favored them")—not military prowess but divine favor explains victory. The psalmist's prayer thus reframes the skeptics' question: they ask "who will show us good?" assuming good is empirically demonstrable prosperity; the psalmist responds that **ט֥וֹב** is the experience of divine presence, which cannot be proven to external observers but is known in intimate relationship. Meiri reads the verse as presenting two contrasting worldviews: "Many only desire the good of this world (טובת העולם הזה) and long for it, saying 'Who will show us good?' But we—all our desire is for the light of Your face" (אבל אנחנו כל תאוותינו לאור פניך). This verse has profound liturgical afterlife: the phrase **נְֽסָה־עָ֭לֵינוּ א֨וֹר פָּנֶ֬יךָ יְהֹוָֽה** appears in Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur liturgy across Edot HaMizrach traditions, integrated into the Amidah's reader's repetition where it functions as petition for divine illumination during the Days of Awe. In the Yom Kippur Mussaf Seder HaAvodah, it appears within the recounting of Temple service, linking the priestly blessing's "light of face" to the High Priest's sacred mediation. The consistent liturgical placement during penitential seasons suggests Jewish tradition understood this verse as expressing fundamental human need—not for prosperity but for divine presence—making it paradigmatic for moments when the community stands vulnerable before God.

### Verse 8

**נָתַ֣תָּה שִׂמְחָ֣ה בְלִבִּ֑י מֵעֵ֬ת דְּגָנָ֖ם וְתִירוֹשָׁ֣ם רָֽבּוּ׃**

The psalmist's testimony of contentment (**נָתַ֣תָּה שִׂמְחָ֣ה בְלִבִּ֑י**, *natata simchah b'libi*, "You have put joy in my heart") directly answers the skeptics' question from verse 7. The perfect tense **נָתַ֣תָּה** (You have given/put) signals accomplished fact—this is not petition but confident declaration of present experience. The root שמח (to rejoice, be glad) appears 156 times across Scripture, predominantly in contexts of worship, covenant fidelity, and festival celebration. The phrase **בְלִבִּ֑י** (*b'libi*, "in my heart") locates this joy internally, contrasting with the external, observable prosperity the opponents pursue. Radak emphasizes this interiority: "Behold, they requite me evil for good, but as for me, there was gladness in my heart at their prosperity" (הנה הם גומלים לי רעה תחת טובה כי אני היתה לי שמחה בלבי בטובתם). The psalmist claims an inverted economy of joy—he rejoices *at* their success rather than resenting it, demonstrating the generosity of spirit that flows from trust in God rather than competition for finite resources.

The comparative structure **מֵעֵ֬ת דְּגָנָ֖ם וְתִירוֹשָׁ֣ם רָֽבּוּ** (*me'et deganam v'tirosham rabu*, "from/more than [the] time their grain and wine multiplied") is syntactically ambiguous, and the ambiguity is theologically productive. The preposition **מֵעֵת** (*me'et*) can function temporally ("from the time when") or comparatively ("more than"). Most commentators prefer the comparative reading, establishing a value contrast: divine joy exceeds material prosperity. Rabbi Yehuda ibn Balaam (cited by Ibn Ezra) argued for inversion: "the true [reading] is **מֵעֵת רָבוּ דְגָנָם וְתִירוֹשָׁם**" (from the time their grain and wine multiplied), making the phrase purely temporal. But Ibn Ezra rightly rejects this emendation: "There is no need to invert words spoken through the Holy Spirit" (ואין צורך להפך דברים נאמרים ברוח הקדש). The comparative reading is both grammatically defensible and theologically richer: **שִׂמְחָ֣ה בְלִבִּ֑י** (joy in my heart) exceeds **דְּגָנָ֖ם וְתִירוֹשָׁ֣ם רָֽבּוּ** (their multiplied grain and wine).

The pairing **דָּגָן** (grain) and **תִּירוֹשׁ** (new wine) is a standard merism—a figure of speech where two complementary items represent a totality. This word-pair appears 26 times across Scripture, always signifying comprehensive agricultural prosperity and covenant blessing. Deuteronomy 7:13 exemplifies this usage: **וַאֲהֵ֣בְךָ֔ וּבֵרַכְךָ֖ וְהִרְבֶּ֑ךָ וּבֵרַ֣ךְ פְּרִי־בִטְנְךָ֣ וּפְרִי־אַ֠דְמָתְךָ֠ דְּגָ֨נְךָ֜ וְתִֽירֹשְׁךָ֣ וְיִצְהָרֶ֗ךָ** ("He will love you and bless you and multiply you; He will bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your land, your grain and wine and oil"). The triad grain-wine-oil (דגן ותירוש ויצהר) represents the full agricultural blessing cycle, but our psalm employs only the first two terms, perhaps because the dyad suffices for the merism's function. Hosea 2:8-9 uses this same pairing polemically, depicting Israel's spiritual adultery: **וְהִ֣יא לֹא־יָדְעָ֗ה כִּ֤י אָנֹכִי֙ נָתַ֣תִּי לָ֔הּ הַדָּגָ֖ן וְהַתִּיר֣וֹשׁ וְהַיִּצְהָ֑ר** ("She did not know that it was I who gave her the grain, the wine, and the oil")—Israel credits Baal for agricultural success that actually comes from YHWH. Psalm 4 inverts this error: the opponents pursue grain and wine as ultimate goods; the psalmist recognizes that even when they achieve such prosperity, his divinely-given joy exceeds theirs.

The verb **רָֽבּוּ** (*rabu*, "they multiplied/increased") from the root רבב (to be many, become numerous) emphasizes abundance. The root appears 228 times in Scripture, frequently in contexts of divine blessing (Genesis 1:22, "be fruitful and multiply," פְּר֥וּ וּרְב֖וּ). The lexical concordance shows this root in Psalm 3:2 (**מָה־רַבּ֣וּ צָרָ֑י רַ֝בִּ֗ים קָמִ֥ים עָלָֽי**, "How numerous are my adversaries! Many rise against me"), creating a verbal bridge between these adjacent psalms: enemies multiply (Psalm 3), but so does opponents' prosperity (Psalm 4)—yet neither threatens the psalmist's fundamental security. The verse thus crystallizes the psalm's central theological claim: true security and joy derive not from possession of the covenant blessings (grain and wine) but from relationship with the covenant God who bestows them. This is not ascetic rejection of material goods—the psalmist does not denigrate **דָּגָן** and **תִּירוֹשׁ**—but rather a reordering of value hierarchy. Even when the opponents' harvests succeed (רָֽבּוּ), divine **שִׂמְחָ֣ה** surpasses material abundance because its source is covenantal relationship, not agricultural fortune. Malbim, reading the psalm against the backdrop of the three-year famine (2 Samuel 21), sees this verse as climactic testimony: "Now You have put joy in my heart from the time their grain and wine began to multiply when the famine ceased" (נתתה שמחה בלבי מן העת שהתחילו להרבות דגנם ותירושם כשנפסק הרעב). On this reading, the psalmist's joy comes precisely at the moment when rain returns and harvests resume—not because *he* gets grain and wine, but because God's vindication of his righteousness (the famine was not due to his sin) is demonstrated through the breaking of the drought.

### Verse 9

**בְּשָׁל֣וֹם יַחְדָּו֮ אֶשְׁכְּבָ֢ה וְאִ֫ישָׁ֥ן כִּֽי־אַתָּ֣ה יְהֹוָ֣ה לְבָדָ֑ד לָ֝בֶ֗טַח תּוֹשִׁיבֵֽנִי׃**

The psalm's climactic testimony deploys three distinct terms for rest: **אֶשְׁכְּבָ֢ה** (*eshk'vah*, "I lie down"), **וְאִ֫ישָׁ֥ן** (*v'ishan*, "and I sleep"), and **לָ֝בֶ֗טַח תּוֹשִׁיבֵֽנִי** (*lavetach toshiveini*, "[You cause me] to dwell in security"). This triad transforms the mundane act of going to bed into a theological statement—sleep becomes the ultimate test and proof of covenantal trust. The opening phrase **בְּשָׁל֣וֹם יַחְדָּו֮** (*b'shalom yachdav*, "in peace together") has generated significant interpretive discussion, particularly regarding the function of **יַחְדָּו֮** (together/at once). Ibn Ezra notes two possible referents: "the many [his followers], and he with them" (הרבים והוא עמהם), suggesting communal security, or "I [was] together with them" versus "I [would be] alone" (או היו יחדו עמי, או הייתי לבדד), contrasting social support with solitude. The term **יַחְדָּו֮** appears 141 times in Scripture, predominantly meaning "together" in spatial or temporal proximity, but occasionally "at once" or "simultaneously."

The choice between these senses affects the verse's theology. If "together," the psalmist affirms that **שָׁל֣וֹם** (peace/safety) is experienced communally—he can lie down securely with his household or followers. If "at once," the emphasis falls on immediacy: lying down and sleeping happen together, without the anxious insomnia that afflicts the fearful. Radak synthesizes these readings: "I desire that we may be in peace together (בשלום יחדיו), I and they, and that if I lay me down and sleep I may not have anything to disturb me from sleep" (שנהיה בשלום יחדיו אני והם, ואם אשכבה ואישן שלא יהיה לי דבר המטריד אותי מהשינה). The pairing **אֶשְׁכְּבָ֢ה וְאִ֫ישָׁ֥ן** (lie down and sleep) appears in Psalm 3:6 with identical vocabulary: **אֲנִ֥י שָׁכַ֗בְתִּי וָאִ֫ישָׁ֥נָה הֱקִיצ֑וֹתִי כִּ֖י יְהֹוָ֣ה יִסְמְכֵֽנִי** ("I lay down and slept; I awoke, for YHWH sustains me"), creating a verbal bridge between these adjacent psalms. Both psalms test theology through vulnerability—the capacity to relinquish consciousness demonstrates trust in divine protection.

The causal clause **כִּֽי־אַתָּ֣ה יְהֹוָ֣ה לְבָדָ֑ד** (*ki-atah YHWH l'vadad*, "for You, YHWH, alone") introduces a syntactic ambiguity that has generated centuries of interpretive debate. Does **לְבָדָ֑ד** (alone/solitary) modify "You YHWH alone" (monotheistic emphasis: only You provide security) or "me dwelling alone" (psychological emphasis: I am secure even in solitude)? Ibn Ezra notes both readings are grammatically valid, and the ambiguity may be deliberate—the psalmist dwells alone *because* YHWH alone provides security. BDB lexicon treats **בָּדָד** as an adverbial substantive meaning "in isolation, separately" (cf. Numbers 23:9, **הֶן־עָם֙ לְבָדָ֣ד יִשְׁכֹּ֔ן**, "a people dwelling alone," describing Israel's distinctive status). The term appears in Deuteronomy 33:28's description of Israelite blessing: **וַיִּשְׁכֹּן֩ יִשְׂרָאֵ֨ל בֶּ֤טַח בָּדָד֙ עֵ֣ין יַעֲקֹ֔ב אֶל־אֶ֖רֶץ דָּגָ֣ן וְתִיר֑וֹשׁ** ("Israel dwelt in safety, alone, the fountain of Jacob in a land of grain and wine"). Whereas Deuteronomy's blessing depends on agricultural abundance (דָּגָן וְתִירוֹשׁ—the same phrase as Psalm 4:8!), Psalm 4 locates security in God's presence independent of harvest success. Radak resolves the ambiguity theologically: "You YHWH alone will do this, and in You is my confidence and in no other" (אתה יי' לבדך תעשה זה ובך בטחוני ולא באחר).

The final phrase **לָ֝בֶ֗טַח תּוֹשִׁיבֵֽנִי** (*lavetach toshiveini*, "in security You cause me to dwell") employs the Hiphil (causative) form of ישב (to sit, dwell, inhabit). The root appears 1,088 times across Scripture, making it one of the most frequent verbs, with semantic range from temporary sitting to permanent dwelling. The causative Hiphil emphasizes divine agency—God is the active subject who establishes the psalmist's security. The term **בֶּ֗טַח** (security, safety) derives from בטח (to trust), creating an etymological connection between trust (verse 6, **וּבִטְחוּ אֶל־יְהֹוָֽה**) and security (verse 9, **לָבֶטַח**). This is not merely wordplay but theological logic: trust *produces* security because God honors those who rely on Him. The figurative language database shows "dwelling in security" appears 23 times across Scripture, predominantly in contexts describing covenant blessing (Leviticus 25:18-19, 26:5; Deuteronomy 12:10; 1 Kings 5:5). Jeremiah 23:6 and 33:16 link **לָבֶטַח** directly to the Messianic title **יְהוָה צִדְקֵנוּ** ("YHWH our righteousness")—the same צדק root that opened the psalm (**אֱלֹהֵי צִדְקִי**, verse 2). The psalm thus comes full circle: it began with petition to the "God of my vindication" and concludes with testimony of secure dwelling—vindication and security prove inseparable.

This verse's liturgical reception demonstrates its enduring power as a bedtime prayer. It appears in the Kriat Shema al HaMitah (Bedtime Shema) across both Ashkenazic and Sefardic traditions, where it functions as the climactic statement before sleep. The juxtaposition is theologically apt: the Shema declares monotheistic faith (**שְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל יְהֹוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ יְהֹוָה אֶחָד**, "Hear O Israel, YHWH our God, YHWH is One"); Psalm 4:9 enacts that faith by demonstrating trust through the vulnerable relinquishment of consciousness. The psalm's evening setting reverses the opponents' daytime pursuits—while they chase grain and wine (verse 8), the faithful can release consciousness itself into divine care (verse 9). Malbim reads this verse as the psalm's interpretive key, finding a deliberate intertextual echo with Deuteronomy 33:28: "He depicts himself as if lying down together with peace (שוכב ביחד עם השלום), for You, YHWH, alone cause me to dwell securely" (כי אתה ה' לבדד לבטח תושיבני תפס המליצה ממ"ש וישכן ישראל בטח בדד עין יעקב אל ארץ דגן ותירוש). The Deuteronomy verse continues, "His heavens also drop down dew" (אף שמיו יערפו טל), suggesting that security comes not when grain and wine have already multiplied but when rain returns—when God's favor is manifest through renewed fertility. On this reading, the psalmist's security rests not on present abundance but on confidence in divine provision, making sleep the ultimate enactment of trust: I can close my eyes because You keep watch; I can relinquish control because You remain sovereign; I can rest in vulnerability because You alone provide security.
