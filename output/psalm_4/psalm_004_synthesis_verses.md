## Verse 1

**לַמְנַצֵּ֥חַ בִּנְגִינ֑וֹת מִזְמ֥וֹר לְדָוִֽד**

The superscription introduces technical terminology that locates this psalm within ancient Israel's liturgical apparatus. The term **לַמְנַצֵּחַ** (la-menatzeach, "for the director/conductor") appears in 55 psalm titles, suggesting a formal collection or designation for temple performance. The root **נ.צ.ח** (n.ts.ch) occurs with this specialized meaning exclusively in Chronicles and psalm superscriptions, where it denotes those appointed to conduct temple worship—not merely to perform, but to oversee and direct the liturgical enterprise. In 1 Chronicles 15:21, the Levitical **מְנַצְּחִים** (menatschim, "conductors") are specifically assigned "to lead with lyres according to the Sheminith" (**לְנַצֵּ֖חַ עַל־הַשְּׁמִינִֽית** / le-natseach al ha-sheminit), coordinating bass voices with instrumental accompaniment. This suggests that **לַמְנַצֵּחַ** indicates not just authorial attribution or dedication, but institutional function: these psalms were drawn from what scholars now call "the Director's Collection," a major liturgical anthology predating the final Psalter's compilation.

The second designation, **בִּנְגִינוֹת** (bi-nginot, "with/on stringed instruments"), appears in only six psalm titles (Psalms 4, 6, 54, 55, 67, 76, plus Habakkuk 3:19). The noun **נְגִינָה** (neginah) denotes instrumental music, particularly stringed instruments (related to the verb **נ.ג.ן** / n.g.n, "to play a stringed instrument"). Significantly, these psalms share an evening or contemplative character: Psalm 4 explicitly mentions lying down at night (v. 9), Psalm 6 is a nighttime lament, and Psalm 55 describes evening prayer. This may indicate that **בִּנְגִינוֹת** designated pieces for evening worship accompanied by lyre or harp, contrasting with wind instruments (**נְחִילוֹת** / nechilot, "flutes") used elsewhere (Psalm 5:1).

The Davidic attribution (**מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד** / mizmor le-David) aligns with traditional Jewish interpretation connecting this psalm to Absalom's rebellion (Radak, Meiri). While modern scholarship debates authorial ascription, the ancient liturgical tradition treated these superscriptions as canonical guidance for performance context and theological interpretation—not merely as historical claims but as hermeneutical keys unlocking the psalm's liturgical function.

## Verse 2

**בְּקׇרְאִ֡י עֲנֵ֤נִי ׀ אֱלֹ֘הֵ֤י צִדְקִ֗י בַּ֭צָּר הִרְחַ֣בְתָּ לִּ֑י חׇ֝נֵּ֗נִי וּשְׁמַ֥ע תְּפִלָּתִֽי**

The psalm's opening petition contains a unique divine epithet appearing nowhere else in Scripture: **אֱלֹהֵי צִדְקִי** ('elohei tzidqi, "God of my righteousness/vindication"). The construct chain fuses relationship ("my God") with forensic vindication (**צֶדֶק** / tzedek), establishing the psalm's underlying legal metaphor. This is not merely "righteous God" but "the God who vindicates my righteousness"—implying a contested claim requiring divine adjudication. The epithet positions the speaker as defendant in an honor-shame trial, appealing to the ultimate Judge who alone can restore reputation against false accusers. BDB's entry for **צֶדֶק** emphasizes this forensic dimension: "rightness, justice, in a case or cause" (Psalm 35:27; Job 6:29). The suffix construction (**צִדְקִי** / tzidki, "my righteousness") personalizes the claim: God must defend *my* specific vindication, not merely abstract justice.

The petition itself employs a triadic imperative structure with ascending intensity: **עֲנֵנִי** ('aneni, "answer me"), **חׇנֵּנִי** (choneni, "be gracious to me"), **וּשְׁמַע** (u-shema', "and hear"). This is standard lament rhetoric, but the middle clause interrupts the sequence with past-tense testimony: **בַּצָּר הִרְחַבְתָּ לִּי** (ba-tzar hirchavta li, "in distress you made wide for me"). The spatial metaphor draws on the common biblical opposition between **צַר** (tzar, "narrow, constricted") and **רָחָב** (rachav, "wide, spacious"). Physical constriction represents existential distress, while expansion signifies deliverance. Compare Psalm 18:20: **וַיּוֹצִיאֵנִי לַמֶּרְחָב** (va-yotzi'eni la-merchav, "He brought me out into a broad place"), and Psalm 118:5: **מִן־הַמֵּצַר קָרָאתִי יָּהּ עָנָנִי בַמֶּרְחָב יָהּ** (min ha-metzar karati Yah 'anani va-merchav Yah, "From distress I called to Yah; Yah answered me with expansiveness"). The perfect verb **הִרְחַבְתָּ** (hirchavta, "you made wide") grounds present petition in past experience: "You did this before; do it again." This creates what Walter Brueggemann calls "a mode of plea-bargain with God," where prior deliverance becomes grounds for renewed intervention.

Radak explains the past deliverance as referring to David's earlier escapes from Saul, now invoked during Absalom's rebellion. Ibn Ezra emphasizes the forensic context: God is **הַסִּבָּה הָרִאשׁוֹנָה לְהַרְאוֹת צִדְקִי** (ha-sibah ha-rishonah le-har'ot tzidki, "the primary cause for showing my righteousness")—the ultimate arbiter who can publicly demonstrate the speaker's innocence. The verse thus establishes the psalm's double movement: from constriction to expansion, from private distress to public vindication.

## Verse 3

**בְּנֵ֥י אִ֡ישׁ עַד־מֶ֬ה כְבוֹדִ֣י לִ֭כְלִמָּה תֶּאֱהָב֣וּן רִ֑יק תְּבַקְשׁ֖וּ כָזָ֣ב סֶֽלָה**

The psalm executes a dramatic vocative shift unprecedented in standard lament form. Rather than continuing to address God or complaining *about* adversaries *to* God, the speaker turns directly *to* the opponents themselves: **בְּנֵי אִישׁ** (benei 'ish, "sons of man"). This phrase typically designates humanity's elite—not commoners (**בְּנֵי אָדָם** / benei 'adam) but the nobility, as in Psalm 49:3's parallel structure: **גַּם־בְּנֵי אָדָם גַּם־בְּנֵי־אִישׁ יַחַד עָשִׁיר וְאֶבְיוֹן** (gam benei 'adam gam benei 'ish yachad 'ashir ve-'evyon, "both low and high, rich and poor together"). The BDB entry confirms: **בְּנֵי אִישׁ** denotes "men of rank" (1 Samuel 26:15: "Art thou not a man [**אִישׁ** / 'ish]? and who is like to thee in Israel?"). The direct address thus intensifies the confrontation: these are not street rabble but David's former peers, the kingdom's power brokers who should have known better.

The rhetorical question **עַד־מֶה** ('ad-meh, "how long?") is conventional lament vocabulary (Psalms 6:4; 13:2-3; 74:10; 79:5), but its target here is unusual—directed at humans, not God. The grievance concerns honor transformation: **כְבוֹדִי לִכְלִמָּה** (kevodi li-khlimah, "my glory into shame"). The noun **כָּבוֹד** (kavod, "glory/honor") has a semantic range encompassing personal reputation, royal dignity, and even divine presence (the **כְּבוֹד יְהוָה** / kevod Adonai of Exodus 16:7, 10). Here it clearly means the speaker's public standing—what anthropologists call "achieved honor" requiring constant defense in Mediterranean shame-honor cultures. The opponents are actively engaged in honor reversal, replacing **כָּבוֹד** (kavod) with **כְּלִמָּה** (khlimah, "shame, disgrace"). Rashi cites the taunts of 1 Samuel 20:30 and 25:10 ("Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse?"), where Saul and Nabal treat royal anointing as pretension worthy of mockery.

The accusation then specifies their method through two parallel verbs: **תֶּאֱהָבוּן רִיק תְּבַקְשׁוּ כָזָב** (te'ehavun riq tevakshu khazav, "you love emptiness, you seek falsehood"). Both **רִיק** (riq, "emptiness") and **כָּזָב** (khazav, "lie, falsehood") carry idolatrous overtones elsewhere in Scripture. The term **רִיק** appears in Deuteronomy 32:21 for "non-gods" (**בְּלֹא־אֵל** / be-lo 'el), and Jeremiah 2:5 uses **הֶבֶל** (hevel, "vapor"), a near-synonym, for Canaanite deities. Similarly, **כָּזָב** designates false prophecy (Ezekiel 13:6-9) and deceptive oracles. The opponents' political rebellion is thus implicitly idolatrous—they pursue **רִיק**, substantieless promises, as though trusting in false gods rather than YHWH's anointed. Ibn Ezra connects this to Absalom's usurpation: "a thing that will not stand" (**דָּבָר שֶׁלֹּא יִתְקַיֵּם** / davar she-lo' yitkayem). Radak makes the charge explicit: **דָּבָר שֶׁלֹּא יִתְקַיֵּם וְהוּא מַלְכוּת אַבְשָׁלוֹם** (davar she-lo' yitkayem ve-hu' malkhut Avshalom, "a thing that will not be established, namely Absalom's kingship").

The verse concludes with **סֶלָה** (selah), the first of two pause markers in this psalm (also v. 5). This enigmatic term, appearing 71 times in Psalms and three times in Habakkuk 3, likely signals a musical or dramatic pause—perhaps for instrumental interlude or congregational response. Here it punctuates the confrontational challenge, allowing the accusation to resonate before instruction begins.

## Verse 4

**וּדְע֗וּ כִּֽי־הִפְלָ֣ה יְ֭הֹוָה חָסִ֣יד ל֑וֹ יְהֹוָ֥ה יִ֝שְׁמַ֗ע בְּקׇרְאִ֥י אֵלָֽיו**

The didactic mode continues with a double imperative of knowledge: **וּדְעוּ** (u-de'u, "know!"). This shifts from accusation to instruction—the opponents must learn theological reality. The verb **יָדַע** (yada', "to know") in biblical Hebrew implies not mere cognition but experiential recognition leading to appropriate response. The content of this knowledge is YHWH's election: **כִּי־הִפְלָה יְהֹוָה חָסִיד לוֹ** (ki hiflah Adonai chasid lo, "that YHWH has set apart a faithful one for Himself").

The key verb **הִפְלָה** (hiflah, Hiphil of **פ.ל.א** / p.l.'), raises interpretive questions. BDB offers "make separate, set apart, distinguish" with a primary example from Exodus 9:4: **וְהִפְלָה יְהוָה בֵּין מִקְנֵה יִשְׂרָאֵל וּבֵין מִקְנֵה מִצְרָיִם** (ve-hiflah Adonai bein mikneh Yisra'el u-vein mikneh Mitzrayim, "and YHWH will distinguish between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt"). The same root generates the noun **פֶּלֶא** (pele', "wonder, marvel"), suggesting that this "setting apart" involves something wondrous or extraordinary—not merely selection but supernatural distinction. Ibn Ezra glosses: **הִבְדִּיל וְהוֹדִיעַ** (hivdil ve-hodia', "He distinguished and made known"), emphasizing both separation and public demonstration. Radak connects this to Deuteronomy 10:8's election of Levi: **בַּעֵת הַהִוא הִבְדִּיל יְהוָה אֶת־שֵׁבֶט הַלֵּוִי** (ba-'et ha-hi' hivdil Adonai et shevet ha-Levi, "At that time YHWH set apart the tribe of Levi").

The object of election is the **חָסִיד** (chasid, "faithful/pious one"). This term, appearing 32 times in Psalms alone, denotes covenantal loyalty—one who practices **חֶסֶד** (chesed, "covenant faithfulness"). The suffix **לוֹ** (lo, "for Himself") is emphatic: God has personally claimed this individual as His own portion. The verse thus asserts David's divine election against Absalom's rebellion—the covenant Lord has already "singled out" His chosen, rendering human opposition futile.

The second half creates an inclusio with verse 2's opening petition: **יְהֹוָה יִשְׁמַע בְּקׇרְאִי אֵלָיו** (Adonai yishma' be-kor'i 'elav, "YHWH hears when I call to Him"). The imperfect verb **יִשְׁמַע** (yishma', "he hears") functions as a habitual or gnomic present: this is God's characteristic response to His chosen. Verse 2 petitioned **עֲנֵנִי** ('aneni, "answer me"); verse 4 testifies **יִשְׁמַע** (yishma', "He hears"). The psalm thus enacts answered prayer *within its own structure*—demonstrating the claim by performing it. The enemies are told: "Know that God hears me" even as the psalmist addresses them rather than God, confidence so secure it can momentarily turn away from petition to instruction. This rhetorical strategy—answered prayer demonstrated through confident confrontation of adversaries—recurs in Psalms 3:8-9, 6:9-10, and 27:3.

## Verse 5

**רִגְז֗וּ וְֽאַל־תֶּחֱטָ֫א֥וּ אִמְר֣וּ בִ֭לְבַבְכֶם עַֽל־מִשְׁכַּבְכֶ֗ם וְדֹ֣מּוּ סֶֽלָה**

This verse bristles with interpretive difficulty, beginning with the enigmatic imperative **רִגְזוּ** (rigzu). The root **ר.ג.ז** (r.g.z) has a semantic range spanning "tremble, rage, be agitated, quake." BDB lists Deuteronomy 2:25 (**וְרָגְזוּ וְחָלוּ מִפָּנֶיךָ** / ve-ragzu ve-chalu mi-panekha, "they shall tremble and be in anguish because of you") alongside Genesis 45:24 (**אַל־תִּרְגְזוּ בַדָּרֶךְ** / al tirgzu va-derekh, "do not quarrel on the way"). The Septuagint chose **ὀργίζεσθε** (orgizesthe, "be angry"), famously cited by Paul in Ephesians 4:26: **ὀργίζεσθε καὶ μὴ ἁμαρτάνετε** (orgizesthe kai mē hamartanete, "be angry and do not sin"). The Vulgate followed with *irascimini* ("be angry"), establishing this as Western Christianity's received reading.

Yet medieval Jewish commentators resisted this path. Rashi glosses **חִרְדוּ מִלִּפְנֵי הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא** (chirdu mi-lifnei ha-Kadosh Barukh Hu', "tremble before the Holy One, blessed be He"), interpreting fear of God, not anger, as the proper response. Ibn Ezra similarly: **רִגְזוּ מֵהַשֵּׁם פַּחֲדוּ** (rigzu me-ha-Shem pachadu, "tremble out of fear of HaShem"), citing Genesis 45:24 where **תִּרְגְזוּ** means "quarrel"—but here understanding "tremble" as the king's awareness of mockery directed at him. Radak follows: **עִנְיַן פַּחַד כְּמוֹ וְרָגְזוּ וְחָלוּ** ('inyan pachad kemo ve-ragzu ve-chalu, "meaning fear, as in 'they shall tremble and be in anguish'"). The Talmud (Berakhot 5a) employs the verse homiletically, with Rabbi Levi bar Chama teaching: **לְעוֹלָם יַרְגִּיז אָדָם יֵצֶר טוֹב עַל יֵצֶר הָרַע** (le-'olam yargiz 'adam yetzer tov 'al yetzer ha-ra', "A person should always incite the good inclination against the evil inclination")—reading **רִגְזוּ** as "stir up, provoke."

The ambiguity may be deliberate. Perhaps the verse commands: "Be agitated [by what you've done]—but don't let that agitation lead to sin." Emotional disturbance in itself is not sin; it's the response to disturbance that matters. The imperative sequence builds from emotional state to introspection to silence: **אִמְרוּ בִלְבַבְכֶם עַל־מִשְׁכַּבְכֶם וְדֹמּוּ** (imru vi-levavkhem 'al mishkavkhem ve-dommu, "speak in your hearts upon your beds and be silent").

The phrase **אִמְרוּ בִלְבַבְכֶם** (imru vi-levavkhem, "speak in your hearts") is standard biblical Hebrew for internal reflection—not audible speech but thought (Isaiah 47:8: **הָאֹמְרָה בִּלְבָבָהּ** / ha-'omrah bi-levavah, "the one who says in her heart"). The temporal/locational phrase **עַל־מִשְׁכַּבְכֶם** ('al mishkavkhem, "upon your beds") introduces the evening setting crucial to the psalm's structure. Night, in biblical anthropology, is the time of honest self-reckoning when day's distractions cease. Radak explains: **כִּי הָאָדָם עַל מִשְׁכָּבוֹ יִמְצָא לִבּוֹ יוֹתֵר פָּנוּי מֵעִסְקֵי הָעוֹלָם וְאָז תִּהְיֶה כַוָּנָתוֹ זַכָּה** (ki ha-'adam 'al mishkavo yimtza libo yoter panuy me-'iskei ha-'olam ve-'az tihyeh kavvanato zakkah, "for a person upon his bed finds his heart more free from worldly concerns, and then his intention will be pure").

The final imperative **וְדֹמּוּ** (ve-dommu, "and be silent") completes the progression from agitation through reflection to cessation of speech. The root **ד.מ.ם** (d.m.m) means "to be still, silent" (Lamentations 2:10: **יֵשְׁבוּ לָאָרֶץ יִדְּמוּ** / yeshvu la-'aretz yiddomu, "they sit on the ground in silence"). This is not merely absence of sound but the stillness of submission. The Talmud (Berakhot 4b-5a) interpreted this verse as mandating the bedtime Shema, Rabbi Joshua ben Levi deriving the practice from **עַל־מִשְׁכַּבְכֶם** ('al mishkavkhem, "upon your beds"). What was originally instruction to adversaries became liturgical prescription for the pious—the psalm's enemies transformed into a model of nocturnal devotion. The second **סֶלָה** (selah) punctuates this instruction sequence, marking the transition from confrontation to ritual command.

## Verse 6

**זִבְח֥וּ זִבְחֵי־צֶ֑דֶק וּ֝בִטְח֗וּ אֶל־יְהֹוָֽה**

The dual imperatives—**זִבְחוּ** (zivchu, "offer") and **וּבִטְחוּ** (u-vitchu, "and trust")—pair external ritual with internal disposition, the biblical pattern insisting that cult without heart-orientation is bankrupt. But the phrase **זִבְחֵי־צֶדֶק** (zivchei tzedek, "sacrifices of righteousness") remains ambiguous. The genitive construction allows multiple interpretations: (1) sacrifices *characterized by* righteousness—morally upright offerings; (2) sacrifices *performed according to* righteousness—ritually correct oblations; (3) sacrifices *resulting from* righteousness—worship flowing from repentance.

The phrase appears only twice elsewhere: Deuteronomy 33:19 (in Moses' blessing of Zebulun and Issachar: **שָׁם יִזְבְּחוּ זִבְחֵי־צֶדֶק** / sham yizbechu zivchei tzedek, "there they will offer sacrifices of righteousness") and Psalm 51:21 (in David's penitential psalm: **אָז תַּחְפֹּץ זִבְחֵי־צֶדֶק עוֹלָה וְכָלִיל** / 'az tachpotz zivchei tzedek 'olah ve-khalil, "then You will desire sacrifices of righteousness, burnt offering and whole offering"). The Psalm 51 context clarifies: these are sacrifices God *wants*, contrasted with offerings brought while the worshiper remains morally compromised. Proverbs 21:27 declares: **זֶבַח רְשָׁעִים תּוֹעֵבָה** (zevach resha'im to'evah, "the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination")—not because the ritual is improperly executed but because wickedness continues after the offering.

Radak makes this explicit: **שֶׁתָּשׁוּבוּ וְלֹא כְזִבְחֵי רְשָׁעִים שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר בָּהֶם זֶבַח רְשָׁעִים תּוֹעֵבָה שֶׁיָּשׁוּבוּ לְרִשְׁעָתָם אַחַר הַזְּבָחִים** (she-tashuvu ve-lo' khe-zivchei resha'im she-ne'emar bahem zevach resha'im to'evah she-yashuvu le-rish'atam 'achar ha-zevachim, "that you should repent, and not like the sacrifices of the wicked of which it is said 'the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination' because they return to their wickedness after the sacrifices"). The issue is continuity: Will the sacrifice mark genuine transformation, or will the offerer revert to former ways? Rashi spiritualizes aggressively: **הַצְדִּיקוּ מַעֲשֵׂיכֶם וַהֲרֵי אַתֶּם כִּמְקְרִיבִים זְבָחִים** (hatzzdiku ma'aseikhem va-harei 'attem ki-mekrivin zevachim, "Make your deeds righteous, and behold you are as if offering sacrifices")—implying that ethical rectitude itself *constitutes* the sacrifice, not merely accompanies it.

Ibn Ezra identifies these specifically as **שְׁלָמִים** (shelamim, "peace offerings"), whose designated portions go to the altar **לֹא בַעֲבוּר אָשָׁם אוֹ חַטָּאת** (lo' va-'avur 'asham 'o chatat, "not on account of a guilt offering or a sin offering"). These are voluntary thank offerings expressing gratitude and communion with God—not expiatory rituals mandated by transgression. The distinction matters: the adversaries are called not to atone for sin (though that's implied) but to *celebrate* by acknowledging YHWH's sovereignty through grateful worship.

The second imperative, **וּבִטְחוּ אֶל־יְהוָה** (u-vitchu 'el Adonai, "and trust in YHWH"), makes explicit what the first implies. The verb **בָּטַח** (batach, "to trust, rely on") frequently governs the preposition **בְּ** (be, "in"), but here **אֶל־** ('el, "to/toward") appears—a construction Radak notes occurs elsewhere (**בְּטַח אֶל־יְהוָה בְּכָל־לִבֶּךָ** / betach 'el Adonai be-khol libekha, "Trust in YHWH with all your heart," Proverbs 3:5). The cultic act and the faith disposition are coordinate imperatives, neither sufficient alone. Metzudat David captures the logic: **הַצְדִּיקוּ מַעֲשֵׂיכֶם וְיֵחָשֵׁב לַה' כִּזְבָחִים וְאָז בִּטְחוּ בוֹ כִּי יֵשׁ תִּקְוָה** (hatzzdiku ma'aseikhem ve-yechashev la-Shem ki-zevachim ve-'az bitchu vo ki yesh tikvah, "Make your deeds righteous and it will be reckoned to HaShem as sacrifices, and then trust in Him for there is hope").

## Verse 7

**רַבִּ֥ים אֹֽמְרִים֮ מִֽי־יַרְאֵ֢נ֫וּ ט֥וֹב נְֽסָה־עָ֭לֵינוּ א֨וֹר פָּנֶ֬יךָ יְהֹוָֽה**

A new voice intrudes: **רַבִּים אֹמְרִים** (rabbim 'omrim, "many are saying"). The identity of these **רַבִּים** (rabbim, "many") determines interpretation. Are they the same **בְּנֵי אִישׁ** (benei 'ish, "sons of man") from verse 3—the adversaries now quoted directly? Or are they the broader community, voicing legitimate despair in hard times? The question **מִי־יַרְאֵנוּ טוֹב** (mi yar'enu tov, "Who will show us good?") appears elsewhere as existential complaint. Job 21:16 asks skeptically, **עֲצַת רְשָׁעִים רָחֲקָה מֶנִּי** ('atzat resha'im rachakah menni, "the counsel of the wicked is far from me"), implying that the wicked prosper while the righteous suffer. Lamentations 3:17 laments, **וַתִּזְנַח מִשָּׁלוֹם נַפְשִׁי נָשִׁיתִי טוֹבָה** (va-tiznach mi-shalom nafshi nashiti tovah, "You have removed peace from my soul; I have forgotten what good is").

The ambiguity enriches interpretation. If these are adversaries, their question is cynical: "Who can show us benefit [from following you]?" The implied answer: Absalom's rebellion promises tangible advantage; David's cause offers only hardship. But if these are the fearful faithful, their question reflects honest anxiety amid drought, war, or social collapse: "Who will provide relief?" This reading gains traction from what follows: **נְסָה־עָלֵינוּ אוֹר פָּנֶיךָ יְהוָה** (nesah 'aleinu 'or panekha Adonai, "Lift upon us the light of Your face, O YHWH"). This is liturgical language, not rebel taunting.

The phrase **נְסָה־עָלֵינוּ אוֹר פָּנֶיךָ** (nesah 'aleinu 'or panekha) directly echoes the Aaronic blessing of Numbers 6:25-26: **יָאֵר יְהוָה פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ וִיחֻנֶּךָּ** (ya'er Adonai panav 'elekha vichunneka, "May YHWH make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you"). The verb **נָסָה** (nasah) here is debated. Ibn Ezra and Radak derive it from **נ.ש.א** (n.sh.'), "to lift up," citing Isaiah 49:22: **אָרִים אֶל־גּוֹיִם נִסִּי** ('arim 'el goyim nissi, "I will lift up my standard/banner to the nations"). The **ה** (he) and **א** (alef) interchange in this root (compare **הֵרִים נֵס** / herim nes, "lift up a banner," Isaiah 62:10). Others suggest **נ.צ.ח** (n.ts.ch), the "conduct" root from verse 1, but this requires forced etymology.

The key theological content is **אוֹר פָּנֶיךָ** ('or panekha, "the light of Your face"), a metaphor for divine favor pervading the Psalter. Psalm 44:4 declares: **כִּי לֹא בְחַרְבָּם יָרְשׁוּ אָרֶץ וּזְרוֹעָם לֹא־הוֹשִׁיעָה לָּמוֹ כִּי־יְמִינְךָ וּזְרוֹעֲךָ וְאוֹר פָּנֶיךָ כִּי רְצִיתָם** (ki lo' ve-charbam yarshu 'aretz u-zero'am lo'-hoshi'ah lamo ki yeminekha u-zero'akha ve-'or panekha ki retzitam, "It was not by their sword that they took the land, nor did their arm give them victory, but Your right hand, Your arm, and the light of Your face, for You favored them"). The "shining face" signifies presence, approval, and active intervention—the opposite of **הַסְתֵּר פָּנִים** (haster panim, "hiding of face"), God's terrifying absence (Deuteronomy 31:17-18). The "many" thus pray for visible, tangible divine favor—not merely internal peace but external transformation: rain, harvest, victory, national restoration.

Radak interprets these "many" as the **גְּדוֹלֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל שֶׁהָיוּ עִם אַבְשָׁלוֹם** (gedolei Yisra'el she-hayu 'im Avshalom, "great ones of Israel who were with Absalom"), voicing their longing for success in rebellion. But Meiri suggests a more sympathetic reading: they are asking, amid national calamity, **שֶׁתָּאִיר אֲפֵלָתֵנוּ** (she-ta'ir 'afelatenu, "that You illuminate our darkness")—a cry for deliverance, not a cynical taunt. This ambiguity sets up the psalm's central contrast.

## Verse 8

**נָתַ֣תָּה שִׂמְחָ֣ה בְלִבִּ֑י מֵעֵ֬ת דְּגָנָ֖ם וְתִירוֹשָׁ֣ם רָֽבּוּ**

The psalm's theological heart beats in this verse, presenting its central claim: **נָתַתָּה שִׂמְחָה בְלִבִּי** (natattah simchah ve-libbi, "You have put joy in my heart"). The perfect verb **נָתַתָּה** (natattah, "you gave/put") can denote completed action or, more likely here, habitual/gnomic truth: "You [characteristically] give." The subject is God; the direct object is **שִׂמְחָה** (simchah, "joy, gladness"); the indirect object/location is **בְלִבִּי** (ve-libbi, "in my heart"). Joy is thus a divine *gift* placed directly into the core of the self—not produced by circumstances but *implanted* by God independent of external conditions.

The interpretive crux lies in the temporal clause: **מֵעֵת דְּגָנָם וְתִירוֹשָׁם רָבּוּ** (me-'et deganam ve-tirosham ravu). The particle **מֵעֵת** (me-'et) governs multiple possible meanings: (1) temporal—"at the time when"; (2) comparative—"more than when"; (3) causal—"because." Each generates a different theological claim.

If *temporal* ("at the time when their grain and wine multiplied"), the psalmist testifies to joy *simultaneous* with others' prosperity. This implies contentment while observing neighbors' blessing—a remarkable freedom from envy. Radak affirms this reading: **אֲנִי הָיְתָה לִי שִׂמְחָה בְלִבִּי בְּטוֹבָתָם... וְהֵם שְׂמֵחִים לְרָעָתִי** ('ani hayetah li simchah be-libbi be-tovatam... ve-hem semechim le-ra'ati, "I had joy in my heart at their prosperity... but they rejoice at my evil"). The speaker practices what Proverbs 24:17 prohibits in negative: **בִּנְפֹל אוֹיִבְךָ אַל־תִּשְׂמָח** (bi-nefol 'oyivkha 'al tismach, "Do not rejoice when your enemy falls")—here positively: *Do* rejoice when your enemy prospers. This is spiritual virtuosity, requiring grace to celebrate the success of those who wish you harm.

If *comparative* ("more than when their grain and wine multiplied"), the claim intensifies: God-given joy *exceeds* material prosperity. This reading requires understanding the possessive suffix **דְּגָנָם** (deganam, "*their* grain") as contrasting "their abundance" with "my sufficiency." The psalmist lacks what they have yet possesses superior joy. This interpretation dominates Christian reception (Augustine: "Thou hast given gladness in my heart, from the time of their corn and wine being multiplied"—the "from" implying "more than"). Metzudat David captures this: **אַתָּה ה' נָתַתָּ בְלִבִּי לִהְיוֹת שָׂמֵחַ בְּחֶלְקִי יוֹתֵר מֵהָרַבִּים הָהֵם הַשְּׂמֵחִים מֵעֵת שֶׁרָבּוּ דְּגָנָם וְתִירוֹשָׁם** ('attah Adonai natatta ve-libbi lihyot same'ach be-chelki yoter me-ha-rabbim ha-hem ha-semechim me-'et she-rabbu deganam ve-tirosham, "You, O YHWH, gave [the disposition] in my heart to be joyful with my portion more than those many who rejoice from the time their grain and wine multiplied").

If *causal* ("because their grain and wine multiplied"), the speaker rejoices *in others' success*—vicarious joy without possessing the blessing oneself. This reading, though grammatically possible, requires exceptional generosity: "I am glad *because* you prosper, even though I don't." Ibn Ezra dismisses this, insisting the meaning is simply: **כִּי אַתָּה נָתַתָּה לִי לֵב טוֹב לְהִתְאַוֹּת טוֹב לַכֹּל** (ki 'attah natattah li lev tov le-hit'avvot tov la-khol, "for You gave me a good heart to desire good for everyone")—not rejoicing *because* of their prosperity but rejoicing *for* them despite personal lack.

The terms **דָּגָן** (dagan, "grain") and **תִּירוֹשׁ** (tirosh, "new wine") form a standard biblical merism representing total agricultural blessing. Deuteronomy 7:13 promises the covenant faithful: **וְאָהֵבְךָ וּבֵרַכְךָ וְהִרְבֶּךָ וּבֵרַךְ פְּרִי־בִטְנְךָ וּפְרִי־אַדְמָתֶךָ דְּגָנְךָ וְתִירֹשְׁךָ וְיִצְהָרֶךָ** (ve-'ahevkha u-verakhkha ve-hirbbekha u-verakh peri-vitnekha u-feri 'admatekha deganekha ve-tiroshkha ve-yitzharekha, "He will love you, bless you, and multiply you; He will bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your ground, your grain, your wine, and your oil"). This is *visible* covenant blessing—tangible proof God favors His people. The possessive **דְּגָנָם וְתִירוֹשָׁם** (deganam ve-tirosham, "*their* grain and wine") signals that the speaker observes this blessing *from outside*—they possess it; he does not.

Malbim, following his historical reconstruction, identifies the context as the three-year famine in David's reign (2 Samuel 21:1). The "many" blamed David's sin for the drought; when rain returned, David's **שִׂמְחָה** (simchah, "joy") derived not from material abundance but from vindication: **מֵעֵת שֶׁהִתְחִילוּ לְהַרְבּוֹת דְּגָנָם וְתִירוֹשָׁם כְּשֶׁנִּפְסַק הָרָעָב** (me-'et she-hitchilu le-harbbot deganam ve-tirosham ke-she-nifsak ha-ra'av, "from the time they began to multiply their grain and wine when the famine ceased")—proving his righteousness (**צֶדֶק** / tzedek, v. 2) publicly. The psalm's opening epithet **אֱלֹהֵי צִדְקִי** ('elohei tzidki, "God of my vindication," v. 2) finds fulfillment: the famine's end demonstrates God's approval of David despite accusations.

The verse thus stages the psalm's central opposition: two ways of seeking **טוֹב** (tov, "good," v. 7). One locates it in visible prosperity (**דָּגָן וְתִירוֹשׁ** / dagan ve-tirosh); the other receives it as internal gift (**שִׂמְחָה בְלִבִּי** / simchah be-libbi). Neither path condemns the other—agricultural blessing is legitimate covenant promise—but one proves more reliable when circumstances shift. As Radak notes, the speaker's **דֶּרֶךְ טוֹבָה** (derekh tovah, "good way") of rejoicing in others' prosperity aligns him with God: **וְהַהוֹלֵךְ דֶּרֶךְ טוֹבָה הָאֵל מְסַיְּעוֹ וּמַדְרִיכוֹ** (ve-ha-holekh derekh tovah ha-'El mesayye'o u-madrikho, "and one who walks in the good way, God assists him and guides him").

## Verse 9

**בְּשָׁל֣וֹם יַחְדָּ֣ו אֶשְׁכְּבָ֣ה וְאִישָׁ֑ן כִּֽי־אַתָּ֥ה יְהֹוָ֗ה לְבָדָ֥ד לָבֶ֥טַח תּוֹשִׁיבֵֽנִי**

The psalm's evening frame, begun in verse 5 (**עַל־מִשְׁכַּבְכֶם** / 'al mishkavkhem, "upon your beds"), now closes with confident testimony of secure rest. The verse employs a triple structure: two cohortative verbs (**אֶשְׁכְּבָה וְאִישָׁן** / 'eshkevah ve-'ishan, "I will lie down and sleep") followed by causal clause (**כִּי־אַתָּה** / ki 'attah, "for You..."). But the opening phrase **בְּשָׁלוֹם יַחְדָּו** (be-shalom yachdav, "in peace together") requires careful parsing.

The adverb **יַחְדָּו** (yachdav, "together") can mean: (1) spatial togetherness—"with others"; (2) temporal simultaneity—"at once"; (3) integrated wholeness—"in unity." The spatial reading faces difficulty: together with *whom*? Rashi suggests: **אִם הָיוּ יִשְׂרָאֵל בְּשָׁלוֹם יַחְדָּו עִמִּי הָיִיתִי שׁוֹכֵב וְיָשֵׁן בֶּטַח** (im hayu Yisra'el be-shalom yachdav 'immi hayiti shokhev ve-yashen betach, "If Israel were in peace together with me, I would lie down and sleep in confidence"). But this conditional grammar is foreign to the verse's assertive tone. Ibn Ezra proposes: **הָרַבִּים וְהוּא עִמָּהֶם** (ha-rabbim ve-hu' 'immahem, "the many [his followers] and he with them")—David surrounded by loyal troops. Yet no military entourage appears in context.

The temporal reading—"at once, immediately"—suits the syntax better. Metzudat David explains: **מִבְּלִי פַחַד אֶשְׁכְּבָה וְאִישָׁן יַחְדָּיו תְּכוּפִים זֶה לָזֶה כִּי הַדּוֹאֵג וּמִתְפַּחֵד נִגְזֶלֶת שְׁנָתוֹ לְבַל יוּכְלוּ לִישֹׁן מִיָּד** (mi-beli pachad 'eshkevah ve-'ishan yachdav tekufim zeh la-zeh ki ha-do'eg u-mitpached nigzelet shenato le-val yukhelu lishan mi-yad, "Without fear I will lie down and sleep together, continuously one after the other, for the anxious and frightened have their sleep stolen so they cannot sleep immediately"). The anxious lie awake; the trusting sleep comes instantly. Psalm 3:6 provides parallel: **אֲנִי שָׁכַבְתִּי וָאִישָׁנָה הֱקִיצוֹתִי כִּי יְהוָה יִסְמְכֵנִי** ('ani shakhavti va-'ishanah hekitzoti ki Adonai yismekheni, "I lie down and sleep; I wake again, for YHWH sustains me"). The sequence—lie down, sleep, wake—indicates unbroken rest without nocturnal anxiety.

The preposition **בְּשָׁלוֹם** (be-shalom, "in peace") modifies both verbs, signaling the *quality* of rest, not merely its occurrence. The noun **שָׁלוֹם** (shalom, "peace, wholeness, well-being") encompasses physical safety, social harmony, and psychological tranquility. Job 11:18-19 contrasts the wicked and righteous: **וּבָטַחְתָּ כִּי־יֵשׁ תִּקְוָה... וְשָׁכַבְתָּ וְאֵין מַחֲרִיד** (u-vatachta ki yesh tikvah... ve-shakhavta ve-'ein macharid, "You will be secure, because there is hope... you will lie down with none to disturb"). The absence of **מַחֲרִיד** (macharid, "one who terrifies") defines **שָׁלוֹם** (shalom) here—no external threat, no internal dread.

The causal clause grounds this confidence: **כִּי־אַתָּה יְהוָה לְבָדָד לָבֶטַח תּוֹשִׁיבֵנִי** (ki 'attah Adonai levadad lavetach toshiveni, "for You, YHWH, alone make me dwell in safety"). Three elements demand attention: the emphatic pronoun **אַתָּה** ('attah, "You"), the adverb **לְבָדָד** (levadad, "alone"), and the verb **תּוֹשִׁיבֵנִי** (toshiveni, "You make me dwell").

The emphatic **אַתָּה** ('attah) positions YHWH as sole agent—not circumstances, not military strength, not political alliances. This echoes Deuteronomy 32:12: **יְהוָה בָּדָד יַנְחֶנּוּ וְאֵין עִמּוֹ אֵל נֵכָר** (Adonai badad yanchennu ve-'ein 'immo 'el nekhar, "YHWH alone guided him, no foreign god was with him"). The parallel is instructive: Israel's wilderness wandering required absolute dependence on YHWH when no human resource sufficed. Similarly here, the speaker testifies to radical theological monergism—**יְהוָה לְבָדָד** (Adonai levadad, "YHWH alone") effects security.

The adverb **לְבָדָד** (levadad, "alone") is emphatic and polyvalent. It can modify the preceding subject: "You, YHWH, *alone*" (not YHWH plus prosperity, plus military, plus political favor). Or it can modify the following verb: "make me dwell *alone*" (solitary, isolated from allies). Or it functions adverbially: "securely/entirely" (BDB: "alone = in safety"). Radak disambiguates: **אַתָּה ה' לְבַדְּךָ תַּעֲשֶׂה זֶה וּבְךָ בִּטְחוֹנִי וְלֹא בְאַחֵר** ('attah Adonai levaddekha ta'aseh zeh u-vekha bitchoni ve-lo' ve-'acher, "You, YHWH, *alone* will do this, and in You is my trust, not in another"). The theological claim is sufficiency: YHWH needs no supplementation.

The verb **תּוֹשִׁיבֵנִי** (toshiveni, Hiphil imperfect of **י.ש.ב** / y.sh.v) means "You make me dwell/sit/remain." This causative stem indicates God as active agent, not merely passive permission. The root **י.ש.ב** (y.sh.v, "dwell, sit, remain") appears in Deuteronomy 33:28's blessing: **וַיִּשְׁכֹּן יִשְׂרָאֵל בֶּטַח בָּדָד עֵין יַעֲקֹב אֶל־אֶרֶץ דָּגָן וְתִירוֹשׁ אַף־שָׁמָיו יַעַרְפוּ טָל** (va-yishkon Yisra'el betach badad 'ein Ya'akov 'el 'eretz dagan ve-tirosh 'af shamav ya'arfu tal, "Israel dwells in safety, alone, the fountain of Jacob, in a land of grain and wine; his heavens also drop down dew"). Malbim seizes this allusion: **תָּפַס הַמְּלִיצָה מִמַּה שֶּׁנֶּאֱמַר וַיִּשְׁכֹּן יִשְׂרָאֵל בֶּטַח בָּדָד עֵין יַעֲקֹב אֶל אֶרֶץ דָּגָן וְתִירוֹשׁ** (tafas ha-melitzah mi-mah she-ne'emar va-yishkon Yisra'el betach badad 'ein Ya'akov 'el 'eretz dagan ve-tirosh, "He seized the metaphor from what is said: 'Israel dwells in safety, alone, the fountain of Jacob, in a land of grain and wine'"). The phrase **אֶל אֶרֶץ דָּגָן וְתִירוֹשׁ** ('el 'eretz dagan ve-tirosh, "in a land of grain and wine") connects verse 9's security with verse 8's agricultural reference—but here the blessing is *presence*, not produce. Israel dwells safely **בָּדָד** (badad, "alone") not because of **דָּגָן וְתִירוֹשׁ** (dagan ve-tirosh, "grain and wine") but because of YHWH's singular sufficiency: **אַחַר שֶׁנִּמְצָא טַל וְדָגָן וְתִירוֹשׁ יִשְׁכּוֹן יִשְׂרָאֵל בֶּטַח בָּדָד שֶׁאֵין צָרִיךְ לִקְנוֹת תְּבוּאָה מֵאֲרָצוֹת אֲחֵרוֹת** ('achar she-nimtza' tal ve-dagan ve-tirosh yishkon Yisra'el betach badad she-'ein tzarikh liknot tevu'ah me-'aratzot 'acherot, "After dew and grain and wine are found, Israel dwells securely alone because there is no need to purchase produce from other lands")—self-sufficiency rooted in divine provision, not autonomous resource management.

The noun **לָבֶטַח** (lavetach, "in safety") appears 42 times in Scripture, frequently with **י.ש.ב** (y.sh.v, "dwell"): Leviticus 25:18-19 promises covenant obedience yields **וִישַׁבְתֶּם עַל־הָאָרֶץ לָבֶטַח** (vi-shavtem 'al ha-'aretz lavetach, "you shall dwell in the land in safety"). Psalm 16:9 parallels Psalm 4:9 precisely: **לָכֵן שָׂמַח לִבִּי וַיָּגֶל כְּבוֹדִי אַף־בְּשָׂרִי יִשְׁכֹּן לָבֶטַח** (lakhen samach libbi va-yagel kevodi 'af besari yishkon lavetach, "Therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices; my flesh also dwells in safety"). The conjunction of **שִׂמְחָה** (simchah, "joy," v. 8) and **לָבֶטַח** (lavetach, "safety," v. 9) forges the psalm's theological payoff: joy in the heart (v. 8) *produces* security in the body (v. 9). This reverses typical causality—external safety usually precedes internal peace. Here, God-given inner joy *generates* external security because the ultimate threat (divine disfavor) is removed. The speaker can sleep not because circumstances guarantee safety but because trust renders circumstance irrelevant.

The evening setting thus completes the psalm's liturgical arc. Verse 5 instructed adversaries: **אִמְרוּ בִלְבַבְכֶם עַל־מִשְׁכַּבְכֶם וְדֹמּוּ** (imru vi-levavkhem 'al mishkavkhem ve-dommu, "Speak in your hearts upon your beds and be silent"). Verse 9 models the outcome: silence achieved through trust, producing rest. The Talmud's liturgical appropriation (Berakhot 4b) made this verse the paradigm of bedtime trust—Rabbi Joshua ben Levi ruling that one must recite Shema before sleep based on **עַל־מִשְׁכַּבְכֶם** ('al mishkavkhem). What began as instruction to enemies became prescription for disciples: the adversaries' commanded silence transformed into the pious's cultivated trust. The psalm's final word, **תּוֹשִׁיבֵנִי** (toshiveni, "You make me dwell"), is imperfect—not past completed action but ongoing habitual reality. Every night replicates this trust; every morning proves YHWH's faithfulness. The psalm's *performance* thus enacts its *theology*: testifying to security by lying down confident that morning will come.
