The term 'בְּבׇרְח֗וֹ' (when he fled) is unusual - typically superscriptions use simpler constructions. The LXX uses 'ὁπότε ἀποδιδράσκω' (when fleeing), present tense, making it more immediate/ongoing.",

    "What is the precise meaning of 'מָגֵן בַּעֲדִי' (shield around me) - is בַּעֲדִי spatial (encircling) or relational (on behalf of), and does it deliberately answer סָבִיב (surrounding) in v7?",
    "How should we interpret the perfect verbs in v8 ('You struck... You broke') - are these prophetic perfects (certain future), precative perfects (wishes), or recollections of past pattern, and what does each reading contribute to the psalm's rhetoric?",
    "What is the theological significance of the spatial paradox in v5 where God answers 'from His holy mountain' when the superscription depicts David fleeing FROM Jerusalem - does this reflect temple theology of divine presence transcending geography?",
    "Why does the psalm escalate numerical odds from 'many' (רבים) to 'myriads' (רִבְבוֹת) precisely when confidence peaks (v7) - what rhetorical or theological function does this paradoxical movement serve?",
    "Is the sleep sequence in v6 (lay down → slept → awoke) meant literally or metaphorically, and why use three verbs rather than simply 'I slept' - does the triadic structure carry theological weight about trust/vulnerability/resurrection?",
    "What does 'breaking teeth' (v8) signify in Ancient Near Eastern context - physical combat disarmament, silencing verbal mockery, judicial curse fulfillment, or all three?",
    "Why does v9 shift from first-person lament to third-person statement about 'Your people' - is this evidence of liturgical adaptation from personal to communal use, or does it serve rhetorical function within original composition?",
    "How does the LXX's addition of 'ματαίως' (in vain) in v8 affect interpretation - is this interpretive expansion suggesting enemies' attacks are futile, or translation of implied Hebrew element?",
    "What is the function of the nominal sentence structure in v9 ('To-YHWH [belongs] the-deliverance') - does the verbless construction emphasize ontological claim about God's nature rather than merely his actions?",
    "Why does the psalmist use Elohim (generic 'God') only in v3 (enemies' taunt) and v8 (petition), but YHWH everywhere else - what does divine name alternation reveal about relationship, theology, or rhetorical strategy?"
