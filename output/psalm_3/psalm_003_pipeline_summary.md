## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (11)

1. What is the theological and rhetorical significance of the fourfold repetition of רבב (many) in vv. 2-3, and does it connect to Ancient Near Eastern numerical symbolism or military contexts?
2. How does the body imagery progression (shield—head—face—teeth) function as a conceptual map of protection, honor, judgment, and disarmament? Are there Ugaritic or ANE parallels to this imagery sequence?
3. What is the spatial theology of 'holy mountain' (v. 5) when the superscription depicts David fleeing FROM Jerusalem? How do other Zion psalms handle God's presence beyond temple geography?
4. Are the perfect verb forms in v. 8 ('You struck... You broke') prophetic perfects (certain future), precative perfects (expressing wish), or recollection of past divine pattern? How does each reading affect the psalm's rhetoric?
5. What is the significance of sleep (v. 6) as a trust motif in the Psalter? How does Ps 3:6 relate to Ps 4:8, 127:2, and the broader biblical theology of rest?
6. What is the syntactic function of לו ('for him' or 'to him') in v. 3—are enemies speaking TO the psalmist (direct taunt) or ABOUT him (third-person mockery)? How does LXX interpret this?
7. How does 'breaking teeth' (v. 8) function in ANE warfare, curse, and legal contexts? Is this about physical combat, judicial disarmament, or silencing verbal opponents?
8. What is the relationship between v. 9's universal conclusion ('Your people') and the individual focus of vv. 2-8? Is this evidence of liturgical adaptation from personal to communal use?
9. How do the three Selah markers structure the psalm liturgically? Do they indicate congregational response, musical interlude, or contemplative pause?
10. What is the theological force of God as 'shield AROUND me' (בעדי, v. 4) versus God as shield more generally? Does this image respond specifically to enemies 'surrounding' (סביב, v. 7)?
11. How does the face-striking imagery (לחי, 'cheek/jaw,' v. 8) function as judicial humiliation versus combat violence? Compare to ancient legal texts and prophetic usage.

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (11)

1. Why does v3 use the construction 'אֹמְרִים לְנַפְשִׁי' (saying to my soul) rather than typical 'about me' - what's the rhetorical force of enemies addressing the psalmist's נֶפֶשׁ directly?
2. What is the precise meaning of 'מָגֵן בַּעֲדִי' (shield around me) - is בַּעֲדִי spatial (encircling) or relational (on behalf of), and does it deliberately answer סָבִיב (surrounding) in v7?
3. How should we interpret the perfect verbs in v8 ('You struck... You broke') - are these prophetic perfects (certain future), precative perfects (wishes), or recollections of past pattern, and what does each reading contribute to the psalm's rhetoric?
4. What is the theological significance of the spatial paradox in v5 where God answers 'from His holy mountain' when the superscription depicts David fleeing FROM Jerusalem - does this reflect temple theology of divine presence transcending geography?
5. Why does the psalm escalate numerical odds from 'many' (רבים) to 'myriads' (רִבְבוֹת) precisely when confidence peaks (v7) - what rhetorical or theological function does this paradoxical movement serve?
6. Is the sleep sequence in v6 (lay down → slept → awoke) meant literally or metaphorically, and why use three verbs rather than simply 'I slept' - does the triadic structure carry theological weight about trust/vulnerability/resurrection?
7. What does 'breaking teeth' (v8) signify in Ancient Near Eastern context - physical combat disarmament, silencing verbal mockery, judicial curse fulfillment, or all three?
8. Why does v9 shift from first-person lament to third-person statement about 'Your people' - is this evidence of liturgical adaptation from personal to communal use, or does it serve rhetorical function within original composition?
9. How does the LXX's addition of 'ματαίως' (in vain) in v8 affect interpretation - is this interpretive expansion suggesting enemies' attacks are futile, or translation of implied Hebrew element?
10. What is the function of the nominal sentence structure in v9 ('To-YHWH [belongs] the-deliverance') - does the verbless construction emphasize ontological claim about God's nature rather than merely his actions?
11. Why does the psalmist use Elohim (generic 'God') only in v3 (enemies' taunt) and v8 (petition), but YHWH everywhere else - what does divine name alternation reveal about relationship, theology, or rhetorical strategy?
