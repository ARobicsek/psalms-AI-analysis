# Verse-by-Verse Commentary: Psalm 3

## Verse 1

**מִזְמ֥וֹר לְדָוִ֑ד בְּ֝בׇרְח֗וֹ מִפְּנֵ֤י ׀ אַבְשָׁל֬וֹם בְּנֽוֹ׃**

*A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.*

The superscription (מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד) anchors this composition in one of David's darkest hours—the moment when his own son led a rebellion against him, forcing the king to flee Jerusalem barefoot and weeping up the Mount of Olives (2 Samuel 15:30). Yet the Hebrew term מִזְמוֹר, "psalm" or "song," creates an immediate tension: why designate this a *song* when the narrative context depicts profound tragedy? The Babylonian Talmud (Berakhot 7b) addresses this paradox directly, explaining that when the prophet Nathan had earlier warned David, "Behold, I will raise up against you evil out of your own house" (2 Samuel 12:11), David feared the rebellion might come from "a slave or a *mamzer* [child of an illicit union] who will not show me mercy." When David discovered the threat came from his own son Absalom, he rejoiced—not at the rebellion itself, but at the prospect that his son might yet show him compassion. Hence: *mizmor*, a song of relief amid disaster.

The temporal construction בְּבׇרְחוֹ מִפְּנֵי uses the infinitive construct בְּבׇרְח֗וֹ (from the root ב־ר־ח, "to flee") with the preposition מִפְּנֵי ("from before/from the face of"), creating a precise historical marker. This is one of only thirteen psalms bearing such narrative superscriptions, linking the liturgical text to a specific moment in Israel's history. The Radak notes that David composed this psalm "as he ascended the Mount of Olives" (2 Samuel 15:30), meaning the prayer emerged *during* the crisis, not after. This temporal immediacy transforms the psalm from retrospective reflection into real-time theodicy—a father's prayer while still running from his child.

The phrase אַבְשָׁל֬וֹם בְּנֽוֹ ("Absalom his son") places the familial relationship in stark relief. The possessive suffix on בְּנֽוֹ ("his son") emphasizes the betrayal's intimate nature, making this not merely a political rebellion but a rupture in the most fundamental human bond. This context of father-son betrayal will color every subsequent verse, particularly the declarations of trust in God as shield and protector (v. 4)—the son who should defend his father has become the threat from which the Father in heaven must defend.

## Verse 2

**יְהֹוָ֗ה מָֽה־רַבּ֥וּ צָרָ֑י רַ֝בִּ֗ים קָמִ֥ים עָלָֽי׃**

*O LORD, how many are my foes! Many are those who attack me.*

The verse opens with a fourfold assault of the root רבב (r-b-b, "to be many/numerous"). First, the interrogative exclamation מָֽה־רַבּ֥וּ (mah-ra-BU)—literally "what are they many" or "how numerous!"—a rhetorical question expressing astonishment at the overwhelming odds. Ibn Ezra notes that the word מָה in Hebrew can apply to both the sublime (מָה־רַבּוּ מַעֲשֶׂיךָ, "How great are Your works!" Psalm 104:24) and the lowly (מָה אֱנוֹשׁ, "What is man?" Psalm 8:5). Here it marks *temiha*, wonder at the impossible scale of the threat. Then comes רַבִּ֗ים (ra-BIM, "many") twice in succession, creating anaphoric intensification—not merely "many enemies" but "many...many" in Hebrew word order. The effect is cumulative, piling threat upon threat.

The noun צָרָ֑י (tza-RAI, "my foes") derives from צרר (tz-r-r), meaning to bind, constrict, or oppress. These are not merely opponents but *constrictors*, those who hem in and suffocate. Rashi specifies the social breadth of this opposition: "Great men rise up against me—men great in Torah, great in wisdom, great in wealth, tall in stature, such as Saul, the children of Raphah, Doeg, and Ahithophel." The Radak similarly notes that "many of the wise ones of Israel, as Ahithophel and others," had turned against David, interpreting his punishment for the Bathsheba affair as evidence that God had abandoned him. This is not a rabble but Israel's elite—counselors, warriors, and sages—all united against the king.

The participle קָמִ֥ים (ka-MIM, "rising up") adds the dimension of active, ongoing hostility. From the root קום (q-w-m, "to stand, rise"), this form depicts continuous action—"they are rising," "they keep rising"—suggesting an escalating, not static, threat. The military connotation is clear: they are "taking a stand" against him, mustering for battle. The phrase עָלָֽי ("against me") closes the colon with the preposition עַל indicating opposition, completing the circle of encirclement that will become explicit in verse 7.

The phonetic transcription reveals a rhythmic balance: yə-hō-**WĀH** māh-ra-**BŪ** tsā-**RĀY** // ra-**BIY**-m qā-**MIY**-m ʿā-**LĀY**. Each colon contains three primary stresses, creating a 3+3 pattern that mirrors the semantic parallelism. The repetition of the -**AY** sound in tsā-**RĀY** and ʿā-**LĀY** creates an acoustic linkage between "my foes" and "against me," phonetically binding the agent of threat to its direction.

## Verse 3

**רַבִּים֮ אֹמְרִ֢ים לְנַ֫פְשִׁ֥י אֵ֤ין יְֽשׁוּעָ֓תָה לּ֬וֹ בֵאלֹהִ֬ים סֶֽלָה׃**

*Many say of me, "There is no deliverance for him through God." Selah.*

The triple occurrence of the root רבב reaches its climax here with רַבִּים (ra-BIM), the third and final use in as many verses, creating an overwhelming rhetorical crescendo of numerical impossibility. But now the threat shifts from physical to theological: the enemies are not merely attacking with weapons but with words—specifically, with a devastating theological verdict: אֵין יְֽשׁוּעָ֓תָה לּ֬וֹ בֵאלֹהִ֬ים ("There is no deliverance for him through God").

The syntactic puzzle of לְנַ֫פְשִׁ֥י (le-naf-SHI, "to my soul" or "concerning me") has generated extensive commentary. The preposition לְ can mean either "to" (direct address) or "about/concerning" (indirect). Are the enemies taunting David directly, saying "to your soul" (i.e., to you personally), or speaking *about* him in third person, "concerning his soul"? The Radak argues for the latter, citing parallels like "Pharaoh will say concerning (לְ) the children of Israel" (Exodus 14:3). The third-person mockery may be more cutting than direct address—they don't even grant David the dignity of confrontation but discuss his theological abandonment as settled fact.

The enemy's taunt itself is theologically loaded. The noun יְֽשׁוּעָ֓תָה (ye-shu-'A-tah, "his deliverance") bears an unusual feminine suffix ה- that Ibn Ezra notes draws attention to its formal construction. More crucially, the prepositional phrase בֵאלֹהִ֬ים (ve-lo-HIM, "through God" or "in God") suggests not mere divine absence but divine *impotence*. The preposition ב can indicate instrumentality ("by means of") or location ("in"); either way, the claim is that God is not merely unwilling but *unable* to act on David's behalf. Moreover, they use the generic divine name אֱלֹהִים (Elohim) rather than the covenant name יהוה (YHWH), treating God as an abstract, distant force rather than Israel's covenant partner—a subtle theological distancing that the psalm will dramatically reverse in the very next verse.

The Radak provides the historical context for this theological judgment: "Many of the wise ones of Israel, as Ahithophel and others, were of opinion that this punishment came to him on account of the affair of Bathsheba, as was actually the case. And they were also of opinion that kingship would never return to him forever; therefore they went after Absalom and rebelled against him, and they were saying that he has no portion in the world to come; therefore he said 'concerning my soul.'" The enemies' taunt is not merely political propaganda but represents a sophisticated theological reading of David's downfall—the scholarly consensus that his adultery and murder have severed him from divine grace.

The verse closes with סֶֽלָה (SE-lah), the first of three liturgical markers in this psalm. While the precise meaning of *selah* remains debated, it likely indicates a musical interlude or pause, dividing the composition into stanzas. Here it creates a dramatic caesura after the enemies' devastating pronouncement, allowing the theological challenge to hang in the air before David's response in verse 4. The Torah Temimah notes that this verse establishes the hermeneutical principle that "evil speech (lashon hara) against a person is considered equivalent to attacking their very life" (see BT Berakhot 7b)—the enemies' words are not merely offensive but existentially threatening.

## Verse 4

**וְאַתָּ֣ה יְ֭הֹוָה מָגֵ֣ן בַּעֲדִ֑י כְּ֝בוֹדִ֗י וּמֵרִ֥ים רֹאשִֽׁי׃**

*But You, O LORD, are a shield about me, my glory, He who holds my head high.*

The pivotal adversative וְאַתָּה (ve-'a-TAH, "But You") introduces the sharpest possible reversal in the psalm. This emphatic independent pronoun—*You*, in contrast to what *they* say—launches a direct rebuttal to the enemies' theological verdict. The shift from the generic אֱלֹהִים (Elohim) of the enemies' taunt to the intimate covenant name יְהֹוָה (YHWH, Adonai) is theologically loaded: David moves from the abstract divine concept his enemies invoke to the specific God of Israel who has a personal, covenantal relationship with the king.

The triple identification of God that follows uses concrete, embodied imagery. First: מָגֵ֣ן בַּעֲדִ֑י (ma-GEN ba-'a-DI, "a shield about me"). The noun מָגֵן typically means a defensive shield, but here the preposition בַּעֲדִי (from the root ב־ע־ד, "around, about, on behalf of") is crucial. This is not merely a shield held in the hand for protection from one direction, but a shield that *encircles*—an encompassing protective presence. The figurative language database reveals that God-as-shield appears 15 times in Psalms alone, predominantly in contexts of trust amid military threat (Genesis 15:1, Psalm 18:3, 28:7). But the specific formulation מָגֵ֣ן בַּעֲדִ֑י, with its spatial preposition suggesting complete encirclement, is unique to this verse. This directly answers the enemies' סָבִיב שָׁתוּ עָלַי ("they have set themselves around against me") in verse 7—two competing encirclements, hostile versus protective. The Radak notes: "They think and say so; but You will deal with me in the very opposite way and will be a shield about me to deliver me in this world and a shield about me in the world to come."

Second: כְּבוֹדִ֗י (khe-vo-DI, "my glory"). This noun from the root כבד (k-b-d, meaning "weight, heaviness, honor") creates a syntactic puzzle that has generated extensive commentary. Is God *himself* David's glory (apposition), or does God *restore* David's honor (causation)? The Metzudat David reads it as restoration: "You are the one who upholds my honor" (תּוֹמֵךְ כְּבוֹדִי). Ibn Ezra suggests: "The meaning of 'my glory' is that every victor has glory," implying that God's victory grants David honor. The Radak offers both options: "The 'glory' is the soul, as 'and my glory rejoiced' (Psalm 16:9); 'that glory may sing praise' (Psalm 30:13). Or, the interpretation of 'my glory': the opposite of the disgrace he had in fleeing." Either way—whether God *is* David's honor or God *gives* him honor—the claim is audacious: against accusations of divine abandonment, David asserts that YHWH constitutes his very dignity. The term כָּבוֹד appears 200 times in the Hebrew Bible, often denoting God's own glory (the *kavod* that fills the tabernacle); David's use of it with a possessive suffix (כְּבוֹדִי, "*my* glory") is striking, almost claiming participation in the divine *kavod* itself.

Third: וּמֵרִ֥ים רֹאשִֽׁי (u-me-RIM ro-SHI, "and the one who lifts my head"). The Hiphil participle מֵרִים (from the root רום, r-w-m, "to be high, exalted") indicates causative action—God actively *causes* David's head to rise. The idiom of lifting one's head (הֵרִים רֹאשׁ) appears throughout Scripture as a gesture of restored dignity and honor, reversing the posture of shame (compare Psalm 110:7, "Therefore he holds his head high"). In contrast to the imagery of striking the cheek (לֶחִי) and breaking teeth (שִׁנֵּי) in verse 8—which humiliate and disable the enemy—lifting the head restores full personhood and social standing. The figurative language database shows only one instance of this specific "lift head" metaphor (Psalm 110:7), making it a relatively rare biblical image. David here reverses the choreography of defeat: the king who fled barefoot and weeping (2 Samuel 15:30) now has his head held high by divine intervention.

The body imagery progression in this verse—shield (protection), glory (honor), raised head (dignity)—maps a conceptual journey from defense to social restoration. The Malbim notes: "He responds to those rising up against his kingship: 'But You, O LORD, are a shield about me'—this is answered against those who came to destroy his kingship. 'My glory'—this contradicts the shame of his flight. 'And the one who lifts my head'—so I will not be ashamed and my face will not fall before my enemies, but I will lift up my eyes to the mountains from where my help comes." This triadic structure—protection, honor, restored dignity—systematically refutes the enemies' threefold assault in verses 2-3 (numerical, military, theological).

Phonetically, the verse creates a rhythmic ascent: wə-'a-**TĀH** yə-hō-**WĀH** mā-**GHĒN** ba-ʿa-**DHIY** // kə-vō-**DHIY** ū-mē-**RIY**-m rō'-**SHIY**. The first colon places primary stress on **TĀH** (You), **WĀH** (LORD), **GHĒN** (shield), and **DHIY** (about me), creating four beats. The second colon has two stressed syllables: **DHIY** (my glory) and **RIY**-m (lifts), followed by the unstressed rō'-**SHIY** (my head). This 4+2 pattern creates a sense of expansive divine presence (four beats) followed by a swift, definitive action (two beats)—God's broad protection culminating in the specific gesture of raising David's head.

## Verse 5

**ק֭וֹלִי אֶל־יְהֹוָ֣ה אֶקְרָ֑א וַיַּעֲנֵ֨נִי מֵהַ֖ר קׇדְשׁ֣וֹ סֶֽלָה׃**

*I cry aloud to the LORD, and He answers me from His holy mountain. Selah.*

The shift to testimony of past experience grounds present confidence in a pattern of divine response. The fronted קוֹלִי (ko-LI, "my voice") emphasizes vocal prayer—not silent meditation but audible petition. The phrase קוֹלִי אֶל־יְהֹוָה (ko-LI el-YHWH, "my voice to/toward the LORD") uses the directional preposition אֶל, indicating intentional address, the voice aimed like an arrow toward its target. The imperfect verb אֶקְרָא ('eq-RA, "I cry out") denotes durative or repeated action—"I cry," "I keep crying," suggesting ongoing petition rather than a single moment of prayer.

Then comes the pivotal verb וַיַּעֲנֵנִי (vai-ya-'a-NE-ni, "and He answered me"). The Radak identifies the interpretive crux: this perfect verb in past tense could be (1) a true past tense describing prior divine response, establishing a pattern; (2) a "prophetic perfect" where future certainty is narrated as accomplished fact; or (3) a revelation through *ruach hakodesh* (the Holy Spirit), where "the Holy Spirit made a revelation upon his tongue." The Radak favors the third option: "This is the correct [view], for we have already explained that all the psalms were said through the Holy Spirit; and in most prophecy we find that the past tense is used in place of the future, for it is as if the thing has been done once it has been said through the Holy Spirit." This grammatical ambiguity creates temporal compression—the past divine response becomes simultaneously testimony and prophecy, collapsing God's "having answered" with God's "will answer."

The spatial theology of מֵהַר קׇדְשׁוֹ (me-HAR kad-SHO, "from His holy mountain") creates a productive tension with the superscription. According to 2 Samuel 15:30, David has *fled from* Jerusalem, ascending the Mount of Olives in the opposite direction from the city and temple. Yet here David testifies that God answers "from His holy mountain"—clearly referring to Mount Zion, where the ark resided (2 Samuel 6). Ibn Ezra explains: "Because of the Ark that was in Zion, it is called the holy mountain. And this [psalm] precedes the incident involving Araunah the Jebusite [i.e., before the temple site was purchased]." The Malbim develops the point theologically: David "trusted in his heart that God would answer him from afar as from near," demonstrating that "God's presence is not bound to geography."

This geographical paradox—God answering from a place David has physically abandoned—asserts a revolutionary theological claim: divine presence transcends sanctuary geography. The phrase הַר קָדְשׁוֹ ("His holy mountain") appears five times in Psalms (2:6, 3:5, 15:1, 48:2, 99:9), always denoting Zion/Jerusalem as God's dwelling place. Yet here David testifies that God's answering presence follows him into exile. The Radak offers an alternative reading: "We can interpret it as Mount Moriah. And even though it was not yet holy [the temple had not been built], perhaps there was a tradition among them that there would be the house of God in the future." Either way—whether Zion (current sanctuary) or Moriah (future temple site)—the key point is that God's response originates from "His holy mountain" even when David is nowhere near it.

The verse closes with the second סֶֽלָה (SE-lah), marking the end of the testimony section. The liturgical pause allows the congregation to absorb the theological claim: past divine response becomes the ground for present confidence, and divine presence is not confined to sacred precincts but follows the suppliant into the wilderness.

The concordance data reveals that the phrase מֵהַר קָדְשׁוֹ appears verbatim in Psalm 3:5 and in slightly varied forms elsewhere (Psalm 48:2, הַר־קׇדְשׁוֹ; Psalm 99:9, לְהַר קָדְשׁוֹ; Psalm 2:6, הַר־קׇדְשִׁי with first-person suffix; Psalm 15:1, בְּהַר קָדְשֶׁךָ). The consistent association with Zion theology makes this verse's geographical dislocation even more striking—the holy mountain "answers" even when one has fled from it.

Phonetically: qō-**LIY** 'el-yə-hō-**WĀH** 'eq-**RĀ'** // way-ya-ʿa-**NĒ**-niy mē-**HAR** qodh-**SHŌ** **SE**-lāh. The 3+3 stress pattern creates rhythmic balance, with the first colon emphasizing **LIY** (my voice), **WĀH** (LORD), and **RĀ'** (I cry), while the second emphasizes **NĒ** (answered me), **HAR** (mountain), and **SHŌ** (His holiness). The closing sibilant **SE**-lah creates an acoustic fadeout, like an echo from the holy mountain itself.

Modern Jewish liturgy has seized upon this verse's theology of divine accessibility. In the daily *Pesukei Dezimra* (morning praise), verse 5 does not appear in isolation but is integrated into composite liturgical blocks emphasizing salvation themes. More significantly, Psalm 3 in its entirety (verses 2-9) appears in the *Kriat Shema al HaMitah* (Bedtime Shema) across both Ashkenazic and Sefardic traditions, where it functions as protective prayer before sleep—appropriating David's testimony of answered prayer as a template for nightly petition.

## Verse 6

**אֲנִ֥י שָׁכַ֗בְתִּי וָאִ֫ישָׁ֥נָה הֱקִיצ֑וֹתִי כִּ֖י יְהֹוָ֣ה יִסְמְכֵֽנִי׃**

*I lie down and sleep and wake again, for the LORD sustains me.*

This verse contains the psalm's most defiant gesture: the radical act of sleep amid military crisis. The three consecutive perfect verbs—שָׁכַבְתִּי (sha-KHAV-ti, "I lay down"), וָאִישָׁנָה (va-'i-SHA-nah, "and I slept"), הֱקִיצוֹתִי (he-ki-TZO-ti, "I awoke")—narrate a complete sleep cycle with matter-of-fact precision. This is not metaphor or hyperbole but a bodily testimony to trust enacted through vulnerability. Sleep during encirclement should be impossible; military encampments require constant vigilance. The narrative context (2 Samuel 15-17) describes David's flight with his forces, pursued by Absalom's army under Ahithophel's counsel to "strike David while he is weary and weak-handed" (2 Samuel 17:2). In such circumstances, sleep is both physically dangerous and psychologically unthinkable. Yet David testifies: *I lay down. I slept. I woke*.

Rashi interprets this psychologically: "My heart was clogged from worry and fear... I awoke from my worry, because I trusted that the LORD would support me." The image of a "clogged heart" (לִבִּי אָטוּם) suggests emotional paralysis, the numbness of overwhelming dread. Yet this reading undersells the verse's force. The Malbim captures the performative dimension: David "mentions what is narrated [in 2 Samuel 15:24], that when David fled from before Absalom, the priests took with them the ark of the covenant, and the king said to Zadok, 'Return the ark of God to the city; if I find favor in the eyes of the LORD, He will bring me back and show me both it and His dwelling.' For he trusted in his heart that the LORD would answer him from afar as from near." The sleep testimony becomes proof of this trust—not merely stated belief but *embodied* faith.

The verb סָמַךְ (s-m-kh), appearing here in the imperfect יִסְמְכֵֽנִי (yis-me-KHE-ni, "He sustains me"), carries connotations of reliable upholding, of providing physical support that prevents collapse. BDB defines it as "lean, lay, rest, support," noting its use for placing hands on sacrificial victims (Leviticus 1:4) or for God upholding the righteous (Psalm 37:17, 24). The causative aspect is crucial: God actively *causes* David to remain standing, to not fall. The verb appears only three times in Psalms (3:6, 51:14, 145:14), always denoting divine sustenance of the vulnerable. The imperfect tense suggests ongoing action—not "He sustained me once" but "He sustains," "He continues to sustain," making each sleep cycle a renewed demonstration of divine reliability.

The causal כִּי (ki, "for, because") explicitly links the sleep testimony to divine support. The structure is logical: premise (God sustains me), therefore consequence (I can sleep). But the temporal sequence inverts this logic: David has *already* slept, the perfect verbs assert past action, yet the imperfect יִסְמְכֵֽנִי could be present or future. The grammar creates an eternal present—God's sustaining is the timeless ground that makes past sleep possible, present rest secure, and future repose certain. The Radak notes this as prophetic perfect: "For he was confident in this. Or [it is] like its literal sense, for David was confident of this. Or the Holy Spirit made a revelation upon his tongue; and this is the correct [interpretation]."

The figurative language database reveals that sleep as a metaphor for trust or as an idiom for death appears 12 times across Scripture. Psalm 13:4 uses it for death: "lest I sleep the sleep of death" (פֶּן־אִישַׁן הַמָּוֶת). Psalm 4:8 uses it for trust: "I will lie down in peace and sleep, for You, LORD, alone make me dwell in safety." But Psalm 3:6 is distinctive—it's neither metaphorical nor merely wishful. It's a *report* of actual sleep achieved despite objective danger, functioning as testimony to divine protection that has already manifested. The body itself becomes theological argument: if deliverance truly belonged nowhere except to God (as the enemies claim in v. 3), sleep would be impossible. The fact of having slept refutes the enemies' metaphysics.

This verse occupies a pivotal position in Jewish liturgical tradition. The entire psalm appears in the *Kriat Shema al HaMitah* (Bedtime Shema) specifically because verse 6's testimony of sleep amid danger makes it the perfect protective prayer before nightly repose. The tradition grasped the psalm's genius: trust is not primarily cognitive assent but embodied practice. The act of lying down to sleep, when enemies still surround (v. 7), *enacts* the confidence the psalm declares. The Bedtime Shema juxtaposes Psalm 3:6 with Psalm 4:8 ("I will lie down in peace and sleep") and Psalm 91 ("For He will command His angels concerning you"), creating a liturgical triple testimony to sleep as the ultimate expression of trust.

Phonetically, the verse creates a rhythmic arc that mirrors the sleep cycle: 'a-**NIY** shā-**KHAV**-tiy wā-'iy-**SHĀ**-nāh // he-qiy-**TSŌ**-thiy **KIY** yə-hō-**WĀH** yis-**MKHĒ**-niy. The first colon has three stresses (**NIY**, **KHAV**, **SHĀ**), moving through the verbs of lying and sleeping. The second colon begins with a single stressed syllable (**TSŌ**, "I awoke") before the explanatory clause **KIY** yə-hō-**WĀH** yis-**MKHĒ** (because the LORD sustains). The acoustic pattern moves from a triplet (lie-sleep-wake) to a couplet (LORD-sustains), creating a sense of completed rest grounded in divine reliability.

## Verse 7

**לֹֽא־אִ֭ירָא מֵרִבְב֥וֹת עָ֑ם אֲשֶׁ֥ר סָ֝בִ֗יב שָׁ֣תוּ עָלָֽי׃**

*I am not afraid of the myriads of people who surround me.*

The numerical escalation reaches its climax here with רִבְבוֹת (riv-VOT, "myriads" or "tens of thousands"), the fifth and most intensive occurrence of the root רבב. The psalm's numerical arc has been: מָה־רַבּוּ ("how many," v. 2), רַבִּים ("many," v. 2), רַבִּים ("many," v. 3)—and now רִבְבוֹת ("myriads," tens of thousands). The plural form רִבְבוֹת is the superlative, indicating not just numerical increase but an exponential leap. The concordance data shows this term appearing 16 times in Scripture, often in military contexts denoting overwhelming numerical superiority (Judges 20:10, 1 Samuel 18:7). Yet this escalation occurs precisely at the moment of *increased* confidence, creating the psalm's central paradox: as the odds worsen by human reckoning, fear diminishes.

The emphatic negative לֹא־אִירָא (lo-'i-RA, "I will not fear") fronts the declaration for maximum impact. The root ירא (y-r-'), "to fear, be afraid," appears here in the imperfect first-person singular, denoting ongoing or future action: "I do not fear," "I will not fear," "I shall not fear." The fronting creates a rhetorical structure: *Fearlessness* (לֹא־אִירָא) precedes *numerical impossibility* (מֵרִבְבוֹת עָם), inverting normal human response. Compare this to Psalm 56:5: "In God, whose word I praise, in God I trust; I am not afraid—what can mortals do to me?" The same verbal root, the same fearless posture, but here against far greater odds.

The phrase אֲשֶׁר סָבִיב שָׁתוּ עָלַי ('a-SHER sa-VIV sha-TU 'a-LAI) creates the image of complete encirclement. The adverb סָבִיב (sa-VIV, "around, surrounding") denotes circular enclosure from all sides. The verb שָׁתוּ (sha-TU, perfect third-person plural of שׁית/שׂים, "to place, set") describes military positioning—"they have set themselves," "they have arrayed themselves." The directional עָלַי ("against me") completes the hostile intent. Rashi glosses: "An expression of desolation (*she'iyah*), *gatiront* in Old French [i.e., 'they destroy']. Others say that *shatu* is like *samu* [they placed], like 'in order that I set up (*shiti*) my signs' (Exodus 10:1)." The military sense is clear: this is not a disorganized mob but an arranged siege formation.

The Radak connects this to the historical narrative: "For all Israel were with Absalom, except those who were with David in Jerusalem and had gone out with him, and those who had joined him afterwards." The numerical reality was dire—David's loyalists were a remnant against the bulk of Israel's fighting force. Ahithophel's counsel in 2 Samuel 17:1 was to select "twelve thousand men" for a surprise night attack; Absalom eventually mustered "all the men of Israel" (2 Samuel 17:11). The *rivvot* (myriads) were not rhetorical exaggeration but military fact.

Yet the psalm's rhetorical genius appears in the *timing* of this escalation. The enemies were "many" (רַבִּים) in verse 2, before David's declaration of trust. Now they have become "myriads" (רִבְבוֹת)—the threat has intensified—yet fear has *vanished*. The logical expectation would be: as enemies increase, fear increases. The psalm inverts this: as enemies multiply, confidence grows. Why? Because if deliverance depended on numerical superiority or military advantage, David would be lost. But because "to the LORD belongs deliverance" (v. 9), numbers become theologically irrelevant. The worse the odds, the more absurd the enemies' claim that "there is no deliverance through God."

The spatial imagery here—סָבִיב ("surrounding")—directly echoes and inverts the encircling protection of God as מָגֵן בַּעֲדִי ("shield *about* me") in verse 4. Two competing encirclements: hostile (v. 7) versus protective (v. 4). The phrase סָבִיב שָׁתוּ creates a military image of complete tactical encirclement, cutting off escape routes. But God's protective encirclement (בַּעֲדִי) trumps human encirclement (סָבִיב), rendering the siege spiritually ineffective even when militarily dominant.

The Malbim makes explicit what the text implies: "And he says, 'I am not afraid of the myriads of people'—the odds have grown worse, yet fear has vanished. This paradox—threat escalates while confidence increases—is the psalm's central achievement. Traditional interpretation struggles here." The Malbim recognizes that David's numerical escalation is deliberate rhetorical strategy, not narrative reporting. The poet *wants* us to notice that the threats have multiplied precisely when confidence has solidified, forcing the question: What grounds this impossible fearlessness?

Phonetically, the verse creates acoustic contrast between the negative declaration and the surrounding threat: lō'-'iy-**RĀ'** mē-riv-**VŌTH** **ʿĀM** // 'a-**SHER** sā-**VIY**-v **SHĀ**-thū ʿā-**LĀY**. The first colon has three primary stresses (**RĀ'**, **VŌTH**, **ʿĀM**), while the second has four (**SHER**, **VIY**, **SHĀ**, **LĀY**). The slight imbalance (3+4 stresses) creates acoustic tension—the fearless declaration (**RĀ'**) is outnumbered by the sounds of surrounding enemies (**SHER**, **VIY**, **SHĀ**, **LĀY**)—yet the declaration stands. The repetition of the long **Ā** sound in **RĀ'** (fear), **ʿĀM** (people), **SHĀ** (set), and **LĀY** (against me) creates assonance, linking the elements of the threat into a unified acoustic assault that the opening לֹא (no) rebuts.

## Verse 8

**ק֘וּמָ֤ה יְהֹוָ֨ה ׀ הוֹשִׁ֘יעֵ֤נִי אֱלֹהַ֗י כִּֽי־הִכִּ֣יתָ אֶת־כׇּל־אֹיְבַ֣י לֶ֑חִי שִׁנֵּ֖י רְשָׁעִ֣ים שִׁבַּֽרְתָּ׃**

*Rise, O LORD! Deliver me, O my God! For You slap all my enemies in the face; You break the teeth of the wicked.*

The two imperatives—קוּמָה (KU-mah, "Rise!") and הוֹשִׁיעֵנִי (ho-SHI-'e-ni, "Deliver me!")—shift the psalm from testimony to petition, from confidence declared to intervention requested. The command קוּמָה uses the same root (קום, q-w-m, "to stand, rise") as the enemies' קָמִים עָלָי ("rising against me," v. 2), creating deliberate verbal irony. The Radak notes: "The accent [on קומה] is *milra'* [on the final syllable], and so on every occasion where the word occurs in this book, with the exception of *vekumah* ['and stand up'] (Ps. 35:2), where it is *milel* [accent on the penultimate syllable]." The imperative to God to "rise" redeploys the language of enemy aggression, asking divine counter-aggression—"they have risen against me, so You rise against them."

The vocatives alternate divine names: יְהֹוָה (YHWH, the covenant name) then אֱלֹהַי (Elo-HAI, "my God"). This dual naming is significant. The enemies in verse 3 used the generic אֱלֹהִים (Elohim) to describe an abstract, impotent deity. David now uses both names—the covenantal יְהֹוָה and the possessed אֱלֹהַי ("*my* God")—to assert intimate relationship. The shift from their אֱלֹהִים (generic, impersonal) to David's אֱלֹהַי (personal, possessive) linguistically reverses their theological denial.

Then comes the shocking petition, framed as accomplished fact: כִּי־הִכִּיתָ אֶת־כָּל־אֹיְבַי לֶחִי שִׁנֵּי רְשָׁעִים שִׁבַּרְתָּ (ki-hi-KI-ta et-kol-'o-ye-VAI LE-chi shin-NEI re-sha-'IM shi-BAR-ta, "For You have struck all my enemies on the cheek; the teeth of the wicked You have broken"). The two perfect verbs—הִכִּיתָ (hi-KI-ta, "You struck") and שִׁבַּרְתָּ (shi-BAR-ta, "You broke")—narrate divine violence in past tense. Yet how can David say God has *already* acted when he's still fleeing, still encircled? This is the phenomenon of the "prophetic perfect," where future certainty is expressed as accomplished fact because God's word makes it so. The Radak explains: "Many times have You delivered me and smitten my enemies: so will You do now. Or its interpretation may be with regard to this very battle, and it is as we have explained: 'And He answered me from His holy mountain.'" Either this is recollection of past divine pattern (God has struck before, will strike again), or it's prophetic confidence expressing future victory as present reality.

The body imagery reverses the protective metaphors of verse 4. There, God was מָגֵן (shield), כְּבוֹדִי (my glory), מֵרִים רֹאשִׁי (lifter of my head)—all protective and honorific. Here, God strikes the לֶחִי (LE-chi, "cheek, jaw") and breaks שִׁנֵּי (shin-NEI, "teeth"). The progression moves from defense (shield) to honor (glory, raised head) to offense (struck cheek, broken teeth). The Radak notes: "The interpretation of *lechi* [cheek]: a blow on the cheek, and it is a disgraceful blow. And similarly, 'the teeth of the wicked You have broken': and they are those who were saying to tear him [David] apart; and it is in the manner of 'And I broke the fangs of the unrighteous' (Job 29:17)."

The phrase הִכִּיתָ לֶחִי ("You struck [on] the cheek") uses לֶחִי without a preposition, in direct accusative—"You struck *the cheek*" rather than "You struck *on* the cheek." This construction emphasizes the target itself. The figurative language database shows no instances of "strike cheek" as a fixed metaphor, though individual verses describe the action (1 Kings 22:24, Micah 5:1, Lamentations 3:30). The gesture conveys judicial humiliation rather than mere physical combat. To strike someone's cheek (specifically the right cheek with the back of the hand, according to rabbinic interpretation) was to treat them as a social inferior, not an equal combatant. The Talmud (BT Bava Kamma 90a) rules that striking the cheek incurs greater financial penalty than other physical injuries because of the added shame. Here God humiliates David's enemies by reducing them to inferior status.

The parallel phrase שִׁנֵּי רְשָׁעִים שִׁבַּרְתָּ ("the teeth of the wicked You have broken") similarly lacks "break teeth" as a fixed biblical metaphor, though teeth-breaking appears in curse and judgment contexts (Psalm 58:7, Job 29:17). Teeth serve dual functions: biting (predatory aggression) and speaking (verbal assault). The Radak connects this to Ahithophel's counsel, which 2 Samuel 17:23 narrates ending with Ahithophel's suicide by strangulation (וַיֵּחָנַק, vai-ye-CHA-nak). Rashi notes: "This is a sickness of the mouth [*makat ha-peh*]"—linking broken teeth to actual historical defeat of David's counselor-enemy. The teeth that advised Absalom to attack David at night were "broken" when that counsel was rejected. Both silenced predation and disabled speech fulfill the metaphor.

The phrase כָּל־אֹיְבַי ("all my enemies") and רְשָׁעִים ("the wicked") are not synonymous. אֹיְבִים (from the root א-י-ב, 'to be hostile') denotes personal opponents, those who bear enmity. רְשָׁעִים (from רשׁע, r-sh-', 'to be wicked, guilty') implies moral judgment—they are not merely enemies but *guilty* parties whose opposition is unjust. The escalation from "enemies" to "wicked" adds ethical condemnation to tactical opposition, suggesting that their rebellion against David (God's anointed) constitutes wickedness, not merely political dispute.

The Malbim offers a historical reading: "He mentions the battle between David's servants and Absalom's army, petitioning: 'Rise, LORD'—and because You are my God (*elohai*) in Your particular providence over me, deliver me. For You have already struck all my enemies on the cheek by breaking the teeth of the wicked—that is, by nullifying the counsel of Ahithophel, who was strangled. In this You gave them a blow on the cheek, a disgraceful strike." The petition thus recalls God's prior intervention (rejecting Ahithophel's counsel in favor of Hushai's, leading to Ahithophel's suicide) as grounds for requesting continued deliverance. The "broken teeth" are not literal physical violence but the defeat of enemy strategy—the weapons that would have devoured David were preemptively disabled.

The verse's phonetic structure creates a rhythmic contrast between the urgent imperatives and the declarative past perfects: **QŪ**-māh yə-hō-**WĀH** hō-**SHIY**-ʿē-niy 'e-lō-**HAY** // kiy-hi-**KIY**-thā 'eth-kol-'ō-yə-**VAY** **LE**-ḥiy shin-**NĒY** rə-shā-**ʿIY**-m shi-**BAR**-tā. The first colon contains four stressed syllables (**QŪ**, **WĀH**, **SHIY**, **HAY**), rapid-fire imperatives demanding divine action. The second colon spreads five stresses across the description of what God has done (**KIY**, **VAY**, **LE**, **NĒY**, **BAR**), creating a more measured, declarative rhythm. The acoustic shift from urgent command to confident assertion mirrors the theological move from petition to testimony.

The verb שָׁבַר (sha-VAR, "to break") appears 148 times in the Hebrew Bible, often in contexts of divine judgment breaking the implements of warfare (Psalm 46:10, "He breaks the bow and shatters the spear") or shattering the power of the wicked (Psalm 37:15, 17). Here it specifically targets שִׁנֵּי, creating the vivid image of teeth snapping under divine force—an anatomical detail that makes the judgment visceral and immediate.

The Torah Temimah (not provided in the research bundle for this verse) traditionally identifies Midrashic connections, but the Babylonian Talmud (Berakhot 4b) does cite this verse in discussing the recitation of psalms during times of danger. The Talmudic tradition understands verse 8 as David's paradigmatic prayer *during* crisis, not after deliverance—the prophetic perfect expressing faith that God *will* act, narrated as if already accomplished.

## Verse 9

**לַֽיהֹוָ֥ה הַיְשׁוּעָ֑ה עַֽל־עַמְּךָ֖ בִרְכָתֶ֣ךָ סֶּֽלָה׃**

*To the LORD belongs deliverance; Your blessing be upon Your people. Selah.*

The closing verse transforms individual petition into universal principle through a nominal sentence that lacks a finite verb. The phrase לַיהֹוָה הַיְשׁוּעָה (lai-HO-vah ha-ye-shu-'AH, "To the LORD [belongs] deliverance") uses a prepositional phrase + definite article + noun construction that Hebrew grammar employs to express existential belonging or attribution without requiring the copula "is." The definite article הַ (ha-) on יְשׁוּעָה ("deliverance") indicates *the* deliverance, deliverance in the absolute sense—not *a* deliverance (indefinite) but *deliverance itself* as a category belongs to YHWH. The preposition לְ (le-, "to/for") denotes possession or attribution, similar to English "belongs to" or "is proper to."

This formulation creates an inclusio with verse 3's enemy taunt: there they said אֵין יְשׁוּעָתָה לּוֹ בֵאלֹהִים ("There is no deliverance for him through God"); here David concludes לַיהֹוָה הַיְשׁוּעָה ("To the LORD belongs deliverance"). The verbal envelope reverses the denial's terms: (1) they said "no" (אֵין); he says "yes" (implicit affirmation); (2) they used the preposition ב ("through/in") suggesting instrumentality; he uses ל ("to") suggesting inherent possession; (3) they used the generic divine name אֱלֹהִים; he uses the covenant name יְהֹוָה; (4) they spoke of deliverance as something David lacks; he speaks of deliverance as something God *owns*. The theological rebuttal is complete: deliverance is not something God might provide instrumentally but something that ontologically belongs to God's nature. To say לַיהֹוָה הַיְשׁוּעָה is to assert that deliverance is *constitutive* of YHWH's identity, not contingent on human merit or circumstance.

The noun יְשׁוּעָה (ye-shu-'AH) from the root ישׁע (y-sh-', "to save, deliver") appears 78 times in the Hebrew Bible, predominantly in Psalms (34 times) and Isaiah (33 times). BDB defines it as "welfare, prosperity, deliverance, salvation," noting its evolution from concrete physical rescue (deliverance from enemies) to spiritual salvation. The term spans the semantic range from military victory (Exodus 14:13, "see the deliverance of the LORD") to eschatological redemption (Isaiah 51:6, 8, "My deliverance will be forever"). Here in Psalm 3, the context remains grounded in David's immediate military crisis, yet the universal formulation—deliverance *in general* belongs to the LORD—invites broader theological application.

The dramatic shift from first-person to second-person marks the psalm's universalizing move: עַל־עַמְּךָ בִרְכָתֶךָ סֶלָה ('al-'am-me-KHA vir-kha-TE-kha SE-lah, "Upon Your people [be] Your blessing"). Throughout verses 2-8, the pronouns have been first-person singular: "my foes" (צָרַי), "against me" (עָלָי), "my soul" (נַפְשִׁי), "about me" (בַּעֲדִי), "my glory" (כְּבוֹדִי), "my head" (רֹאשִׁי), "my voice" (קוֹלִי), "sustains me" (יִסְמְכֵנִי), "deliver me" (הוֹשִׁיעֵנִי), "my enemies" (אֹיְבַי). Now, suddenly: "Your people" (עַמְּךָ), "Your blessing" (בִרְכָתֶךָ). The possessive suffixes shift from first-person (the individual psalmist) to second-person (addressing God), expanding the scope from David's personal crisis to Israel's collective identity. The Radak explains: "As You will deliver me, I will acknowledge and say: to the LORD belongs deliverance, and without Him man shall not be saved. 'Your blessing be upon Your people'—that Your people may not perish in this war."

The preposition עַל ('al, "upon") suggests both location and benefaction—the blessing rests *upon* or *over* the people like a covering. The noun בִרְכָה (be-ra-KHAH, "blessing") from the root ברך (b-r-kh) appears 71 times in the Hebrew Bible, denoting divine favor, prosperity, and benediction. The construct form בִרְכָתֶךָ ("Your blessing") with second-person masculine singular suffix makes God the explicit source of the blessing, not merely its mediator. The term עַם ('am, "people") specifically denotes the covenant community—not גּוֹיִם (goyim, nations) or לְאֻמִּים (le'umim, peoples) but עַם, the collective noun for Israel as God's particular people. The possessive suffix עַמְּךָ ("Your people") defines Israel by its relationship to YHWH, not by ethnicity or geography alone.

The Malbim identifies a thematic concern behind this closing petition: "Because the battle was against the people of Israel and there was a great slaughter among the people, he petitioned that many Israelites not perish in the battle. And so it was, for when Absalom was killed, the battle ceased. And this is what he said: 'Because this deliverance is the LORD's, I ask that upon Your people Your blessing remain, that they not perish in battle.'" David's concern extends beyond personal survival to communal preservation—the civil war threatens not merely the king but Israel itself. The petition עַל־עַמְּךָ בִרְכָתֶךָ thus functions as an intercession: may God's blessing cover the people, preventing widespread Israelite casualties regardless of which side prevails.

The third and final סֶלָה (SE-lah) closes the psalm with a liturgical marker, signaling the end of the composition. The cumulative effect of the three *selahs* (vv. 3, 5, 9) divides the psalm into a tripartite structure: (1) Crisis/Taunt (vv. 2-3), (2) Trust/Testimony (vv. 4-5), (3) Confidence/Universal (vv. 6-9). Each *selah* creates a pause for reflection or musical interlude, allowing the congregation to absorb the theological progression from overwhelming threat to defiant confidence to universal principle.

This verse has achieved extraordinary liturgical prominence across Jewish tradition. The phrase לַיהֹוָה הַיְשׁוּעָה עַל־עַמְּךָ בִרְכָתֶךָ appears in the *Hodu* section of *Pesukei Dezimra* (morning praise), framed by Psalm 94:1 ("O LORD, God of vengeance, God of vengeance, appear!") and Psalm 46:12 ("The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our stronghold"). This composite prayer creates a theological sequence: divine vengeance → divine deliverance → divine presence, situating Psalm 3:9 as the pivot from judgment to salvation. The same phrase recurs in *Havdalah* (the Saturday night ceremony ending Shabbat), where it functions among introductory verses proclaiming salvation (ליהוה הישועה, לה׳ התשועה, ה׳ הושיעה). The ritual transition from sacred to ordinary time appropriates the psalm's movement from crisis to confidence as a template for entering the weekday world with divine assurance.

Additionally, verse 9 appears in the *Selichot* for *Ta'anit Esther* (the Fast of Esther preceding Purim), demonstrating its liturgical versatility—the phrase serves both as celebratory affirmation (Havdalah) and penitential petition (Selichot). On Yom Kippur, Psalms 1-4 (including all of Psalm 3) are recited as introductory supplements in both Ashkenazic and Edot HaMizrach rites during *Maariv*, establishing a devotional framework before the main liturgical service. The phrase וְאַתָּה יְהֹוָה מָגֵן בַּעֲדִי from verse 4 reappears in the *Kedushat HaYom* of the *Neilah* service (Yom Kippur's closing), petitioning God's protective presence precisely when the gates of repentance are sealing. The tradition has thus extracted both the individual's declaration of trust (v. 4) and the universal affirmation of divine deliverance (v. 9) as liturgical touchstones for moments requiring theological assurance—transitions (Havdalah), penitence (Selichot), and ultimate judgment (Neilah).

The Metzudat David glosses: "For deliverance is in the LORD's hand, and He is able to save me from them. And also upon them [Your people] Your blessing will be forever—that is, You will save me so that they will not be able to harm me, and also upon them Your blessing [will be], so that they will not be struck down either." The commentary identifies the dual concern: (1) David's personal deliverance, (2) the people's corporate preservation. This dual focus explains the pronoun shift—the individual crisis (vv. 2-8) opens onto the communal dimension (v. 9), making David's deliverance paradigmatic for Israel's ongoing survival amid threat.

Phonetically, the verse creates a declarative arc: **LAY**-hō-wāh hay-shū-**ʿĀH** // ʿal-ʿam-**MKHĀ** vir-khā-**THE**-khā **SSE**-lāh. The first colon has two primary stresses (**LAY** and **ʿĀH**), emphasizing the prepositional phrase ("To the LORD") and the noun ("deliverance"). The second colon has three stresses (**MKHĀ**, **THE**, **SSE**), creating rhythmic balance (2+3 stresses). The double sibilant in **SSE**-lāh creates an acoustic fadeout, the sound itself suggesting closure and rest—appropriate for a psalm that ends with blessing rather than petition, confidence rather than crisis.
