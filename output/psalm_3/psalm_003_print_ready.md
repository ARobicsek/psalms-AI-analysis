# Commentary on Psalm 3
---
## Introduction
Psalm 3 is small-scale drama with a wide horizon. Its superscription ties it to a particular catastrophe—David fleeing his son Absalom (2 Samuel 15–18)—but the poem’s craft turns a family crisis into a public theology. The plot is simple: there is a surge of adversaries (“How many are my foes,” מָה־רַבּוּ צָרַי, v. 2), a taunt that nullifies God’s relevance (“No deliverance for him in God,” אֵין יְשׁוּעָתָה לּוֹ בֵאלֹקִים, v. 3), a sharp reversal (“But You, LORD,” וְאַתָּה ה׳, v. 4), and a closing confession whose grammar is timeless: “To YHWH belongs deliverance” (לַה׳ הַיְשׁוּעָה, v. 9). The poem is a refutation not by logic but by life: the psalmist lies down to sleep and wakes (v. 6). That ordinary cycle—bed, sleep, morning—becomes the decisive counter-argument to “no deliverance.”
The poet builds the threat with anaphora (a deliberate repetition): “How many … many … many” (מָה־רַבּוּ … רַבִּים … רַבִּים, vv. 2–3), culminating later in the superlative “myriads” (רִבְבוֹת, v. 7). Equally important is the voice of the opponents in v. 3. The phrase “Many say of my life/self” (רַבִּים אֹמְרִים לְנַפְשִׁי) likely means “about me,” not “to me.” The preposition לְ with “soul/life” can bear that sense, as in “Pharaoh will say concerning (לְ) the Israelites” (Exodus 14:3). Their verdict is precise: “no deliverance for him in God” (אֵין יְשׁוּעָתָה לּוֹ בֵאלֹקִים). The preposition ב (in/through) can indicate means as well as sphere; they deny that God is either the arena or instrument of rescue. They also avoid the covenant name YHWH (ה׳), choosing the more generic Elohim (אֱלֹקִים). In a poem that will overwhelmingly say “YHWH,” that choice betrays their theology: God, for them, is an abstraction—“God”—not a partner bound to Israel.
Verse 4’s opening, “But You, YHWH” (וְאַתָּה ה׳), is the hinge. Three images follow, and they map a person’s restoration from circumference to center. First, “a shield around me” (מָגֵן בַּעֲדִי). The preposition בַּעַד can mean “on behalf of” but also “around,” as when one is shut “behind/within” doors. Here the sense is encirclement—God as a perimeter. This answers the later line “they have set themselves around me” (סָבִיב שָׁתוּ עָלַי, v. 7). There are competing rings: hostile encirclement versus protective encirclement. Psalm 125:2 makes the same point with topography: “Jerusalem—hills surround her; and YHWH surrounds His people” (יְרוּשָׁלַ‍ִם הָרִים סָבִיב לָהּ וַה׳ סָבִיב לְעַמּוֹ). Second, “my glory” (כְּבוֹדִי). The noun can mean “honor,” but it also leans toward the inner self (“my glory rejoices,” Psalm 16:9). Medievals split here: is God the psalmist’s honor, or the One who restores it? Either way, the thrust is dignity recovered. Third, “the lifter of my head” (וּמֵרִים רֹאשִׁי). The idiom is rare and resonant (cf. Psalm 110:7): a bowed head rises.
The testimony that follows gets at the psalm’s theology of place and time. “My voice—I call to YHWH, and He answers me from His holy mountain” (ק֭וֹלִי אֶל־ה׳ אֶקְרָא וַיַּעֲנֵנִי מֵהַר קׇדְשׁוֹ, v. 5). The superscription says David is fleeing Jerusalem; verse 5 says the answer comes “from His holy mountain,” Zion. Either the poet is simply naming God’s dwelling (Zion, where the ark rests), or he is quietly insisting that God’s presence answers from Zion even when the king is beyond Zion’s borders. Space does not limit this God. The verb “He answered” (וַיַּעֲנֵנִי) is in the past; grammarians call this a “prophetic perfect,” a way of speaking about the certain future as if it has already occurred. Traditional commentators put it more simply: David is so sure of the answer that he speaks of it as done.
Then, unexpectedly, this warrior lays down: “I lie down and sleep; I wake, for YHWH sustains me” (אֲנִי שָׁכַבְתִּי וָאִישָׁנָה הֱקִיצוֹתִי כִּי ה׳ יִסְמְכֵנִי, v. 6). Sleep often means death in the Psalms (e.g., Psalm 13:4: “lest I sleep the sleep of death,” פֶּן־אִישַׁן הַמָּוֶת) or trust (Psalm 4:9: “In peace I will lie down and sleep”). Here it is neither metaphor nor aspiration: it is report. In a night when Ahithophel is counseling immediate attack (2 Samuel 17:1–4), the psalmist lies down. The verb “sustain” (סמך) is physical as much as emotional (cf. Psalm 145:14: “YHWH supports [סוֹמֵךְ] all who fall”). The body sleeping under siege is the poem’s rebuttal of the taunt. If there were “no deliverance in God,” sleep would be impossible.
Paradoxically, the threat now intensifies precisely when the fear disappears: “I will not fear the myriads of people” (לֹא־אִירָא מֵרִבְבוֹת עָם, v. 7). The root ר־ב־ב (“many”) that began the poem returns in superlative form. The encirclement is literal—“they have set themselves around me” (סָבִיב שָׁתוּ עָלַי)—but encirclement has already been countered by “shield around me” (מָגֵן בַּעֲדִי). The poem refuses arithmetic. It is not that the enemies are few—it is that numbers do not matter when deliverance “belongs to YHWH.”
So the king prays for God to “rise” (ק֘וּמָה ה׳ … הוֹשִׁיעֵנִי, v. 8), repurposing the enemy’s verb: they “rise against me” (קָמִים עָלַי, v. 2), therefore—rise against them. The second half of v. 8 is violent and vivid: cheeks struck, teeth broken—humiliation and disarming. “Striking the cheek” signals shame (Lamentations 3:30; Micah 5:1), and “breaking teeth” silences the devouring mouth (Job 29:17: “I broke the fangs of the unrighteous”; cf. Psalm 58:7: “O God, break their teeth in their mouth”). The verbs are again in the past (“You struck,” הִכִּיתָ; “You broke,” שִׁבַּרְתָּ), the prophetic-perfect grammar of faith. The body language of verse 4 (shield, lifted head) is mirrored here by the enemies’ face and teeth; protection and honor for the psalmist become disgrace and disarmament for the wicked.
The finale is elegantly spare: “To YHWH belongs deliverance; upon Your people, Your blessing, Selah” (לַה׳ הַיְשׁוּעָה עַל־עַמְּךָ בִרְכָתֶךָ סֶלָה, v. 9). Grammatically it is a nominal sentence (no verb), a timeless axiom. The inclusio is complete: the first speech claims “no deliverance in God” (v. 3); the last line announces “deliverance belongs to YHWH.” And the psalm that began in the singular (my foes, my voice, my head) ends in the plural: “Your people.” The movement from “me” to “us” is the psalm’s most important act of publicness. What happens to the king becomes the community’s hope.
Technical notes for this essay: a “colon” is a single poetic line within a verse; “inclusio” is a framing device that repeats a term or theme at the start and close; “anaphora” is deliberate repetition of a word or phrase; a “prophetic perfect” is a past-tense form used to express certain future; a “Hiphil participle” is a Hebrew verb form that often indicates causation (e.g., “the lifter,” מֵרִים, “the one who causes the head to lift”).
The poem’s durability in Jewish prayer reflects precisely this turn toward the body and the night. In the Bedtime Shema, Psalm 3 is an answerable prayer—one sleeps after saying it. On Yom Kippur evening, it is a posture: assailed yet defended, guilty but not godless, asking that the “blessing be upon Your people.”
## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use
#### Full psalm
In the Bedtime Shema (Kriat Shema al ha‑Mitah) both Ashkenazic and Sefardi rites include Psalm 3 substantially in full (typically vv. 2–9), precisely where one prepares to sleep under God’s guard. The juxtaposition with Psalm 91 (“He will command His angels concerning you”) turns David’s sleep under siege into a nightly practice of trust.
Several rites also place Psalm 3 within psalm clusters at Yom Kippur Maariv (e.g., Psalms 1–4), a contemplative prelude before the body of the service. The poem’s arc—from encirclement to confidence—fits the day’s spiritual labor.
#### Key verses
Psalm 3:7: לֹֽא־אִירָא מֵרִבְבוֹת עָם אֲשֶׁר סָבִיב שָׁתוּ עָלָי (“I will not fear the myriads of people who surround me”). In Edot HaMizrach, this verse is embedded among the morning preliminaries (Birkhot ha‑Shachar) in a biblical collage that strengthens the heart before prayer: “לֹא־אִירָא מֵרִבְבוֹת עָם… וַאֲנִי בַּה׳ אֲצַפֶּה” (“I will not fear … and I in the LORD will hope”). The placement makes the psalm’s fearlessness a threshold stance.
Psalm 3:9: לַֽה׳ הַיְשׁוּעָה עַל־עַמְּךָ בִרְכָתֶךָ סֶּלָה (“To YHWH belongs deliverance; Your blessing be upon Your people, Selah”). This line appears in Pesukei de‑Zimra’s Hodu sequence (Shacharit) alongside verses of divine aid: “לַה׳ הַיְשׁוּעָה … ה׳ צְבָקוֹת עִמָּנוּ” (“To the LORD belongs deliverance … the LORD of Hosts is with us”). It also punctuates Havdalah’s opening verses on Saturday night, when one reenters the week proclaiming that salvation is God’s. In Selichot for fasts (e.g., Ta’anit Esther), the same line voices corporate hope in a penitential key.
#### Phrases
Psalm 3:4: וְאַתָּה ה׳ מָגֵן בַּעֲדִי (“But You, LORD, are a shield around me”). In Ashkenazi Neilah (Yom Kippur’s close), some versions weave this confession into Kedushat ha‑Yom’s petitions: “וְאַתָּה ה׳ מָגֵן בַּעֲדִי … קֵל מֶלֶךְ יוֹשֵׁב עַל כִּסֵּא רַחֲמִים” (“And You, O LORD, are a shield around me … God, King, seated on a throne of mercy”). The phrase personalizes the last appeal before the gates close.
Psalm 3:8: שִׁנֵּי רְשָׁעִים שִׁבַּרְתָּ (“You broke the teeth of the wicked”). While not a common direct recitation, the imagery appears in piyyutim (liturgical poems) adapted for penitential days, where the idiom of disarming the devourer becomes a metaphor for divine vindication: “שִׁנֵּי רְשָׁעִים בֶּחָצָץ תִּגְרוֹס” (“Grind the teeth of the wicked in the gravel”). Liturgy thus preserves the psalm’s bite while redirecting it toward moral enemies.
The liturgical uses move with the psalm’s pshat (plain sense): bedtime recitation leans into v. 6’s embodied trust; festival and fast-day settings amplify v. 9’s public benediction. In each case, private courage becomes communal prayer.

## Verse-by-Verse Commentary
**Verse 1**
מִזְמ֥וֹר לְדָוִ֑ד בְּ֝בׇרְח֗וֹ מִפְּנֵ֤י ׀ אַבְשָׁל֬וֹם בְּנֽוֹ׃
The superscription—מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד בְּבָרְחוֹ מִפְּנֵי אַבְשָׁלוֹם בְּנוֹ (“A psalm of David when he fled from Absalom his son”)—does more than date the poem. It creates the moral and emotional field of the prayer: the enemy is a son. The infinitive construct בְּבָרְחוֹ (“when he fled”) is the standard Hebrew way to mark a circumstance in time; it situates the psalm in motion, with the king ascending the Mount of Olives weeping (2 Samuel 15:30). The dissonance between “psalm” (מִזְמוֹר) and “fleeing” sharpened rabbinic hearing. Berakhot 7b famously asks: Shouldn’t it read קִינָה (“lament”), not “psalm”? The answer is paradoxical: when the prophet Nathan foretold that evil would arise “from your own house” (2 Samuel 12:11), David feared an unmerciful adversary; upon learning it was his son, he found strange relief—still betrayal, yet not a stranger’s cruelty. Hence, “psalm.”
Classical commentators explore the line’s economy. Radak reads the superscription as contemporaneous: the prayer rises “as he ascended the Mount of Olives,” before any resolution. The word order lays stress on the scandal of kinship: “Absalom—his son” (אַבְשָׁלוֹם בְּנוֹ), so that the possessive hangs like a weight over the verse. The superscription is one of only a small set that anchor a psalm in a narrative episode, and such labels are already a kind of interpretation: the poem will be heard through Absalom, however widely it travels liturgically.
The superscription also stages a theological tension that the psalm itself will test: place. If David is fleeing Jerusalem, what does it mean to be answered “from His holy mountain” (v. 5)? The title sets that paradox in motion. Later tradition found in this pairing a template for prayer “on the run”—not only during a political crisis but whenever one’s safe places fail. The liturgy keeps the superscription tacit (we don’t recite it at night), but it hovers: every recitation hears the poem “when he fled,” including the quiet, private flights of the heart.
Finally, the superscription connects the poem’s body imagery to the story: a humiliated king “with head covered” (2 Samuel 15:30) will later bless “You … lifter of my head” (v. 4). The title therefore anticipates the poem’s choreography from bowed to raised, from encircled to protected.  
**Verse 2**
ה׳ מָה־רַבּ֣וּ צָרָ֑י רַ֝בִּ֗ים קָמִ֥ים עָלָֽי׃
“ה׳ מָה־רַבּוּ צָרָי; רַבִּים קָמִים עָלָי” (“O LORD, how many are my foes; many are rising against me”). The line opens with astonished address—מָה־רַבּוּ (“how many!”)—the same interjection that elsewhere marvels at God’s works (Psalm 104:24) but here counts adversaries. The repetition of the root ר־ב־ב (“many”) intensifies the sense of multiplication: מָה־רַבּוּ … רַבִּים. The participle קָמִים (“rising, standing up”) suggests continuous action; the front is active, not static.
The noun צַר (“foe”) is built on a root meaning “to press, constrict.” The “foe” is one who narrows, hems in—a precision that resonates with v. 7’s “surrounding” (סָבִיב). Rashi emphasizes the quality, not just the quantity, of the threat: “men great in Torah … and in wisdom … Doeg and Ahithophel.” Radak notes the political sweep: “the greater part of Israel … and Amasa,” David’s own nephew. The verse’s compactness allows all of that: the enemies are many in number, but also socially weighty, and morally constricting.
The parallelism is simple and forceful. In the terms of Hebrew poetics, the second colon (“Many are rising against me”) confirms and specifies the first. “A is so, and what’s more, B”: foes are many, and what makes it felt is their rising, their initiative. Some readers hear the line’s cadence as contributing to its pressure—the repeated -ַי ending (“upon me,” עָלַי; “my foes,” צָרַי) makes the self the sentence’s landing place. But the key is the progression: the opening cry is not numbers alone; it is numbers moving.
Already the psalm is staging an argument between arithmetic and allegiance. The “many” (רַבִּים) will become “myriads” (רִבְבוֹת) at the precise moment fear departs (v. 7). The poem does not deny the numbers; it denies their ultimacy. Verse 2 sets up that proof by piling them up.  
**Verse 3**
רַבִּים֮ אֹמְרִ֢ים לְנַ֫פְשִׁ֥י אֵ֤ין יְֽשׁוּעָ֓תָה לּ֬וֹ בֵאלֹקִ֬ים סֶֽלָה׃
“רַבִּים אֹמְרִים לְנַפְשִׁי: אֵין יְשׁוּעָתָה לּוֹ בֵאלֹקִים סֶלָה” (“Many are saying of me, ‘There is no deliverance for him in God.’ Selah”). Here the assault becomes verbal and theological. The prepositional phrase לְנַפְשִׁי is best heard “about me,” not “to me” (cf. Exodus 14:3: “Pharaoh will say concerning the Israelites,” יֹאמַר פַּרְעֹה לִבְנֵי־יִשְׂרָאֵל). The effect is to exclude the psalmist from their conversation: they speak over him, in the third person, as if his case were already adjudicated.
Two features make the taunt sting. First, the form יְשׁוּעָתָה (“his deliverance”) with its feminine ending attracted medieval notice; Ibn Ezra calls it an elegant form. More crucial is the preposition ב in בֵאלֹקִים: “in/through God.” The claim is not merely that God is absent but that God is not the medium by which deliverance happens for this man. The speech also avoids the covenant name YHWH. The psalmist will say YHWH again and again; the opponents say Elohim, “God,” which in Psalms can name the true God but here sounds impersonal and abstract.
Radak grounds the taunt in the Absalom story: many judged David’s Bathsheba sin to have permanently severed him from divine favor; some even said he had “no portion in the world to come.” The psalm turns that verdict into a line for the ages: “no deliverance in God.” The entire poem will wrap itself around this sentence, answering it first with testimony (vv. 4–6) and then with prayer (vv. 7–8) and finally with doxology (v. 9).
Selah marks a pause. However we interpret the term musically, its placement here lets the line hang like a charge in the air. One can imagine the congregation breathing, letting the deniers’ words register, so that the rebuttal—“But You, YHWH”—comes with full force.  
**Verse 4**
וְאַתָּ֣ה ה׳ מָגֵ֣ן בַּעֲדִ֑י כְּ֝בוֹדִ֗י וּמֵרִ֥ים רֹאשִֽׁי׃
“וְאַתָּה ה׳ מָגֵן בַּעֲדִי; כְּבוֹדִי, וּמֵרִים רֹאשִׁי” (“But You, YHWH, are a shield around me; my glory, and the lifter of my head”). The adversative “But You” (וְאַתָּה) is as strong as English can render it: the line pivots from what others say to whom the psalmist knows. Three metaphors cascade.
A. “Shield around me” (מָגֵן בַּעֲדִי). The preposition בַּעַד can signal “on behalf of,” but in contexts of enclosure it denotes “around, behind.” Here it names encirclement. The image is not a single shield held forward but a ring of defense. This directly counters the siege phrasing of v. 7 (“they set themselves around me,” סָבִיב שָׁתוּ עָלָי). Within the psalm, two circles close around the speaker; the inner is stronger.
B. “My glory” (כְּבוֹדִי). Glory (כָּבוֹד) often denotes weight, honor, or radiance, and is frequently God’s own. To claim God as “my glory” means either that God is the speaker’s honor (apposition) or that God restores it (causation). Radak suggests both. Either way, the phrase reverses humiliation—note the narrative backdrop of a king crossing the Kidron with covered head (2 Sam 15:30). This is not bravado; it is the re-anchoring of identity in relationship: God is the one who confers weight on a life.
C. “The lifter of my head” (וּמֵרִים רֹאשִׁי). The Hiphil participle מֵרִים is causative: the One who causes my head to rise. The idiom is rare (cf. Psalm 110:7: “he lifts his head”) and is the perfect counterpart to v. 8’s humiliation of the enemy’s face (cheek) and mouth (teeth). Heads are raised or lowered in the Psalms as signs of honor and shame; the poem is carefully choreographed: his head rises, their cheeks are struck.
The line also recovers the covenant name YHWH (ה׳), which the opponents avoided in v. 3. That naming itself is part of the poem’s argument: the God who encircles, honors, and raises is not “a god” but Israel’s YHWH. The theology is embodied: encirclement is felt, lifting is seen, honor is borne.  
**Verse 5**
ק֭וֹלִי אֶל־ה׳ אֶקְרָ֑א וַיַּעֲנֵ֨נִי מֵהַ֖ר קׇדְשׁ֣וֹ סֶֽלָה׃
“קוֹלִי אֶל־ה׳ אֶקְרָא; וַיַּעֲנֵנִי מֵהַר קׇדְשׁוֹ, סֶלָה” (“My voice—I call to YHWH; and He answers me from His holy mountain. Selah”). The grammar compresses experience: fronting “my voice” (קוֹלִי) emphasizes the cry itself, and the verb “He answers” is in the past (וַיַּעֲנֵנִי) even as the poem is still in flight. Traditional explanations call this the prophetic perfect: speech of what is certain as if already accomplished. It is testimony, not only aspiration.
“From His holy mountain” (מֵהַר קׇדְשׁוֹ) reintroduces Zion just where the superscription had taken us away from it. The tension is deliberate: the king is not there; God is. Ibn Ezra connects the phrase to the ark on Zion (2 Samuel 6), and Radak suggests even Mount Moriah—the future temple site—may be in view. In either case, the theology is the same: God answers “from Zion” even when the petitioner is beyond Zion. This is not a ranked geography but a way of saying that God’s answering presence is anchored in the holy but not confined to it.
Selah again asks for a pause after the testimony: the poem wants the congregation to absorb that God answers, and from God’s place. In the psalm’s story (with Ahithophel and Hushai), one could even hear an allusion: God “answered … from His holy mountain” when Hushai’s counsel prevailed and the king’s life was spared (2 Samuel 17:14). But the poetry keeps it general: it is the pattern that matters.
The line is also liturgically suggestive. In the morning service, worshipers will “cry with my voice” (קוֹלִי) and trust a divine answer from the mountain (temple language pervades the Amidah). Psalm 3 turns that into a declarative preface to fearlessness.  
**Verse 6**
אֲנִ֥י שָׁכַ֗בְתִּי וָאִ֫ישָׁ֥נָה הֱקִיצ֑וֹתִי כִּ֖י ה׳ יִסְמְכֵֽנִי׃
“אֲנִי שָׁכַבְתִּי וָאִישָׁנָה; הֱקִיצוֹתִי, כִּי ה׳ יִסְמְכֵנִי” (“I lay down and slept; I awoke, for YHWH sustains me”). Three perfect verbs narrate a night: lay down, slept, woke. The sequence is mundane and therefore daring. In context, vigilance would be prudent; instead, the psalmist sleeps. The reason clause is crucial: “for YHWH sustains me.” The verb סמ״ך (to support) is concrete: to hold up, keep from falling (cf. Psalm 37:24: “Though he fall, he shall not be cast headlong, for YHWH holds his hand”; Psalm 145:14: “YHWH supports all who fall”). The past night is the proof of present faith: I slept—and that is my argument.
The sleep idiom in the Psalms can be ominous (“sleep of death,” Psalm 13:4) or serene (Psalm 4:9). Psalm 3 stands unique in reporting the full cycle as a sign of God’s active support amid danger. The body becomes witness. This is why the Bedtime Shema places Psalm 3 at the threshold of sleep, alongside Psalm 91. The tradition intuited the psalm’s logic: trust is not only cognitive assent; it is learned and enacted by the body.
Rashi reads the line psychologically: the psalmist’s heart was clogged with worry until he awoke, sustained by trust. Radak notes the difference between ordinary waking (often troubled by bad dreams when one sleeps in distress) and this waking (“I awoke” without terror). The line’s structure contains the argument: first the report, then the because—“for YHWH sustains me.” The sustaining is ongoing (imperfect tense יִסְמְכֵנִי can mean “keeps sustaining me”), so that past night, present calm, and future mornings are all of a piece.
The verse also prepares the paradox that follows: if God’s sustaining is the ground, the escalation of numbers to “myriads” will not shake the speaker. Sleep was not a break from battle; it was a rehearsal of trust.  
**Verse 7**
לֹֽא־אִ֭ירָא מֵרִבְב֥וֹת עָ֑ם אֲשֶׁ֥ר סָ֝בִ֗יב שָׁ֣תוּ עָלָֽי׃
“לֹא־אִירָא מֵרִבְבוֹת עָם, אֲשֶׁר סָבִיב שָׁתוּ עָלָי” (“I will not fear the myriads of people who set themselves around me”). The rhetoric turns paradoxical: the opponents are now not merely “many” (רַבִּים) but “tens of thousands” (רִבְבוֹת)—and that is precisely when fear evaporates (“I will not fear”). The poem refuses the logic that equates numbers with truth or inevitability. It is not that the threat is exaggerated; indeed, “they set themselves around me” suggests deployment. But fear is measured by trust, not arithmetic.
The verb שִׁית (“to set, place”) in שָׁתוּ here connotes arrangment, even military array (cf. Isaiah 22:7: שֹׁת שָׁתוּ הַשַּׁעְרָה, “they set themselves toward the gate”). Rashi offers both “set/arrayed” and “laid waste” senses; Radak favors the military nuance: they “set their battle” around me. The keyword is “around” (סָבִיב), which links back to v. 4’s “shield around me” (מָגֵן בַּעֲדִי). The same spatial English preposition does heavy work: the hostile circle meets the protective circle. Psalm 125:2, cited earlier, makes the same map: hills around Jerusalem; YHWH around His people.
The negative “I will not fear” (לֹא־אִירָא) is a chosen stance, not a reflex. In the phonetic guide provided (lō'-'iy-**RĀ'**), the stressed final syllable falls on the verb’s end, giving the negation a crisp punch. But more important is the logic established by v. 6: last night’s sleep under God’s support has trained the speaker for this morning’s encirclement. This line is where the psalm declares its purpose: not to claim there are few enemies, but to reveal that “myriads” do not have the last word when “deliverance belongs to YHWH.”  
**Verse 8**
ק֘וּמָ֤ה ה׳ ׀ הוֹשִׁ֘יעֵ֤נִי אֱלֹקַ֗י כִּֽי־הִכִּ֣יתָ אֶת־כׇּל־אֹיְבַ֣י לֶ֑חִי שִׁנֵּ֖י רְשָׁעִ֣ים שִׁבַּֽרְתָּ׃
“ק֘וּמָ֤ה ה׳ הוֹשִׁיעֵנִי אֱלֹקַי; כִּי־הִכִּיתָ אֶת־כָּל־אֹיְבַי לֶחִי, שִׁנֵּי רְשָׁעִים שִׁבַּרְתָּ” (“Rise, O YHWH; deliver me, my God; for You have struck all my enemies on the cheek; You have broken the teeth of the wicked”). The imperatives are succinct and bold: “Rise” (ק֘וּמָה), “Deliver” (הוֹשִׁיעֵנִי). The verb קוּם echoes the earlier “many are rising against me” (רַבִּים קָמִים עָלַי, v. 2). The psalmist redirects the motion: enemy rising calls divine rising.
The perfect verbs that follow (הִכִּיתָ, “You struck”; שִׁבַּרְתָּ, “You broke”) read as completed acts. Traditional interpretation hears here the “prophetic perfect”: that which is certain is spoken as done. Another reading sees recollection: “You have often struck … so do now.” Either way, the grammar serves as rhetoric—confident petition.
The imagery is precise. To strike the cheek (לֶחִי) is a gesture of humiliation (Lamentations 3:30: “Let him offer his cheek to the smiter and be sated with insults”; Micah 5:1: “They strike the judge of Israel on the cheek”). To break teeth (שִׁנַּיִם) is to strip predators of their bite and to silence the mouth that devours and speaks harm (Job 29:17: “I broke the fangs of the unrighteous”; Psalm 58:7: “O God, break their teeth in their mouth”). Together, they are the offensive counterpart to verse 4’s defensive and honorific images. There, God encircles and lifts; here, God disgraces and disarms.
Rabbinic midrash—reading the Absalom story—saw Ahithophel’s suicide as a “mouth-affliction” and linked it to this verse. Historically specific or not, the psalm’s language remains architectural: God’s judgment rearranges the face (cheek) and mouth (teeth) of the wicked just as God has raised the head of the faithful. The ethics are equally clear: those who said “no deliverance in God” are named here “the wicked” (רְשָׁעִים), giving the conflict a moral dimension beyond mere politics.
The alternation of names—“Rise, YHWH … deliver me, my God [אֱלֹקַי]”—reclaims both covenantal intimacy (YHWH) and personal relation (“my God”), answering the opponents’ generic “Elohim” in v. 3.  
**Verse 9**
לַֽה׳ הַיְשׁוּעָ֑ה עַֽל־עַמְּךָ֖ בִרְכָתֶ֣ךָ סֶּֽלָה׃ {פ}
“לַֽה׳ הַיְשׁוּעָה; עַל־עַמְּךָ בִרְכָתֶךָ, סֶּלָה” (“To YHWH belongs deliverance; upon Your people, Your blessing. Selah”). The closing line is a nominal sentence—no verb—stating what is always true: deliverance is God’s property. It is not a loan granted by circumstance or numbers; it is YHWH’s. The inclusio is complete: what the opponents denied (“no deliverance in God”) becomes a general axiom.
The pronouns shift. Up to now, the prayer has been first-person singular: my foes, my voice, my head. Now it is second-person and plural: “Your people” (עַמְּךָ), “Your blessing” (בִרְכָתֶךָ). The personal drama becomes a corporate benediction. Radak hears the battlefield concern: “that Your people may not perish in this war.” Liturgy hears still more: every community that recites these words claims the blessing that follows the confession. This movement from “I” to “we” is one reason the verse is so liturgically portable, appearing from the morning praises to Havdalah.
Selah closes the psalm, as if the congregation should sit a moment in the balance of assertion (“To YHWH belongs deliverance”) and intercession (“upon Your people, Your blessing”). It is a fitting end for a poem that moved from analysis to enactment to axiom: from “How many” to “I slept” to “To YHWH belongs deliverance.” The last word is blessing, and it falls not only on the king but on the people who have learned to say his prayer.
