# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 3

What works: The draft reads the psalm as an argument staged through its form. It rightly locates the hinge at verse 4 (“But You”) and sees the bodily candor of verse 6 (sleeping under siege) as the psalm’s most persuasive “proof” of trust. It highlights the inclusio between the enemies’ “no deliverance in God” (v. 3) and the finale “To YHWH belongs deliverance” (v. 9), and notes the verbal play between the enemies “rising” (v. 2) and the plea “Rise, LORD” (v. 8). The draft is also strong on liturgical reception, especially the Bedtime Shema and Yom Kippur contexts.

What needs work: 
- Overstatement sometimes substitutes for argument; a few claims would benefit from tighter textual proof (e.g., what exactly the preposition ב in v. 3 contributes). 
- Some philology is asserted without showing the Hebrew. The audience can handle—and welcomes—seeing key words and constructions. 
- The phonetic comments are sometimes gratuitous. Limit sound analysis to moments that matter for sense or emphasis. 
- A few missed opportunities: (1) the function of לְנַפְשִׁי (v. 3) as “about me” rather than “to me,” with parallels; (2) “shield around me” (מָגֵן בַּעֲדִי) as an answer to “they set themselves around me” (סָבִיב שָׁתוּ, v. 7) with Psalm 125:2 as an illuminating comparison; (3) the idiom “lift the head” (מֵרִים רֹאשִׁי) and its rare but telling use (Ps 110:7); (4) the prophetic-perfect explanation of v. 8 using traditional sources; (5) explicit figurative parallels for “break the teeth” (Job 29:17; Psalm 58:7). 
- The liturgical section is good but can be cleaner structurally: brief subheadings, Hebrew snippets from the prayers themselves, and a note on how the liturgy re-reads the psalm.

Actionable revisions:
- Define terms for lay readers (colon, inclusio, anaphora, prophetic perfect, Hiphil participle).
- Tether each interpretive claim to Hebrew evidence; quote concisely.
- Bring in specific cross-texts for the cheek/teeth imagery and “holy mountain.”
- Tighten the prosody notes to moments where sound supports sense.
- Reorganize the liturgical use under clear subheadings, quoting both the psalmic phrase and its prayer context in Hebrew with translation.

Figurative language: There are good instincts, but the commentary should explicitly cite parallels (e.g., Ps 58:7; Job 29:17; Lam 3:30; Mic 5:1) and show how Psalm 3’s deployment is distinctive: humiliation and disarming via cheek/teeth as the offensive counterpart to v. 4’s protective shield and lifted head.
