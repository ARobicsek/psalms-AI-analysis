# Introduction Essay: Psalm 3

Psalm 3 opens with a father in flight from his son. The superscription anchors the poem in the Absalom rebellion narrative (2 Samuel 15-18), when David fled Jerusalem as his own child led an army against him. The historical marker invites us to read the psalm as a royal lament—but the artistry of the composition transforms personal catastrophe into theological argument. The macro thesis proposes that Psalm 3 dramatizes an "epistemological conflict between human assessment and divine reality," structuring David's journey from overwhelming crisis to defiant confidence as a rebuttal to the enemies' taunt: "There is no deliverance for him through God" (v. 3). This reading holds, but requires sharpening. The psalm is not simply about competing truth-claims; it is about embodied trust that renders enemy mockery absurd. The radical centerpiece of this psalm is verse 6: "I lay down and slept; I awoke, for the LORD sustains me." This is not metaphor or hyperbole—it is testimony to an impossible act. Sleep amid encirclement becomes the psalm's most devastating theological argument.

The opening verses establish numerical impossibility. The fourfold repetition of the root *rbb* (רבב)—"How many (*mah-rabbu*, מה־רבו) are my foes; *many* (*rabbim*, רבים) rise against me; *many* (*rabbim*, רבים) say of me"—creates a rhetorical crescendo of overwhelming threat (vv. 2-3). This is not incidental word choice. As Radak notes, "many of the wise ones of Israel, as Ahithophel and others," had turned against David, interpreting his punishment for the Bathsheba affair as evidence that God had abandoned him. The enemies' taunt—"*ein yeshu'atah lo be-Elohim*" (אין ישועתה לו באלהים)—is loaded with theological precision. They use the generic divine name *Elohim* (אלהים), not the covenant name *YHWH* (יהוה), suggesting they view God as a distant, abstract force rather than Israel's covenant partner. More crucially, the prepositional phrase *be-Elohim* (באלהים) means "through God" or "in God," asserting that God is not merely absent but *impotent*—unable or unwilling to act on David's behalf. Ibn Ezra notes the gender anomaly of *yeshu'atah* (ישועתה) with its feminine ending, a phonetic marker that draws attention to the noun's formal construction even as the content denies its possibility. The enemies are not merely predicting defeat; they are pronouncing God's irrelevance.

The pivotal adversative *we-attah* (ואתה, "But You") at the opening of verse 4 introduces the sharpest possible reversal. The emphatic independent pronoun—*You*, in contrast to what *they* say—launches a triple identification of God using covenant language and body imagery. First, God is *magen ba'adi* (מגן בעדי), "a shield *about* me" or "around me." The preposition *ba'ad* (בעד) is crucial: this is not a shield merely held in the hand, but an encompassing protective presence. The phrase directly answers the enemies' *saviv shatu alai* (סביב שתו עלי, v. 7), "they have set themselves around against me"—competing encirclements, hostile versus protective. Second, God is *kevodi* (כבודי), "my glory." This syntactic puzzle has generated extensive commentary. Is God *himself* the psalmist's glory (apposition), or does God *restore* the psalmist's honor (causation)? The Metzudat David reads it as restoration: God "upholds my honor" (*tomekh kevodi*, תומך כבודי). Either way, the claim is audacious: against accusations of divine abandonment, David asserts that God *is* his honor or God *gives* him honor—the two readings collapse into a single theological reality. Third, God is *merim roshi* (מרים ראשי), "the one who lifts my head." This idiom of restored dignity (cf. Psalm 110:7) reverses the shame of flight and directly contradicts the posture of a defeated king.

The testimony of verses 5-6 grounds present confidence in past experience of divine response. "My voice to the LORD I cry (*ekra*, אקרא), and He answers me (*vaya'aneni*, ויענני) from His holy mountain" (v. 5). The perfect verb *vaya'aneni* uses past tense to describe future certainty—a prophetic perfect, as Radak suggests, where "the Holy Spirit made a revelation upon his tongue." The spatial theology here is startling: David has *fled from* Jerusalem, yet God answers *from* His holy mountain (Zion/the temple mount). This creates productive tension between physical location and theological reality. God's presence is not bound to geography. Then comes the psalm's most defiant gesture: "*Ani shakhavti va-ishanah; hekitzoti, ki YHWH yismekheni*" (אני שכבתי ואישנה הקיצותי כי יהוה יסמכני)—"I lay down and slept; I awoke, for the LORD sustains me" (v. 6). This is shocking in context. Military encirclement should produce sleepless vigilance. Yet David testifies to a complete sleep cycle: lying down, sleeping, waking. Rashi interprets this psychologically—"my heart was clogged from worry and fear," yet "I awoke from my worry because I trusted"—but this reading undersells the poem's force. Sleep here is not escapism but *enactment*. The body itself becomes argument: by sleeping, David demonstrates that the enemies' theological claim is false. If God truly provides no deliverance, sleep would be impossible. The verb *yismekheni* (יסמכני) from the root *smk* (סמך), meaning "sustain" or "support," carries connotations of reliable upholding. This is not mere emotional reassurance but physical sustenance through vulnerability.

The numerical escalation of verse 7 reveals the psalm's rhetorical genius. After establishing confidence through the sleep testimony, the psalmist *intensifies* the threat: "*Lo-ira me-rivvot am*" (לא־אירא מרבבות עם)—"I will not fear the *myriads* (*rivvot*, רבבות) of people." The root *rbb* appears for a fifth time, but now in its superlative form: not just "many" but "tens of thousands." The odds have grown worse, yet fear has vanished. This paradox—threat escalates while confidence increases—is the psalm's central achievement. Traditional interpretation struggles here. Ibn Ezra offers an allegorical reading about one's *mazal* (fortune) falling and rising, but the plain sense is more powerful: the more impossible the situation becomes by human reckoning, the more absurd the enemies' claim appears. If deliverance depended on numerical superiority or military advantage, David would be doomed. But because deliverance belongs to *YHWH*, numbers are irrelevant.

The petition of verse 8 employs body imagery in reverse: "*Kumah YHWH, hoshi'eni Elohai; ki hikita et-kol-oyevai lechi, shinei resha'im shibarta*" (קומה יהוה הושיעני אלהי כי־הכית את־כל־אויבי לחי שני רשעים שברת)—"Rise, O LORD! Deliver me, O my God! For You strike all my enemies on the cheek; You break the teeth of the wicked." The imperative *kumah* (קומה, "rise") uses the same root (*qum*, קום) as the enemies' *kamim alai* (קמים עלי, "rising against me," v. 2)—a verbal irony where the psalmist redirects the language of aggression toward divine intervention. The body parts—cheek (*lechi*, לחי) and teeth (*shinei*, שני)—reverse the protective body imagery of verse 4. Now we move from shield and lifted head to judicial humiliation and disarmament. Striking the cheek is a gesture of disgrace (cf. Lamentations 3:30, Micah 5:1), and breaking teeth is the silencing of predators. Rashi notes that Ahithophel, David's betraying counselor, was found "strangled" (*vayeḥanak*, ויחנק, 2 Sam 17:23)—a "sickness of the mouth" (*makat ha-peh*, מכת הפה)—linking the broken teeth to actual historical defeat. The perfect verbs (*hikita*, הכית, "You struck"; *shibarta*, שברת, "You broke") are best read as prophetic perfects: God's future victory is so certain that it is narrated as accomplished fact.

The closing verse transforms individual petition into universal principle: "*La-YHWH ha-yeshu'ah; al-ammekha virkatekha selah*" (ליהוה הישועה על־עמך ברכתך סלה)—"To the LORD belongs deliverance; Your blessing be upon Your people" (v. 9). This nominal sentence lacks a verb, creating a timeless theological claim. Deliverance (*yeshu'ah*, ישועה) is not something God *might* provide; it is something that *belongs* to God by nature. The phrase forms an inclusio with verse 3's denial, creating a theological envelope: the enemies say "no deliverance *through* God" (*ein yeshu'atah lo be-Elohim*); David concludes "deliverance *belongs to* the LORD" (*la-YHWH ha-yeshu'ah*). The shift from first-person singular ("me/my") to second-person plural ("Your people") signals the psalm's liturgical trajectory—from individual lament to communal confession.

What earned this psalm its canonical place? Its theological realism. Psalm 3 does not deny overwhelming odds or minimize threat—it acknowledges enemies multiply and surround. But it insists that human assessment of probability is theologically irrelevant. The psalm's innovation is making *sleep*—that most vulnerable, passive state—into the decisive proof of divine presence. By sleeping, David performatively refutes his enemies' metaphysics. The body becomes witness. This is why Jewish liturgy places Psalm 3 in the *Kriat Shema al HaMitah* (Bedtime Shema), where verses 2-9 are recited before sleep as protective prayer. The tradition grasped the psalm's genius: trust is not primarily cognitive assent but embodied practice. The act of lying down to sleep, when enemies still surround, enacts the confidence the psalm declares.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

Psalm 3 appears with remarkable frequency across Jewish liturgy, functioning both as a complete recitation and as a source for extracted phrases. The full psalm (verses 2-9) is recited nightly in the *Kriat Shema al HaMitah* (Bedtime Shema) in both Ashkenazic and Sefardic traditions, following Psalm 91 and protective blessings. This placement brilliantly exploits the psalm's central theme: the vulnerable act of sleep becomes the liturgical moment to recite David's testimony of divine protection during sleep amid siege. The tradition reads the psalm's pshat as directly applicable to nightly repose.

Individual verses serve diverse liturgical functions. The climactic declaration "*La-YHWH ha-yeshu'ah; al-ammekha virkatekha*" (ליהוה הישועה על־עמך ברכתך, "To the LORD belongs deliverance; Your blessing be upon Your people," v. 9) appears in the *Hodu* section of *Pesukei Dezimra* (morning praise), framed by Psalm 94:1 and Psalm 46:12, creating a composite affirmation of divine salvation and protection. This same phrase recurs in *Havdalah* (the Saturday night ceremony ending Shabbat) and in the *Selichot* for *Ta'anit Esther*, demonstrating its liturgical versatility as both celebratory conclusion and penitential petition. The liturgy has universalized the phrase: what was David's personal confession becomes Israel's communal hope.

More specifically, verse 7's declaration of fearlessness—"*Lo-ira me-rivvot am asher saviv shatu alai*" (לֹא־אִירָא מֵרִבְבוֹת עָם אֲשֶׁר סָבִיב שָׁתוּ עָלַי, "I am not afraid of the myriads of people who surround me")—appears in the *Birkhot HaShachar* (morning blessings) of the Edot HaMizrach tradition, embedded within a biblical composite: "*Asichah ve-ehemeh vayishma koli; be-ran yachad kokhevei voker vayari'u kol-benei Elohim; lo-ira me-rivvot am asher saviv shatu alai; va-ani ba-Adonai atzappeh ochilah le-Elohei yish'i*" (I will speak and moan and He heard my voice; the stars together sang and all the sons of God shouted; I am not afraid of myriads who surround me; and I in the LORD will hope). This liturgical recontextualization reads the verse as a threshold declaration—establishing fearlessness before entering formal prayer.

On Yom Kippur, Psalms 1-4 (including all of Psalm 3) are recited as introductory supplements in both Ashkenazic and Edot HaMizrach rites, preceding *Shir HaYichud* and *Anim Zemirot* during *Maariv*. The placement is theologically resonant: on the Day of Atonement, when Israel faces divine judgment, the liturgy positions David's psalm of trust amid hostile encirclement as the spiritual preparation for supplication. The *Neilah* service (Yom Kippur's closing) incorporates verse 4—"*Ve-attah YHWH magen ba'adi*" (ואתה יהוה מגן בעדי, "And You, O LORD, are a shield about me")—into the *Kedushat HaYom*, petitioning God's protective presence precisely when the gates of repentance are sealing.

The liturgical reception thus tracks closely with the psalm's pshat: sleep protection for the *Kriat Shema*, universal divine deliverance for *Pesukei Dezimra*, and covenantal trust for Yom Kippur. Yet the recontextualizations also radicalize meaning—what David experienced in singular historical crisis becomes the ongoing existential condition of Israel, surrounded by threats, sleeping vulnerably, yet sustained by divine presence. The liturgy has made David's impossible sleep the paradigm for Jewish existence.
