Psalm 3 is small-scale drama with a wide horizon. Its superscription ties it to a particular catastrophe—David fleeing his son Absalom (2 Samuel 15–18)—but the poem’s craft turns a family crisis into a public theology. The plot is simple: there is a surge of adversaries (“How many are my foes,” מָה־רַבּוּ צָרַי, v. 2), a taunt that nullifies God’s relevance (“No deliverance for him in God,” אֵין יְשׁוּעָתָה לּוֹ בֵאלֹהִים, v. 3), a sharp reversal (“But You, LORD,” וְאַתָּה יְהוָה, v. 4), and a closing confession whose grammar is timeless: “To YHWH belongs deliverance” (לַיהוָה הַיְשׁוּעָה, v. 9). The poem is a refutation not by logic but by life: the psalmist lies down to sleep and wakes (v. 6). That ordinary cycle—bed, sleep, morning—becomes the decisive counter-argument to “no deliverance.”

The poet builds the threat with anaphora (a deliberate repetition): “How many … many … many” (מָה־רַבּוּ … רַבִּים … רַבִּים, vv. 2–3), culminating later in the superlative “myriads” (רִבְבוֹת, v. 7). Equally important is the voice of the opponents in v. 3. The phrase “Many say of my life/self” (רַבִּים אֹמְרִים לְנַפְשִׁי) likely means “about me,” not “to me.” The preposition לְ with “soul/life” can bear that sense, as in “Pharaoh will say concerning (לְ) the Israelites” (Exodus 14:3). Their verdict is precise: “no deliverance for him in God” (אֵין יְשׁוּעָתָה לּוֹ בֵאלֹהִים). The preposition ב (in/through) can indicate means as well as sphere; they deny that God is either the arena or instrument of rescue. They also avoid the covenant name YHWH (יהוה), choosing the more generic Elohim (אֱלֹהִים). In a poem that will overwhelmingly say “YHWH,” that choice betrays their theology: God, for them, is an abstraction—“God”—not a partner bound to Israel.

Verse 4’s opening, “But You, YHWH” (וְאַתָּה יְהוָה), is the hinge. Three images follow, and they map a person’s restoration from circumference to center. First, “a shield around me” (מָגֵן בַּעֲדִי). The preposition בַּעַד can mean “on behalf of” but also “around,” as when one is shut “behind/within” doors. Here the sense is encirclement—God as a perimeter. This answers the later line “they have set themselves around me” (סָבִיב שָׁתוּ עָלַי, v. 7). There are competing rings: hostile encirclement versus protective encirclement. Psalm 125:2 makes the same point with topography: “Jerusalem—hills surround her; and YHWH surrounds His people” (יְרוּשָׁלַ‍ִם הָרִים סָבִיב לָהּ וַיהוָה סָבִיב לְעַמּוֹ). Second, “my glory” (כְּבוֹדִי). The noun can mean “honor,” but it also leans toward the inner self (“my glory rejoices,” Psalm 16:9). Medievals split here: is God the psalmist’s honor, or the One who restores it? Either way, the thrust is dignity recovered. Third, “the lifter of my head” (וּמֵרִים רֹאשִׁי). The idiom is rare and resonant (cf. Psalm 110:7): a bowed head rises.

The testimony that follows gets at the psalm’s theology of place and time. “My voice—I call to YHWH, and He answers me from His holy mountain” (ק֭וֹלִי אֶל־יְהוָה אֶקְרָא וַיַּעֲנֵנִי מֵהַר קׇדְשׁוֹ, v. 5). The superscription says David is fleeing Jerusalem; verse 5 says the answer comes “from His holy mountain,” Zion. Either the poet is simply naming God’s dwelling (Zion, where the ark rests), or he is quietly insisting that God’s presence answers from Zion even when the king is beyond Zion’s borders. Space does not limit this God. The verb “He answered” (וַיַּעֲנֵנִי) is in the past; grammarians call this a “prophetic perfect,” a way of speaking about the certain future as if it has already occurred. Traditional commentators put it more simply: David is so sure of the answer that he speaks of it as done.

Then, unexpectedly, this warrior lays down: “I lie down and sleep; I wake, for YHWH sustains me” (אֲנִי שָׁכַבְתִּי וָאִישָׁנָה הֱקִיצוֹתִי כִּי יְהוָה יִסְמְכֵנִי, v. 6). Sleep often means death in the Psalms (e.g., Psalm 13:4: “lest I sleep the sleep of death,” פֶּן־אִישַׁן הַמָּוֶת) or trust (Psalm 4:9: “In peace I will lie down and sleep”). Here it is neither metaphor nor aspiration: it is report. In a night when Ahithophel is counseling immediate attack (2 Samuel 17:1–4), the psalmist lies down. The verb “sustain” (סמך) is physical as much as emotional (cf. Psalm 145:14: “YHWH supports [סוֹמֵךְ] all who fall”). The body sleeping under siege is the poem’s rebuttal of the taunt. If there were “no deliverance in God,” sleep would be impossible.

Paradoxically, the threat now intensifies precisely when the fear disappears: “I will not fear the myriads of people” (לֹא־אִירָא מֵרִבְבוֹת עָם, v. 7). The root ר־ב־ב (“many”) that began the poem returns in superlative form. The encirclement is literal—“they have set themselves around me” (סָבִיב שָׁתוּ עָלַי)—but encirclement has already been countered by “shield around me” (מָגֵן בַּעֲדִי). The poem refuses arithmetic. It is not that the enemies are few—it is that numbers do not matter when deliverance “belongs to YHWH.”

So the king prays for God to “rise” (ק֘וּמָה יְהוָה … הוֹשִׁיעֵנִי, v. 8), repurposing the enemy’s verb: they “rise against me” (קָמִים עָלַי, v. 2), therefore—rise against them. The second half of v. 8 is violent and vivid: cheeks struck, teeth broken—humiliation and disarming. “Striking the cheek” signals shame (Lamentations 3:30; Micah 5:1), and “breaking teeth” silences the devouring mouth (Job 29:17: “I broke the fangs of the unrighteous”; cf. Psalm 58:7: “O God, break their teeth in their mouth”). The verbs are again in the past (“You struck,” הִכִּיתָ; “You broke,” שִׁבַּרְתָּ), the prophetic-perfect grammar of faith. The body language of verse 4 (shield, lifted head) is mirrored here by the enemies’ face and teeth; protection and honor for the psalmist become disgrace and disarmament for the wicked.

The finale is elegantly spare: “To YHWH belongs deliverance; upon Your people, Your blessing, Selah” (לַיהוָה הַיְשׁוּעָה עַל־עַמְּךָ בִרְכָתֶךָ סֶלָה, v. 9). Grammatically it is a nominal sentence (no verb), a timeless axiom. The inclusio is complete: the first speech claims “no deliverance in God” (v. 3); the last line announces “deliverance belongs to YHWH.” And the psalm that began in the singular (my foes, my voice, my head) ends in the plural: “Your people.” The movement from “me” to “us” is the psalm’s most important act of publicness. What happens to the king becomes the community’s hope.

Technical notes for this essay: a “colon” is a single poetic line within a verse; “inclusio” is a framing device that repeats a term or theme at the start and close; “anaphora” is deliberate repetition of a word or phrase; a “prophetic perfect” is a past-tense form used to express certain future; a “Hiphil participle” is a Hebrew verb form that often indicates causation (e.g., “the lifter,” מֵרִים, “the one who causes the head to lift”).

The poem’s durability in Jewish prayer reflects precisely this turn toward the body and the night. In the Bedtime Shema, Psalm 3 is an answerable prayer—one sleeps after saying it. On Yom Kippur evening, it is a posture: assailed yet defended, guilty but not godless, asking that the “blessing be upon Your people.”

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

#### Full psalm

In the Bedtime Shema (Kriat Shema al ha‑Mitah) both Ashkenazic and Sefardi rites include Psalm 3 substantially in full (typically vv. 2–9), precisely where one prepares to sleep under God’s guard. The juxtaposition with Psalm 91 (“He will command His angels concerning you”) turns David’s sleep under siege into a nightly practice of trust.

Several rites also place Psalm 3 within psalm clusters at Yom Kippur Maariv (e.g., Psalms 1–4), a contemplative prelude before the body of the service. The poem’s arc—from encirclement to confidence—fits the day’s spiritual labor.

#### Key verses

Psalm 3:7: לֹֽא־אִירָא מֵרִבְבוֹת עָם אֲשֶׁר סָבִיב שָׁתוּ עָלָי (“I will not fear the myriads of people who surround me”). In Edot HaMizrach, this verse is embedded among the morning preliminaries (Birkhot ha‑Shachar) in a biblical collage that strengthens the heart before prayer: “לֹא־אִירָא מֵרִבְבוֹת עָם… וַאֲנִי בַּיהוָה אֲצַפֶּה” (“I will not fear … and I in the LORD will hope”). The placement makes the psalm’s fearlessness a threshold stance.

Psalm 3:9: לַֽיהוָה הַיְשׁוּעָה עַל־עַמְּךָ בִרְכָתֶךָ סֶּלָה (“To YHWH belongs deliverance; Your blessing be upon Your people, Selah”). This line appears in Pesukei de‑Zimra’s Hodu sequence (Shacharit) alongside verses of divine aid: “לַיהוָה הַיְשׁוּעָה … יְהוָה צְבָאוֹת עִמָּנוּ” (“To the LORD belongs deliverance … the LORD of Hosts is with us”). It also punctuates Havdalah’s opening verses on Saturday night, when one reenters the week proclaiming that salvation is God’s. In Selichot for fasts (e.g., Ta’anit Esther), the same line voices corporate hope in a penitential key.

#### Phrases

Psalm 3:4: וְאַתָּה יְהוָה מָגֵן בַּעֲדִי (“But You, LORD, are a shield around me”). In Ashkenazi Neilah (Yom Kippur’s close), some versions weave this confession into Kedushat ha‑Yom’s petitions: “וְאַתָּה יְהוָה מָגֵן בַּעֲדִי … אֵל מֶלֶךְ יוֹשֵׁב עַל כִּסֵּא רַחֲמִים” (“And You, O LORD, are a shield around me … God, King, seated on a throne of mercy”). The phrase personalizes the last appeal before the gates close.

Psalm 3:8: שִׁנֵּי רְשָׁעִים שִׁבַּרְתָּ (“You broke the teeth of the wicked”). While not a common direct recitation, the imagery appears in piyyutim (liturgical poems) adapted for penitential days, where the idiom of disarming the devourer becomes a metaphor for divine vindication: “שִׁנֵּי רְשָׁעִים בֶּחָצָץ תִּגְרוֹס” (“Grind the teeth of the wicked in the gravel”). Liturgy thus preserves the psalm’s bite while redirecting it toward moral enemies.

The liturgical uses move with the psalm’s pshat (plain sense): bedtime recitation leans into v. 6’s embodied trust; festival and fast-day settings amplify v. 9’s public benediction. In each case, private courage becomes communal prayer.
