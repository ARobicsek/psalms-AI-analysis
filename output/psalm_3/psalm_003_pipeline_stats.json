      "Why does v. 4 use כְּבוֹדִי ('my glory') with possessive suffix? Is this theological identification (God = my glory) or restoration claim (God restores my honor)? What is the syntactic relationship - apposition or predication?",

      "What is the significance of the geographical paradox between v. 1's superscription (David fleeing FROM Jerusalem) and v. 5's claim that God answers 'from His holy mountain'? Does this assert divine presence transcends temple geography, or is this proleptic anticipation of return?",

      "What is the precise metaphorical import of 'breaking teeth' (שִׁנֵּי שִׁבַּרְתָּ, v. 8) - does this disarm physical threat (biting), silence verbal mockery (speech), or both? How do ANE curse texts and legal contexts illuminate this imagery?",
      "Why do enemies use אֱלֹהִים (generic 'God', v. 3) while the psalmist predominantly uses יְהוָה (covenant name)? Does divine name choice signal theological positioning - abstract deity vs. relational covenant partner?",
      "How does the spatial preposition בַּעֲדִי ('around me', v. 4) relate to the encirclement verb סָבִיב שָׁתוּ ('they set themselves around', v. 7)? Does God's protective encirclement directly answer enemy hostile encirclement?",
      "What explains the dramatic person shift in v. 9 from first-person singular ('I/me/my') throughout vv. 2-8 to second-person reference to 'Your people'? Is this evidence of liturgical adaptation from personal lament to communal worship resource?",
