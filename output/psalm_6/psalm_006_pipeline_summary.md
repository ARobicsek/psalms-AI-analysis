## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (8)

1. What is the specific meaning and significance of 'sheminith' in the superscription, and how does it relate to the psalm's content?
2. How does the theological argument in v. 6 about death and praise function within broader biblical and ANE concepts of Sheol?
3. What triggers the dramatic reversal between v. 8 and v. 9 - is this an oracle of salvation, inner assurance, or liturgical response?
4. How do the Ugaritic parallels for weeping/tears language illuminate the conventional nature of the psalmist's expression versus unique elements?
5. What is the relationship between the implied sin (v. 2), physical illness (vv. 3, 7-8), and enemy opposition (vv. 8, 11) in the psalm's understanding of crisis?
6. How does the verb tense progression (imperatives → descriptions → confident declarations) support the psalm's rhetorical movement?
7. What lexical and semantic connections exist between the psalmist's 'terror' (נִבְהֲלוּ) and the enemies' future 'terror' (וְיִבָּהֲלוּ)?
8. How does this psalm's integration of penitential and confidence motifs compare to other individual laments in the Psalter?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (8)

1. What is the precise meaning and significance of 'שְׁמִינִית' in the superscription, and why does it appear only here and Psalm 12?
2. Why does the psalmist use 'תוֹכִיחֵנִי' (rebuke/prove) rather than a simple word for punishment - what legal/forensic context is implied?
3. What triggers the dramatic reversal between verse 8 and 9 - is this an oracle of salvation, inner assurance, or liturgical response?
4. How does the rare word 'אֻמְלַל' (languishing) relate to similar terms in other biblical texts, and what does it suggest about the nature of the affliction?
5. Why do the psalmist's 'bones' experience 'terror' (נִבְהֲלוּ) - what does this personification of body parts accomplish that other imagery would not?
6. Is the theological argument in verse 6 about death and praise a genuine theological principle or a form of holy manipulation - and what does this suggest about the psalmist's relationship with God?
7. What is the semantic difference between the two pieces of sleeping furniture ('מִטָּה' and 'עֶרֶשׂ') in verse 7, and why does the poet use both?
8. How does 'weeping' become transformed into 'voice' (קוֹל בִּכְיִי) in verse 9, and what does this suggest about the nature of prayer and divine communication?
