# Verse-by-Verse Commentary: Psalm 6

## Verse 1
**Hebrew (punctuated)**: לַמְנַצֵּ֣חַ בִּ֭נְגִינוֹת עַֽל־הַשְּׁמִינִ֗ית; מִזְמ֥וֹר לְדָוִֽד׃

The superscription presents us with one of the Hebrew Bible's most enigmatic musical terms: הַשְּׁמִינִית (*hash-sheminit*, "the eighth"). This technical designation appears in only two psalm superscriptions—here and Psalm 12:1 (though related forms occur in 1 Chronicles 15:21). BDB's lexicon entry acknowledges the uncertainty, noting it is "usually acc. to the eighth key, or on the octave, but wholly dubious." Three interpretive traditions have emerged: (1) an eight-stringed lyre (thus Rashi: "כִּנּוֹר שֶׁל שְׁמוֹנָה נִימִין," a harp of eight strings); (2) a musical mode or octave setting; (3) a tune or melody known as "the eighth."

The term's function in Israelite worship remains opaque, but its rarity suggests specialized temple repertoire. The juxtaposition with בִּנְגִינוֹת (*binginot*, "with stringed instruments") provides a rare window into the psalm's original performance context—this was sung to instrumental accompaniment, specifically strings. The root נגן appears throughout Scripture for skilled musicianship; when Saul is tormented, David וְנִגֵּן בְּיָדוֹ ("played with his hand," 1 Samuel 16:23), using the same verbal root. The liturgical term לַמְנַצֵּ֣חַ (*lamnatseah*, "for the choirmaster" or "to the conductor") appears in 55 psalm superscriptions, marking this as part of the temple's professional musical corpus, directed by a skilled guild of Levitical musicians.

Modern Jewish liturgy preserves the psalm's centrality: the entire eleven verses form the core of Tachanun (תחנון), recited during Nefilat Apayim ("falling on one's face") in weekday morning and afternoon services. The physical posture—seated, head bowed—embodies the psalm's tone of contrition and vulnerability, transforming ancient musical notation into embodied prayer practice.

## Verse 2
**Hebrew (punctuated)**: יְֽהֹוָ֗ה אַל־בְּאַפְּךָ֥ תוֹכִיחֵ֑נִי; וְֽאַל־בַּחֲמָתְךָ֥ תְיַסְּרֵֽנִי׃

The opening petition employs a double negative construction (אַל...וְאַל, *al...ve-al*) that creates emphatic pleading through synonymous parallelism. The verse is perfectly mirrored in Psalm 38:2, verbatim—though Psalm 38 substitutes בְּקֶצְפְּךָ (*bə-qitsʿpəkha*, "in Your wrath") for בְּאַפְּךָ (*bə-ʾappəkha*, "in Your anger"). This lexical substitution reveals the semantic field of divine anger vocabulary: אַף (literally "nose," metonymically "anger"), חֵמָה ("heat, fury"), and קֶצֶף ("wrath") all describe gradations of divine displeasure. The psalmist's plea is not "do not punish me" but "do not punish me *in anger*"—accepting discipline but appealing for mercy to temper it.

The verbal pair תוֹכִיחֵנִי...תְיַסְּרֵנִי (*tokhiḥeni...təyasreni*) is instructive. BDB notes that יכח (Hiphil) means "decide, adjudge, prove, reprove, chide, correct." The verb carries forensic overtones—God as judge rendering verdict. Ibn Ezra observes: "בעבור שמצא ר׳ משה הכהן: אמלל פתח" ("because Rabbi Moses the Priest found *umlal* with pathach"), noting grammatical precision. Radak helpfully glosses: "אם תוכיחני בעוני, אל באפך, רצונו לומר: לאט, כדי שאוכל לסבול" ("If You reprove me for my iniquity, let it not be in Your anger—meaning: gently, so that I may be able to bear it"). The second verb, יסר, appears in Deuteronomy 8:5's covenantal paradigm: "כַּאֲשֶׁר יְיַסֵּר אִישׁ אֶת־בְּנוֹ יְהֹוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ מְיַסְּרֶךָּ" ("as a man disciplines his son, so the LORD your God disciplines you")—establishing discipline as paternal pedagogy, not arbitrary punishment.

Remarkably, this verse appears in Sefardic liturgy during the Priestly Blessing, where the congregation recites: "יְהֹוָה יְהֹוָה, אֵל רַחוּם וְחַנּוּן...יְהֹוָה אַל בְּאַפְּךָ תוֹכִיחֵנִי" ("LORD, LORD, God merciful and gracious...O LORD, do not rebuke me in Your anger"). This juxtaposition—the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy followed immediately by Psalm 6:2—frames the Priestly Blessing within a theology of tempered judgment, where divine favor must navigate human frailty.

## Verse 3
**Hebrew (punctuated)**: חׇנֵּ֥נִי יְהֹוָה֮ כִּ֤י אֻמְלַ֫ל־אָ֥נִי; רְפָאֵ֥נִי יְהֹוָ֑ה כִּ֖י נִבְהֲל֣וּ עֲצָמָֽי׃

The verse pivots from petition to rationale via the causal כִּי (*ki*, "for, because"), repeated twice to structure the dual plea. The Hebrew achieves remarkable compression through ellipsis: the verb "I am" appears only once (אָנִי, *ʾani*) but governs both cola. Each colon follows an identical pattern: imperative + vocative YHWH + causal *ki* + condition. This creates what Alter calls "climactic parallelism"—the second colon intensifies the first by moving from general weakness to specific terror in the bones.

The adjective אֻמְלַל (*ʾumlal*, "languishing, feeble") is rare, appearing only here and in Joel 1:10 (describing crops withering: "שֻׁדַּד שָׂדֶה...אֻמְלַל תִּירוֹשׁ," "the field is devastated...the new wine languishes"). BDB connects it to אמל, "to be weak, languish," and notes the form is a Pual passive participle—the speaker is *being caused to languish* by an external force. Rashi glosses: "נִשְׁחַת וְדַל כֹּחַ...כְּמוֹ הַיְּהוּדִים הָאֲמֵלָלִים דְּעֶזְרָא" ("devastated and poor in strength...like 'the feeble Jews' in Ezra," Nehemiah 3:34), connecting the term to communal vulnerability under oppression. Ibn Ezra clarifies the grammatical puzzle: "אמר כי איננו שם התואר רק הוא חסר כמו ונאשאר אני" ("he said it is not an adjective but rather defective, like 'and I am left'")—treating *ʾumlal* as a verbal adjective rather than a noun.

The request רְפָאֵ֥נִי (*rəfāʾeni*, "heal me") locates the problem in the realm of *illness*, not *ethics*. The verb רפא consistently denotes physical healing throughout Scripture. When Abimelech's household suffers closed wombs, "וַיִּרְפָּא אֱלֹהִים אֶת־אֲבִימֶלֶךְ" ("and God healed Abimelech," Genesis 20:17). Miriam's leprosy requires Moses's cry: "אֵל נָא רְפָא נָא לָהּ" ("O God, please heal her," Numbers 12:13). The psalmist's framework is medical crisis, not moral guilt—a point reinforced by נִבְהֲל֣וּ עֲצָמָֽי (*nivhalu ʿatsamai*, "my bones are terrified").

This terror-in-bones motif introduces the psalm's central root: בהל (*bhl*). Here the verb appears in Niphal (נִבְהֲלוּ, *nivhalu*), conveying intransitive passivity: the bones *have been terrified* or *are in dismay*. BDB's extensive entry shows בהל can mean "be disturbed, dismayed, terrified," and cites Exodus 15:15 (after the Sea splitting): "אָז נִבְהֲלוּ אַלּוּפֵי אֱדוֹם" ("then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed"). Bones (עֲצָמִים, *ʿatsamim*) function as synecdoche for the body's deepest structure—not surface suffering but foundational collapse. Job uses identical imagery: "עַצְמִי דָבְקָה בְּעוֹרִי וּבִבְשָׂרִי" ("my bones cling to my skin and flesh," Job 19:20). Radak notes: "אמר: עצמי שהם יסוד הגוף" ("he said: 'my bones'—for they are the foundation of the body").

Modern liturgy preserves this medical-theological nexus. In Sefardic Slichot for the first Monday of the penitential period, the congregation recites: "זַעַף נִשָּׂא וַתַּשׁ כֹּחֵנוּ. יְהֹוָה אַל בְּאַפְּךָ תוֹכִיחֵנוּ: חַלְחָלוֹת רַבּוֹת בִּלּוּ בְשָׂרֵנוּ. נָא אַל בַּחֲמָתְךָ תְּיַסְּרֵנוּ" ("Wrath has been kindled and consumed our strength. O LORD, do not rebuke us in Your anger; trembling has worn away our flesh; we beseech You, do not chastise us in Your wrath"). The liturgical expansion from bones to flesh universalizes the psalmist's physical terror into communal affliction, establishing Psalm 6 as the paradigmatic Tachanun text for articulating collective vulnerability before the Day of Judgment.

## Verse 4
**Hebrew (punctuated)**: וְ֭נַפְשִׁי נִבְהֲלָ֣ה מְאֹ֑ד; [וְאַתָּ֥ה] יְ֝הֹוָ֗ה עַד־מָתָֽי׃

The verse achieves escalation through repetition-with-intensification. The terror (בהל) that seized the bones (v. 3) now grips the נֶפֶשׁ (*nefesh*, "soul/life-force"), amplified by מְאֹד (*məʾod*, "exceedingly"). Hebrew poetry characteristically uses body parts as metonymy for the whole person, but here the progression is deliberate: from עֲצָמִים (skeletal depth) to נֶפֶשׁ (animating principle). Radak explicates: "עצמי נבהלו ונפשי נבהלה מאד לפחדי ולדאגתי שאמות מזה החלי" ("my bones are vexed and my soul also is sore vexed with respect to my fear and anxiety that I shall die from this sickness"). The soul's terror is *greater than* the bones'—signaled by מְאֹד—because it perceives the existential threat.

The verse's second colon is syntactically *incomplete*: "וְאַתָּ֥ה יְהֹוָה עַד־מָתָי" (*wə-ʾattah YHWH ʿad-matai*, "and You, O LORD—how long?"). The expected verb is absent. The Masoretic Kethiv reads ואת (*wə-ʾat*) without the ה, while the Qere supplies the full form: וְאַתָּה (*wə-ʾattah*, "and You"). Radak notes: "וְאַתָּ כתיב בלא ה״א וקרי בה״א; ואחד הוא" ("ואת is written without he, but to be read with he—but it is without significance"). This textual variation likely reflects scribal practice rather than semantic difference, but the omission of a governing verb is rhetorically brilliant. The psalmist's desperation has *outrun grammar itself*. What verb would complete the cry? "How long will You be angry?" "How long will You delay?" "How long will I suffer?" All are implied; none is stated. The broken syntax *enacts* the speaker's inability to articulate anguish coherently.

The formula עַד־מָתַי (*ʿad-matai*, "how long?") recurs as the signature question of biblical lament, appearing in Psalms 13:2-3 (four times!), 74:10, 80:5, 89:47, 94:3, and Habakkuk 1:2. In Psalm 13, the prophet layers the questions: "עַד־אָנָה יְהֹוָה תִּשְׁכָּחֵנִי נֶצַח / עַד־אָנָה תַּסְתִּיר אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ מִמֶּנִּי" ("How long, O LORD, will You forget me forever? / How long will You hide Your face from me?"). Here in Psalm 6, the question achieves its most compressed, unanswered form—a raw *shriek* at perceived divine absence. Rashi supplies the implied verb: "תַּבִּיט וְאֵינְךָ רוֹפֵא?" ("will You look on and not heal?"), making explicit what remains grammatically suppressed.

This verse appears in the Sefard Kerovah for Shabbat Zachor, where it is woven into a piyyut structure: "עַד יַשְׁקִיף וְיֵרֶא וְיַקְשֵׁב: וְנֶחֱשַׁבְתִּי כְּעֵד זוֹמֵם. כָּל הַיּוֹם מְדַמֵּם. וְנַפְשִׁי נִבְהֲלָה מְאֹד וּמִשְׁתּוֹמֵם" ("Until He looks down and sees and listens: I am reckoned as a false witness. All day I am troubled. And my soul is greatly troubled and dismayed"). The liturgical context frames the personal terror of Psalm 6 within the communal memory of Amalek's attack—the quintessential threat to Israel's נֶפֶשׁ—transforming the individual's crisis into a paradigm for national endangerment before redemption.

## Verse 5
**Hebrew (punctuated)**: שׁוּבָ֣ה יְ֭הֹוָה חַלְּצָ֣ה נַפְשִׁ֑י; ה֝וֹשִׁיעֵ֗נִי לְמַ֣עַן חַסְדֶּֽךָ׃

Three imperatives drive the verse: שׁוּבָה (*shuvah*, "return!"), חַלְּצָה (*ḥaltsah*, "rescue!"), הוֹשִׁיעֵנִי (*hoshiʿeni*, "save me!"). The first is theologically striking. The verb שׁוב typically describes *human* repentance—"return to the LORD." Here God is commanded to "return" (מֵחֲרוֹנְךָ, "from Your anger," Rashi supplies). The implication: God has *turned away* in wrath; the plea is for divine re-engagement. This bold move appears elsewhere: Psalm 90:13 pleads, "שׁוּבָה יְהֹוָה עַד־מָתָי / וְהִנָּחֵם עַל־עֲבָדֶיךָ" ("Turn, O LORD! How long? / Show mercy to Your servants"). The imperative treats God's anger as a kind of divine *absence*, a withdrawal that must be reversed.

The verb חלץ (Piel: "rescue, deliver") appears 14 times in Psalms, almost always with God as subject. BDB notes its primary sense is "draw off or out, withdraw," originally used for removing sandals (Deuteronomy 25:9). Metaphorically, it means "extract from danger"—God drawing the נֶפֶשׁ out of mortal peril like pulling off a boot. Radak comments: "שוב מחרון אפך עלי, ושוב חלצה נפשי שלא אמות מזה החלי" ("Turn from Thy fierce wrath upon me, and, Turn, deliver my soul that I die not of this sickness"). The final imperative, הוֹשִׁיעֵנִי from the root ישׁע ("save"), is the verb from which יְשׁוּעָה (*yeshuʿah*, "salvation") derives—a term that will dominate prophetic and messianic theology.

But the verse's theological crux lies in its *rationale*: לְמַ֣עַן חַסְדֶּֽךָ (*ləmaʿan ḥasdekha*, "for the sake of Your *chesed*"). Why not appeal to divine צֶדֶק (*tsedeq*, "righteousness") or מִשְׁפָּט (*mishpat*, "justice")? Because the psalmist *cannot claim innocence*. Radak makes this explicit: "לא בצדקתי כי ידעתי כי אני חיה" ("not for my righteousness, for I know that I am guilty"). The term חֶסֶד (*ḥesed*) is notoriously difficult to translate—rendered variously as "loving-kindness," "steadfast love," "covenant loyalty," "mercy." BDB's long entry emphasizes its covenantal character: חֶסֶד operates within a relationship of mutual obligation. The appeal לְמַעַן חַסְדֶּךָ is essentially: "You owe me nothing, but You have bound Yourself to Your people—act according to *that binding*." This is grace theology avant la lettre.

The phrase appears 4 times in Scripture. In Psalm 44:27, after describing national catastrophe, the community prays: "קוּמָֽה עֶזְרָ֣תָה לָּ֑נוּ / וּ֝פְדֵ֗נוּ לְמַ֣עַן חַסְדֶּֽךָ" ("Arise, help us! / Redeem us for the sake of Your steadfast love"). The parallel structure—national crisis appeals to the same covenantal anchor as individual illness—reveals חֶסֶד as Israel's ultimate theological safety net when all other claims fail. Meiri underscores this: "אע״פ שאני מתבונן שהכל ביושר לרוב חטאי אתה אלהי חנני" ("Although I perceive that all is just due to my many sins, You my God, be gracious to me"). The verse thus articulates a *theology of unmerited favor*—God's loyalty to His covenantal character, not to human righteousness, becomes the ground of salvation.

Liturgically, this verse appears in the Slichot for Maariv on Yom Kippur Eve (Edot HaMizrach tradition) within a composite biblical collection, where it follows Psalm 30:4's plea: "חָנֵּ֥נִי יְהֹוָ֗ה...שְׁמַע־יְהֹוָה קוֹלִ֥י אֶקְרָ֗א...שׁוּבָה יְהֹוָה חַלְּצָה נַפְשִׁי" ("Have mercy on me, O LORD...Hear, O LORD, my voice when I call...Return, O LORD, rescue my soul"). This juxtaposition multiplies the cry for divine reversal, establishing Psalm 6:5 as the paradigmatic petition for Divine U-turn on the eve of atonement.

## Verse 6
**Hebrew (punctuated)**: כִּ֤י אֵ֣ין בַּמָּ֣וֶת זִכְרֶ֑ךָ; בִּ֝שְׁא֗וֹל מִ֣י יֽוֹדֶה־לָּֽךְ׃

The verse articulates what scholars call "Sheol theology"—an early Israelite conception where death severs relationship with God. The argument is baldly pragmatic: If I die, You lose my praise. The structure is chiastic: A (no זֵכֶר, "remembrance") / B (in death) :: B' (in Sheol) / A' (no הוֹדָיָה, "thanksgiving"). The causal כִּי (*ki*) makes this the *rationale* for verse 5's plea—save me *because* the dead cannot worship.

The term שְׁאוֹל (*sheʾol*, "Sheol") appears 65 times in the Hebrew Bible, denoting the underworld—not "hell" in the later Christian sense, but a shadowy realm of inactivity. BDB's entry describes it as "the underworld," noting it is "always abs.," without the definite article (except in construct forms like שְׁאוֹל תַּחְתִּית, "lowest Sheol," Deuteronomy 32:22). Isaiah 14:9 personifies it: "שְׁאוֹל מִתַּחַת רָגְזָה לְךָ לִקְרַאת בּוֹאֶךָ" ("Sheol below is stirred up to meet you when you come"). It has "gates" (שַׁעֲרֵי שְׁאוֹל, Isaiah 38:10), "bars" (בְּרִיחֵי שְׁאוֹל, Job 17:16), and "depths" (תַּחְתִּיּוֹת שְׁאוֹל, Psalm 86:13). The figurative language database shows Sheol consistently portrayed as a physical pit or depths from which God must "bring up" (Psalm 30:4: "הֶעֱלִיתָ מִן־שְׁאוֹל נַפְשִׁי," "You brought me up from Sheol").

The verb זָכַר (*zakhar*, "remember") and noun זֵכֶר (*zekher*, "remembrance, memorial") carry covenantal weight. When God "remembers" Noah (Genesis 8:1), the flood subsides. When God "remembers" His covenant with Abraham (Exodus 2:24), the Exodus begins. זֵכֶר is thus not mere *cognitive recall* but *active engagement*. The claim "there is no remembrance of You in death" means the dead cannot *engage* with God in worship and testimony. This is reinforced by the parallel: "בִּשְׁאוֹל מִי יֽוֹדֶה־לָּךְ" (*bisheʾol mi yodeh-lakh*, "in Sheol who will praise You?"). The verb ידה (Hiphil) means "give thanks, praise"—the sacrificial terminology of temple worship. The rhetorical question expects the answer *no one*.

This Sheol theology appears prominently in Hezekiah's psalm (Isaiah 38:18): "כִּי לֹא שְׁאוֹל תּוֹדֶךָּ מָוֶת יְהַלְלֶךָּ / לֹא־יְשַׂבְּרוּ יוֹרְדֵי־בוֹר אֶל־אֲמִתֶּךָ" ("For Sheol cannot praise You, death cannot celebrate You; / those who go down to the Pit cannot hope for Your faithfulness"). Psalm 88:11-12 presses the question further: "הֲלַמֵּתִים תַּעֲשֶׂה־פֶּלֶא...הַיְסֻפַּר בַּקֶּבֶר חַסְדֶּךָ" ("Do You work wonders for the dead?...Is Your steadfast love declared in the grave?"). And Psalm 115:17 declares flatly: "לֹא הַמֵּתִים יְהַלְלוּ־יָהּ" ("The dead do not praise the LORD").

This represents a sharp contrast with neighboring cultures. In Egypt, the afterlife was the *primary* locus of divine encounter—the entire *Book of the Dead* prepares the deceased for judgment and eternal life. In Mesopotamia, the *Descent of Ishtar* describes the underworld as a place of continued (albeit diminished) divine activity. Israel's Sheol theology is *anti-cultic*: there are no temples in Sheol, no sacrifices, no praise. As Mary Douglas notes, "Judaism was conspicuous among the religions of the ancient world in not praying to dead ancestors." God lives in *life*. Heaven, in biblical Israel, is not "life after death" but "life *before* death lived in covenant."

Radak addresses this theology directly: "אם אמות לא אזכרך במות ולא אודה לך; ואם תרפאני אודה לך לעיני כל" ("If I die, I shall not remember Thee in death, neither shall I give Thee thanks; and if Thou healest me, I will give Thee thanks before the eyes of all"). The argument is transactional, yet profoundly relational—God's covenantal character *needs* human witness. The audacity is stunning: the psalmist *leverages God's desire for praise* to argue for deliverance. Meiri nuances this: "אם לא טרח האדם בחיו לעבודת האל אין לו פנאי בזה אחר המות" ("If a person has not labored in his lifetime in the service of God, he has no leisure for it after death"). The verse functions not merely as an argument from Sheol's ontology but as an *incentive structure* for divine mercy.

Liturgically, Psalm 6:6 does not appear independently in standard Jewish prayer, but its theology saturates the High Holiday liturgy. Yom Kippur's U-Netaneh Tokef proclaims: "וְאַתָּה הוּא מֶלֶךְ אֵל חַי וְקַיָּם" ("And You are the King, the living and eternal God"), implicitly contrasting divine eternality with human mortality's praise-silencing power. The verse's pragmatic theology—"save me or lose my worship"—becomes, in liturgical context, an existential plea for the continuation of covenantal relationship itself.

## Verse 7
**Hebrew (punctuated)**: יָגַ֤עְתִּי ׀ בְּֽאַנְחָתִ֗י אַשְׂחֶ֣ה בְכׇל־לַ֭יְלָה מִטָּתִ֑י; בְּ֝דִמְעָתִ֗י עַרְשִׂ֥י אַמְסֶֽה׃

The verse marks the psalm's emotional nadir through hyperbolic water imagery. The opening verb יָגַעְתִּי (*yagaʿti*, from יגע, "to be weary, exhausted") appears elsewhere in contexts of extreme labor: Joshua 24:13 describes land "which you did not labor for" (לֹא־יָגַעְתָּ בָּהּ), and Isaiah 40:31 promises those who wait on the LORD "יָרוּצוּ וְלֹא יִיגָעוּ" ("shall run and not grow weary"). Here the weariness derives *from groaning itself*—בְּאַנְחָתִי (*bəʾanḥati*, "with my sighing"). The root אנח appears in Psalm 31:11: "כָּל֪וּ בְיָג֡וֹן חַיַּי֮ וּשְׁנוֹתַ֢י בַּאֲנָ֫חָ֥ה" ("my life is spent in sorrow, my years in sighing")—linking Psalms 6 and 31 through this shared lexicon of prolonged grief.

The two cola employ parallel hyperbolic verbs. First: אַשְׂחֶה (*ʾasḥeh*, from שׂחה) typically means "swim" but here "I drench" or "I flood." BDB notes the root is found in Isaiah 25:11: "כַּאֲשֶׁר יְפָרֵשׂ הַשֹּׂחֶה לִשְׂחוֹת" ("as the swimmer spreads [his hands] to swim"), and Ezekiel 47:5 describes "מֵי שָׂחוּ" ("water to swim in"). Rashi, however, connects it to defilement: "לְשׁוֹן סְחִי וּמָאוֹס...מְמָאֵס אֲנִי מִטָּתִי בִּדְמָעוֹת" ("an expression of 'scum and refuse'...I sully my bed with tears," citing Lamentations 3:45). Menachem, Rashi notes, associates it with swimming—generating the image of a bed literally swimming in tears. The second verb, אַמְסֶה (*ʾamseh*, from מסה, "melt, dissolve"), intensifies the hyperbole: "I dissolve my couch." BDB defines the Hiphil as "cause to dissolve, melt," citing Psalm 147:18 (God "melts" ice) and Joshua 14:8 (intimidators "melted" the people's hearts). The tears are imagined as so copious they *liquify* furniture.

The temporal marker בְכׇל־לַיְלָה (*bəkhol-laylah*, "every night") suggests ongoing, nocturnal suffering. Night intensifies affliction because communal support vanishes and the sufferer confronts pain in isolation. Radak comments: "כי בלילה יכבד החלי ויאנח האדם ויבכה על חליו. או יבכה בלילה מפני שבני הבית ישנים ואין רואה אותו" ("For at night the sickness is grievous, and a man laments and weeps on account of his sickness. Or he weeps at night because the household is asleep and no one sees him"). The second explanation is psychologically acute: nocturnal weeping occurs in solitude, free from social performance. The night-time lament tradition appears in Lamentations 2:19: "קוּמִי רֹנִּי בַלַּיְלָה" ("Arise, cry out in the night"), and Psalm 42:9 flips it positively: "בַלַּיְלָה שִׁירֹה עִמִּי" ("at night His song is with me").

The synonymous parallelism—מִטָּה (*mittah*, "bed") / עֶרֶשׂ (*ʿeres*, "couch")—is standard Hebrew poetics. Both terms appear together in Proverbs 7:16-17: "רָבַדְתִּי עַרְשִׂי...נַפְתִּי מִשְׁכָּבִי" ("I have spread my couch...I have perfumed my bed"), where they denote the same object. The דִּמְעָה (*dimʿah*, "tear") is the agent of dissolution—a bodily fluid given destructive agency. The root דמע appears only 23 times in Scripture, but its cognate imagery pervades lament: Jeremiah 9:17 commands professional mourners, "וְתֵרַדְנָה עֵינֵינוּ דִּמְעָה" ("let tears stream from our eyes").

This hyperbolic language has ancient Near Eastern parallels. The Ugaritic word pair *bky/dmʿt* (weeping/tears) appears in mourning contexts, establishing it as conventional lament vocabulary. Akkadian laments similarly employ flooding imagery—in *Lamentation over the Destruction of Ur*, the goddess's tears are described as "filling canals." The shared poetics suggest this is not spontaneous emotion but *crafted liturgy* employing traditional hyperbolic conventions to express extremity.

Malbim offers a creative reading: "בכל זאת מן הבכי והדמעות לא עששה עיני, רק עששה מן הכעס עיני" ("Despite all this weeping and tears, my eye was not wasted from weeping but rather wasted from vexation"), parsing the verse as preparation for v. 8's shift to enemies. The nightly tears describe *illness*; the eye-wasting describes *social affliction*—an interpretive move that bifurcates the psalm's two anguishes.

Liturgically, this phrase appears in Edot HaMizrach zemirot for Motza'ei Shabbat (Saturday night post-Havdalah), embedded in the piyyut: "חָלְפָה עוֹנַת מִנְחָתִי, מִי יִתֵּן מְנוּחָתִי, יָגַעְתִּי בְאַנְחָתִי, אַשְׂחֶה בְכָל־לַיְלָה" ("My time of prayer has passed; who will grant me rest? I am weary with my sighing; all night I drench my bed"). The liturgical transformation is striking: the psalmist's medical crisis becomes the soul's *longing for the departed Sabbath*. Motza'ei Shabbat liturgy often employs lament language to express spiritual bereavement—the neshama yeteirah (additional Sabbath soul) departs, leaving the worshipper diminished. Psalm 6:7's nocturnal weeping becomes an apt metaphor for this weekly spiritual mourning ritual.

## Verse 8
**Hebrew (punctuated)**: עָשְׁשָׁ֣ה מִכַּ֣עַס עֵינִ֑י; עָ֝תְקָ֗ה בְּכׇל־צוֹרְרָֽי׃

The verse shifts bodily focus from bones (v. 3) and soul (v. 4) to the eye—the social organ. The verb עָשְׁשָׁה (*ʿasheshah*, from עשׁשׁ) means "wasted, decayed," literally "moth-eaten." BDB cites Isaiah 50:9: "כַּבֶּגֶד יִבְלוּ עָשׁ יֹאכְלֵם" ("like a garment they will wear out; the moth will eat them"). Rashi connects it to עֲשָׁשִׁית, a type of lantern whose light has dimmed: "עַיִן שֶׁמְּאוֹרָהּ כֵּהָה, וְדוֹמֶה לוֹ כְּאִלּוּ הוּא רוֹאֶה דֶּרֶךְ זְכוּכִית" ("an eye whose light has dimmed, and it seems as though he sees through glass"), suggesting impaired vision—the world viewed as through a veil. Menachem, per Rashi, connects it to "רִקָּבוֹן" (decay): "וַעֲצָמַי עָשֵׁשׁוּ" ("and my bones are wasted away," Psalm 31:11). The verb appears only 5 times in Scripture, always describing bodily or material disintegration.

The causal phrase מִכַּעַס (*mikkaʿas*, "from vexation/grief") is crucial. The preposition מִן indicates *source*—the eye decays *because of* כַּעַס. BDB defines כַּעַס as "vexation, anger, grief," noting it can describe human irritation or divine wrath. The term appears 25 times, often paired with provocation: Deuteronomy 32:21 describes Israel making God jealous "בְּכַעֲסֵיהֶם" ("with their vexations"). Here it denotes the psalmist's *distress*—whether anger at his condition or grief over his state. Radak glosses: "מן הכעס שאני כועס על אויבי השמחים לחליי" ("from the vexation with which I am vexed against my enemies, who rejoice at my sickness"). This introduces צוֹרְרַי (*tsorerai*, "my foes")—the *first mention of enemies* in the psalm.

The second verb, עָתְקָה (*ʿateqah*, from עתק), means "moved, aged, worn." BDB's entry shows semantic range from "move forward" to "grow old/feeble." Job 14:18: "וְצוּר יֶעְתַּק מִמְּקֹמוֹ" ("a rock is moved from its place")—implying dislocation. Here the eye has aged prematurely or been displaced. Radak cites the Targum: "שתרגום ישן: עתיק" ("for the Targum of 'old' is *ʿatiq*"), linking it to aging. The verb appears in Proverbs 25:1 for *transcribing* texts: "גַם־אֵלֶּה מִשְׁלֵי שְׁלֹמֹה אֲשֶׁר הֶעְתִּיקוּ אַנְשֵׁי חִזְקִיָּה" ("These also are proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah transcribed")—suggesting *removal* from one state to another. The eye has been *removed* from its proper functioning.

The phrase בְּכׇל־צוֹרְרָֽי (*bəkhol-tsorerai*, "because of all my foes") structurally parallels v. 7's בְכׇל־לַיְלָה (*bəkhol-laylah*, "every night"). Both use the construct כׇּל + definite noun to express comprehensiveness. But *who* are these צוֹרְרִים (*tsorerim*)? The root צרר means "bind, be narrow, be in distress" or as a noun "adversary, foe." The participial form suggests *active agents*—those who *cause* distress. Possibilities include: (1) political enemies (if Davidic); (2) false accusers in a legal context; (3) those mocking the sick (social enemies); (4) cosmic/demonic forces; (5) metaphors for the affliction itself. Radak opts for option 3: "אויבי השמחים לחליי" ("my enemies who rejoice at my sickness"), reading the foes as *Schadenfreude* practitioners. Meiri universalizes: "צוררי...היו אויביו שמחים בחליו" ("his enemies rejoiced in his illness").

The linkage of illness and social antagonism is common in lament psalms. Psalm 35:15-16 describes enemies who mock the afflicted: "בְּצַלְעִי שָׂמְחוּ...חָרְקוּ עָלַי שִׁנֵּימוֹ" ("when I stumbled they rejoiced...they gnashed their teeth at me"). Psalm 41:6-9 portrays visitors who come "with false heart" to gloat over sickness. Job's friends exemplify this complex: ostensibly comforters, they become accusers. The eye's decay מִכַּעַס thus describes not just physical suffering but the *psychological toll* of social isolation during illness—the gaze of mockery literally *consuming* the sufferer's ability to see clearly or be seen honorably.

This verse introduces the psalm's second major theme: enemies. Verses 2-7 focused on God's anger and the psalmist's illness; verse 8 pivots to human antagonists. Malbim reads this structurally: "עתה מתחיל ענין השני נגד אויביו המצערים אותו" ("Now begins the second matter, against his enemies who afflict him"), treating illness and enmity as distinct crises. But the verse's grammar suggests *synthesis*: the wasting eye is *from* vexation (illness) but specifically *in all my foes* (social affliction). The medical and the social intertwine—illness is never merely physiological in the psalm's world; it is always already *socially mediated*.

The figurative language database reveals the "wasted eye" motif appears 12 times in Scripture. Psalm 31:10 uses nearly identical language: "עָשְׁשָׁה בְכַעַס עֵינִי נַפְשִׁי וּבִטְנִי" ("My eye is wasted from grief, my soul and my belly")—creating a strong intertextual link between Psalms 6 and 31 as paired laments of the afflicted-by-enemies. Job 17:7 employs the same verb: "וַתֵּכַהּ מִכַּעַשׂ עֵינִי" ("My eye is dimmed from grief"), reinforcing a conventional lexicon for expressing the somatic effects of sustained anguish. The motif thus functions as *topos*—a standard lament image—even as each occurrence nuances it differently.

## Verse 9
**Hebrew (punctuated)**: ס֣וּרוּ מִ֭מֶּנִּי כׇּל־פֹּ֣עֲלֵי אָ֑וֶן; כִּֽי־שָׁמַ֥ע יְ֝הֹוָ֗ה ק֣וֹל בִּכְיִֽי׃

The imperative סוּרוּ (*suru*, "depart!") marks the psalm's dramatic *tonal shift*. The verb סור (Qal imperative plural) means "turn aside, depart, remove." It is a command of banishment, not negotiation. The addressees—כׇּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן (*kol-poʿalei ʾaven*, "all workers of iniquity")—are a stock phrase in Psalms, appearing 15 times (Psalms 5:6, 6:9, 14:4, 28:3, 36:13, 53:5, 59:3, 64:3, 92:8, 92:10, 94:4, 94:16, 101:8, 125:5, 141:9). The construct פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן literally means "doers of wickedness/trouble"—those whose *work* (פעל) is אָוֶן.

The noun אָוֶן is semantically rich. BDB's entry shows three primary senses: (1) "trouble, sorrow" (Genesis 35:18: "בֶּן־אוֹנִי," "son of my sorrow"); (2) "wickedness" (Job 4:8: "חֹרְשֵׁי אָוֶן," "those who plow wickedness"); (3) "idolatry" (Hosea 12:12: "בֵּית אָוֶן," Bethel as "house of wickedness"). The term appears 83 times, often paired with עָמָל (*ʿamal*, "toil, trouble") to create a hendiadys for comprehensive evil. Psalm 10:7 describes the wicked: "פִּיהוּ מָלֵא אָלָה...תַּחַת לְשׁוֹנוֹ עָמָל וָאָוֶן" ("his mouth is full of cursing...under his tongue are mischief and iniquity"). The "workers of iniquity" phrase thus denotes those whose *profession* is wickedness—habitual, systematic evildoers.

But *who are they*? The psalm never specifies. Options include: (1) political enemies (if the psalm is Davidic); (2) slanderers/false accusers; (3) those mocking the sick; (4) generic "evildoers" as a liturgical category; (5) demonic forces (as in later Jewish interpretation). Radak identifies them with v. 8's צוֹרְרִים: "צורריו הם פועלי און, הפך פעלו" ("His adversaries are workers of iniquity; he reversed his action" [from pleading to commanding]). Ibn Ezra notes the structural reversal: the suppliant *who begged God* now *commands enemies*. This role-reversal signals a fundamental change in the psalmist's status.

The causal כִּי (*ki*, "for, because") introduces the *rationale* for the dismissal: שָׁמַ֥ע יְהֹוָה קוֹל בִּכְיִי (*shamaʿ YHWH qol bikhyi*, "the LORD has heard the sound of my weeping"). The verb שָׁמַע in the perfect tense can denote completed action ("has heard") or prophetic certainty (present/future as already accomplished). The phrase קוֹל בִּכְיִי (*qol bikhyi*, "voice/sound of weeping") is striking: בְּכִי (*bekhi*, "weeping") is given a קוֹל (*qol*, "voice, sound"). Weeping is not inarticulate; it *speaks* to God. The noun בְּכִי appears 30 times, often in contexts of mourning: Genesis 35:8 names "אַלּוֹן בָּכוּת" (*Allon Bakhut*, "Oak of Weeping"), marking Rebekah's nurse's burial. Jeremiah 31:15 describes Rachel's בְּכִי: "רָחֵל מְבַכָּה עַל־בָּנֶיהָ" ("Rachel weeping for her children"). The term's cognate verb בכה (*bakhah*, "weep") can describe audible lamentation (Genesis 45:2: Joseph "וַיִּתֵּן אֶת־קֹלוֹ בִּבְכִי," "gave forth his voice in weeping") or silent tears (Ruth 1:9: "וַתִּשֶּׂנָה קוֹלָן וַתִּבְכֶּינָה," "they lifted up their voice and wept").

The claim that God has "heard" weeping is theologically loaded. "Hearing" in covenantal theology implies *response*, not mere auditory reception. Exodus 2:24 pivots the entire Exodus narrative on divine hearing: "וַיִּשְׁמַע אֱלֹהִים אֶת־נַאֲקָתָם" ("and God heard their groaning"). When Hannah prays silently at Shiloh, Eli thinks her drunk, but God "hears": 1 Samuel 1:20 reports, "וַיְהִי לִתְקֻפוֹת הַיָּמִים...כִּי שְׁאֵלַתְהוּ מֵיְהוָה" ("in due time...for she had asked him of the LORD")—the birth validates the hearing. Radak comments: "בחיותו מחליו אמר זה, או בחליו; ומדבר על העתיד ברוח הקדש" ("He said this on recovering from his sickness, or even during his sickness; and [then] he is speaking of the future by the Holy Spirit")—treating the perfect tense as *prophetic certainty* rather than past report.

But when did this hearing occur? The psalm contains *no theophany*, no divine oracle, no priestly assurance. Many commentators posit a "liturgical gap"—an oracle delivered between verses 8 and 9 that the text does not record. Ancient Near Eastern parallels support this: Mesopotamian laments often include a section where a priest declares divine acceptance. But Psalm 6 offers no such explicit marker. The shift from lament to confidence is *textually abrupt*, creating interpretive space. Was there an inner assurance? A prophetic intuition? A ritual moment (sacrifice accepted)? The text's silence is eloquent—the *certainty of being heard* arrives without explanation, as *gift* rather than *report*.

The sudden tonal shift has led scholars to identify this as an "assurance oracle" pattern. Claus Westermann argued that individual laments follow a structure: (1) invocation, (2) lament, (3) petition, (4) *assurance*, (5) vow of praise. Psalm 6 fits perfectly: vv. 2-5 petition, vv. 6-7 lament, v. 9 assurance, vv. 10-11 confidence. The assurance may derive from: (1) a priestly oracle (now omitted); (2) the psalmist's faith-imagination (treating *petitionary prayer itself* as generative of confidence); (3) liturgical convention (worshippers *knew* this was the turning point). Radak's allowance that "every sick man who prays by this Psalm is able to say this" ("וכל אדם חולה המתפלל בזה המזמור יוכל לומר זה") universalizes the text: *any* sufferer can appropriate this shift, treating the psalm as a *script* for moving from despair to hope.

Liturgically, this verse is central. It appears repeatedly: (1) In Psalm 92:8 context (Song of the Day for Shabbat), where "all workers of iniquity" blossom only to be destroyed; (2) In Psalm 6 Tachanun recitation; (3) In Mizrahi Rosh Hashanah Seder Simanim, where it's used as an invocation: "שֶׁיִּסְתַּלְּקוּ אוֹיְבֶיךָ וְשׂוֹנְאֶיךָ...סוּרוּ מִמֶּנִּי כָּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן" ("May Your enemies and those who hate You depart...Depart from me, all workers of iniquity"). The liturgical use interprets the "workers of iniquity" not as internal adversaries but as *threats to Israel*—nationalizing the personal lament.

## Verse 10
**Hebrew (punctuated)**: שָׁמַ֣ע יְ֭הֹוָה תְּחִנָּתִ֑י; יְ֝הֹוָ֗ה תְּֽפִלָּתִ֥י יִקָּֽח׃

The verse achieves rhetorical intensification through triple repetition of שָׁמַע (*shamaʿ*, "hear/heed"), escalating the objects of divine hearing: (1) קוֹל בִּכְיִי (*qol bikhyi*, v. 9, "sound of weeping"), (2) תְּחִנָּתִי (*təḥinnati*, v. 10a, "my supplication"), (3) תְּפִלָּתִי (*təfillati*, v. 10b, "my prayer"). This progression moves from *inarticulate sound* to *structured petition* to *formal cultic prayer*—suggesting that *all* forms of vocalized distress, from raw weeping to liturgical recitation, constitute valid communication with God. The triple שָׁמַע creates an incantatory effect, rhythmically hammering the assurance of divine attention.

The first noun, תְּחִנָּה (*təḥinnah*, "supplication"), derives from the root חנן (*ḥanan*, "be gracious, show favor"). BDB defines it as "favour, supplication for favour," noting 25 occurrences. The term appears prominently in Solomon's Temple dedication: 1 Kings 8:28 pleads, "וּפָנִיתָ אֶל־תְּפִלַּת עַבְדְּךָ וְאֶל־תְּחִנָּתוֹ" ("Turn to Your servant's prayer and his supplication"). The verb חנן is precisely what the psalmist demanded in v. 3: חָנֵּנִי (*ḥonneni*, "have mercy on me"). תְּחִנָּה is thus the *noun form* of that initial plea—the crystallized appeal for grace. Its semantic range emphasizes *unmerited favor*: one does not petition based on right but on the granter's generosity. This distinguishes it from the next term.

The second noun, תְּפִלָּה (*təfillah*, "prayer"), is from the reflexive-passive stem (Hitpael) of the root פלל (*palal*), whose core meaning is "intervene, interpose, judge." BDB's entry shows its primary use is "prayer" (77 times), but the etymology suggests *self-judgment* or *mediation*. The term denotes formalized, structured prayer—what we would call liturgy. Hannah's prayer at Shiloh is called תְּפִלָּה (1 Samuel 1:27); the Temple becomes "בֵּית תְּפִלָּה" ("house of prayer," Isaiah 56:7). Jeremiah 7:16 warns, "וְאַתָּה אַל־תִּתְפַּלֵּל בְּעַד־הָעָם הַזֶּה" ("As for you, do not pray for this people")—using the verbal form to denote intercession. תְּפִלָּה thus represents not spontaneous outcry but *deliberate, articulated petition*.

The progression קוֹל בִּכְיִי → תְּחִנָּה → תְּפִלָּה maps increasing *articulateness*: (1) raw weeping (pre-verbal), (2) grace-petitioning (semi-structured), (3) formal prayer (fully liturgical). This taxonomy implies God attends to the *entire spectrum* of human distress—from those who cannot yet form words to those reciting prescribed texts. Radak does not elaborate on this progression, treating them as synonyms: "כפל ענין במלות שונות כמנהג הלשון" ("A duplication of the sense in different words in accordance with the idiom of the language"). But the modern reader can discern an implicit theology: *all* vocalized suffering, regardless of eloquence, *counts as prayer*.

The verb יִקָּח (*yiqqaḥ*, "He will receive/accept") is theologically striking. This is not merely "hear" (*shamaʿ*) but *laqach* ("take, receive, accept"). BDB's extensive entry shows *laqach* as "take in the hand," "carry along," "take possession of," but also "receive, accept" (as in Jeremiah 5:3: "לָקַחַת מוּסָר," "receive instruction"). In cultic contexts, the verb describes God *accepting* offerings. Leviticus 1:4: "וְנִרְצָה לוֹ לְכַפֵּר עָלָיו" ("and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement")—the root רצה parallels *laqach* semantically, both denoting divine *reception* of sacrifice. Here prayer is metaphorically treated *as sacrifice*—an offering God can "take" or refuse. This is sacrificial metaphor applied to verbal worship.

The Targum renders this: "ה' צלותי תקבל" ("the LORD will accept my prayer"), using קבל (*qabbal*, Aramaic "receive"), which reinforces the cultic frame. Malbim makes this explicit: "ה' תפלתי יקח הוא מקבל תפלתי כאשר מקבל את המנחה" ("The LORD receives my prayer as He receives the grain offering"). This theology—prayer *as offering*—becomes foundational in post-Temple Judaism. After 70 CE, the rabbis declared תְּפִלָּה replaces קׇרְבָּן (*qorban*, "sacrifice"). Mishnah Berakhot formalizes three daily תְּפִלוֹת corresponding to the twice-daily tamid sacrifices plus an evening voluntary offering. The verb יִקָּח thus anticipates centuries of Jewish liturgical theology.

The divine name יְהֹוָה (*YHWH*) appears *twice* in this single verse—once at the beginning of each colon. This doubles the invocation, creating both repetition (emphasis) and bracket (inclusio). Counting from v. 2 forward, יְהֹוָה appears nine times in ten verses (excluding the superscription), saturating the psalm with the covenantal name. This stands in sharp contrast to Elohistic psalms (e.g., Psalm 42-43, 84), which avoid יְהֹוָה in favor of אֱלֹהִים. The concentration of יְהֹוָה signals this is *covenantal prayer*—appealing not to a generic deity but to the God who bound Himself to Israel at Sinai.

Liturgically, this verse appears in Edot HaMizrach Slichot for Yom Kippur Eve as part of an extended biblical compilation: "שְׁמַע־יְהֹוָה וְחׇנֵּנִי...שְׁמַע־יְהֹוָה קוֹלִי אֶקְרָא...שָׁמַע יְהֹוָה תְּחִנָּתִי יְהֹוָה תְּפִלָּתִי יִקָּח" ("Hear, O LORD, and be gracious...Hear, O LORD, my voice when I call...The LORD has heard my supplication; the LORD receives my prayer"). This liturgical stacking—three "hear" verses in succession—mirrors Psalm 6:9-10's internal triple שָׁמַע, creating a liturgical echo chamber of divine attentiveness. The placement before Yom Kippur's peak confession rituals frames the day's arc: *assurance of hearing* precedes *articulation of sin*.

Meiri reads the verse's perfect tense as *proleptic*: "אמ׳ דרך בטחון באל סורו ממני כל פועלי און...כי שמע ה׳ קול בכיי" ("He spoke with confidence in God: 'Depart from me, all workers of iniquity'...for the LORD has heard the sound of my weeping"). The grammatical *past* expresses theological *future-certainty*—what has not yet occurred is spoken of as accomplished because divine promise makes it inevitable. This is the essence of biblical prophetic speech: the not-yet treated as already-was because God's word guarantees it. In liturgical performance, every reciter of Psalm 6 *inhabits* this proleptic confidence, speaking their own hoped-for deliverance as though *already accomplished*.

## Verse 11
**Hebrew (punctuated)**: יֵבֹ֤שׁוּ ׀ וְיִבָּהֲל֣וּ מְ֭אֹד כׇּל־אֹיְבָ֑י; יָ֝שֻׁ֗בוּ יֵבֹ֥שׁוּ רָֽגַע׃

The psalm's conclusion enacts a stunning chiastic reversal: the *terror* (בהל) that afflicted the psalmist (vv. 3-4: נִבְהֲלוּ עֲצָמָי...נִבְהֲלָה מְאֹד נַפְשִׁי) is now transferred *to the enemies*: וְיִבָּהֲלוּ מְאֹד (*vəyivvahalu məʾod*, "and [they] will be terrified exceedingly"). The verbal form is identical—Niphal imperfect plural of בהל—creating perfect symmetry. A: psalmist's bones terrified (v. 3) / B: psalmist's soul terrified מְאֹד (v. 4) :: B': enemies terrified מְאֹד (v. 11) / A':
