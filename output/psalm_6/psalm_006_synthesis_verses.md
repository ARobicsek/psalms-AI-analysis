# Verse-by-Verse Commentary: Psalm 6

## Verse 1

**לַמְנַצֵּ֥חַ בִּנְגִינ֗וֹת עַֽל־הַשְּׁמִינִ֥ית מִזְמ֥וֹר לְדָוִֽד׃**

The superscription contains the enigmatic term `עַֽל־הַשְּׁמִינִ֥ית` (*ʿal-hash-shmiy-**NIY**-th*), which appears only here and in Psalm 12:1, making it one of the rarest technical terms in the Psalter. The BDB lexicon notes this phrase is "usually acc. to the eighth key, or on the octave, but wholly dubious," reflecting centuries of scholarly uncertainty. Rashi's interpretation—"a harp of eight strings, known as *sheminith*"—represents the mainstream traditional understanding that this refers to a specific musical instrument or tuning. Ibn Ezra offers multiple possibilities: either an eight-stringed instrument, a composition with eight melodies, or music played "on the eighth pleasant [mode]."

The term's rarity creates an interpretive paradox: if this were simply a standard musical instruction, why does it appear so infrequently? The Targum's rendering and various medieval commentaries suggest this was already puzzling to ancient interpreters. Radak's observation that the meaning was uncertain even in his time ("this is distant") points to an early breakdown in the transmission of technical musical knowledge from the Temple period.

The pairing with `בִּנְגִינ֗וֹת` (*bin-ghiy-**NŌTH***) is significant. This term, from the root נגן (to play stringed instruments), appears in several psalm superscriptions and suggests accompaniment by stringed instruments rather than wind or percussion. The combination implies a sophisticated musical arrangement: a psalm intended for stringed accompaniment performed either in the eighth mode or on an eight-stringed instrument.

The liturgical tradition has preserved this mystery intact—in Jewish liturgy, Psalm 6 appears complete with its superscription in the daily *Tachanun* service, where the technical musical terms have become fossilized poetry rather than practical instructions. This transformation from performance direction to sacred text illustrates how the loss of Temple worship converted functional elements into objects of interpretive contemplation, making the superscription itself part of the psalm's theological content.

## Verse 2

**יְהוָ֗ה אַל־בְּאַפְּךָ֥ תוֹכִיחֵ֑נִי וְֽאַל־בַּחֲמָתְךָ֥ תְיַסְּרֵֽנִי׃**

The opening petition establishes a sophisticated theology of divine discipline through carefully chosen terminology. The double negative imperatives—`אַל־בְּאַפְּךָ֥ תוֹכִיחֵ֑נִי וְֽאַל־בַּחֲמָתְךָ֥ תְיַסְּרֵֽנִי`—reveal a suppliant who acknowledges guilt but negotiates the terms of divine response. The lexical precision here is crucial: `תוֹכִיחֵ֑נִי` derives from the root יכח, which carries forensic connotations of legal proof, correction, and argumentative demonstration, while `תְיַסְּרֵֽנִי` from יסר suggests disciplinary instruction with overtones of physical constraint or suffering.

The parallel anger terms create a progression of intensity. `אַף` (nostril anger) represents visible, immediate wrath—the flaring of nostrils as a physical manifestation of displeasure—while `חֵמָה` (burning fury) denotes the deeper, sustained heat of divine indignation. As Malbim astutely observes, "there is a difference between *af* and *chemah*: *af* is revealed anger, and *chemah* is the burning fire of anger in secret with harbored hatred and enmity." This distinction transforms the parallel from mere synonymous repetition into psychological escalation.

The verse's rhetorical strategy accepts divine prerogative to discipline while pleading for moderation. Radak captures this nuance: "If You rebuke me for my iniquity, let it not be in Your anger... gently, so that I may be able to bear it." The psalm thus opens not with denial of wrongdoing but with a plea for measured justice—what Jeremiah calls correction `בְּמִשְׁפָט` (with justice, Jer. 10:24) rather than in fury.

Liturgically, this verse appears in the Sefard tradition during the Priestly Blessing, creating a remarkable counterbalance where the congregation's plea for divine mercy accompanies the priestly invocation of blessing. This placement recognizes that even blessing requires the proper disposition of divine attributes—justice tempered by compassion.

## Verse 3

**חָנֵּ֥נִי יְהוָה֮ כִּ֤י אֻמְלַ֫ל־אָ֥נִי רְפָאֵ֥נִי יְהוָ֑ה כִּ֖י נִבְהֲל֣וּ עֲצָמָֽי׃**

The rare term `אֻמְלַ֫ל` (*um-lal-**'Ā***-niy) appears only here and in a handful of other biblical contexts, creating interpretive challenges that illuminate the psalm's theological sophistication. The BDB lexicon defines it as "be weak, languish," relating it to similar terms describing the withering of fertility (1 Sam. 2:5, Jer. 15:9) and the failure of agricultural abundance (Hos. 4:3, Joel 1:10). Rashi's gloss—"devastated and poor in strength" (*konfondouc* in Old French)—suggests complete physical and emotional collapse rather than acute illness.

The progression from `אֻמְלַל` to the terrified bones (`נִבְהֲל֣וּ עֲצָמָֽי`) creates a cascade of terror that moves from general debilitation to specific physical manifestation. The verb `נִבְהֲל֣וּ` (from בהל, to be disturbed/terrified) is typically applied to conscious beings experiencing psychological distress, making its application to bones a striking personification. As noted in the micro-analysis, this transforms the skeleton into "a sentient witness to divine displeasure, making physical suffering a form of theological discourse."

The chiastic structure of the verse—plea for mercy/cause/plea for healing/cause—creates symmetrical argumentation: divine grace is needed because of weakness, divine healing because of terror. The repetition of the divine name (`יְהוָה... יְהוָ֑ה`) frames both petitions, emphasizing the covenantal relationship that grounds the appeal.

Ibn Ezra's observation that the bones represent "the foundations of the body" while the soul in verse 4 represents conscious experience suggests a systematic anatomy of suffering that moves from physical infrastructure to psychological awareness. The bones' terror indicates that the distress has penetrated to the very structural level of human existence, requiring not just symptomatic relief but fundamental restoration.

## Verse 4

**וְנַפְשִׁ֥י נִבְהֲלָ֣ה מְאֹ֑ד וְאַתָּ֥ה יְ֝הוָ֗ה עַד־מָתָֽי׃**

The broken syntax of this verse—`וְאַתָּ֥ה יְ֝הוָ֗ה עַד־מָתָֽי` (*wə-'a-**TĀH** yə-hō-**WĀH** ʿadh-mā-**THĀY***)—represents one of the most powerful examples of emotional fragmentation in biblical poetry. The psalmist begins to address God directly with the emphatic pronoun `וְאַתָּ֥ה` (and You) but trails off into the classic lament formula `עַד־מָתָֽי` (how long), unable to complete the accusation. As Rashi supplies: "will You look on and not heal?" But the text's reticence is more eloquent than any completed complaint.

The intensification from verse 3 to 4 follows a precise progression. If the bones experience terror (`נִבְהֲל֣וּ`), the soul experiences terror "greatly" (`נִבְהֲלָ֣ה מְאֹ֑ד`). The choice of `נֶפֶשׁ` rather than `רוּחַ` or `לֵב` is significant—`נֶפֶשׁ` denotes the whole living being, the animated self that can experience existential dread. The escalation from skeletal terror to soul terror suggests that fear has progressed from the body's infrastructure to its animating center.

The incomplete sentence structure mirrors the psychological state it describes. In extremity, coherent protest dissolves into raw plea. The classical lament formula `עַד־מָתָֽי` appears throughout the Psalter (13:1-2, 74:10, 89:46, 94:3) as the desperate cry of those who experience God's absence as unbearable duration. Here, however, the formula emerges from syntactic breakdown rather than structured complaint, suggesting suffering so intense it disrupts normal linguistic function.

Radak's textual note about the variant spelling `וְאַתָּ֥ה` (with or without the final he) reflects ancient uncertainty about this difficult construction. The Masoretic tradition preserves both readings (kethib and qere), perhaps recognizing that emotional fragmentation resists standardization.

## Verse 5

**שׁוּבָ֣ה יְ֭הוָה חַלְּצָ֣ה נַפְשִׁ֑י הוֹשִׁיעֵ֥נִי לְמַ֣עַן חַסְדֶּֽךָ׃**

The triple imperative sequence—`שׁוּבָ֣ה... חַלְּצָ֣ה... הוֹשִׁיעֵ֥נִי` (*shū-**VĀH**... ḥal-**LTSĀH**... hō-shiy-**ʿĒ**-niy*)—creates an escalating urgency through both semantic and phonetic progression. `שׁוּבָ֣ה` (return/turn) implies that God has withdrawn or turned away; `חַלְּצָ֣ה` (deliver/rescue) suggests active extraction from danger; `הוֹשִׁיעֵ֥נִי` (save me) represents the comprehensive deliverance that encompasses both rescue and restoration.

The lexical choice of `חַלְּצָ֣ה` merits special attention. From the root חלץ, this verb can mean both "to draw out" (as in extracting from danger) and "to equip for battle" (as in prepared warriors). The BDB lexicon notes its use for rescue in poetic contexts (Ps. 18:20, 34:8, 116:8) and its technical military meaning elsewhere. Here, the military connotations may be latent—the psalmist needs not just extraction from difficulty but equipping for spiritual warfare against the forces causing the distress.

The motivation clause `לְמַ֣עַן חַסְדֶּֽךָ` (for the sake of your steadfast love) grounds the appeal not in human merit but in divine character. This phrase appears only twice in the Psalter (here and 44:27), both times in contexts of desperate petition. The concordance pattern reveals that appeals to God's `חֶסֶד` typically occur when human righteousness cannot sustain the request—what Radak calls salvation "not for my righteousness, for I know that I am guilty."

The liturgical tradition has recognized the theological sophistication of this verse. In Jewish liturgy, variations of these imperatives appear in multiple contexts, particularly the phrase "deliver my soul" which resonates through prayers for healing and protection. The systematic movement from divine turning to rescue to salvation creates a template for proper petition that acknowledges both divine sovereignty and human need.

## Verse 6

**כִּ֤י אֵ֣ין בַּמָּ֣וֶת זִכְרֶ֑ךָ בִּ֝שְׁא֗וֹל מִ֣י יוֹדֶה־לָּֽךְ׃**

This verse presents the psalm's central theological argument about death and praise, using parallel terms that reveal sophisticated thinking about the relationship between existence and worship. The pairing of `מָּ֣וֶת` (death) with `שְׁא֗וֹל` (Sheol) and `זִכְרֶ֑ךָ` (remembrance of you) with `יוֹדֶה־לָּֽךְ` (acclaim you) creates a four-term theological proposition: death and Sheol represent the realm where both divine memory and divine praise cease.

The term `זִכְרֶ֑ךָ` is particularly significant. Rather than simple "memory," זכר in biblical Hebrew carries covenantal overtones—it's the active remembrance that maintains relationship and generates response. The concordance evidence shows זכר frequently appearing in contexts of liturgical proclamation and covenant renewal. Here, the psalmist argues that death severs the capacity not just to remember God but to participate in the ongoing covenantal relationship that requires active testimony.

The rhetorical question `מִ֣י יוֹדֶה־לָּֽךְ` employs the Hiphil form of ידה, which denotes public acknowledgment and proclamation rather than private gratitude. The argument thus becomes sophisticated: God's own interests require preserving those capable of public witness to divine faithfulness. Similar arguments appear in Hezekiah's prayer (Isa. 38:18) and other psalms (30:10, 88:11-12, 115:17), suggesting this was a recognized theological principle.

Radak's comment reveals the tension this verse created for medieval interpreters: while the body cannot praise after death, "the soul ascends and praises and extols forever without ceasing." His resolution—that the righteous person desires to live to fulfill God's will and increase the soul's reward—preserves both biblical theology and developed eschatology.

The liturgical use of this verse in various penitential contexts suggests Jewish tradition understood it not as bargaining but as articulating the fundamental relationship between life and divine service that grounds all prayer for healing and deliverance.

## Verse 7

**יָגַ֤עְתִּי ׀ בְּֽאַנְחָתִ֗י אַשְׂחֶ֣ה בְכָל־לַ֭יְלָה מִטָּתִ֑י בְּ֝דִמְעָתִ֗י עַרְשִׂ֥י אַמְסֶֽה׃**

The hyperbolic imagery of this verse—tears capable of making beds swim (`אַשְׂחֶ֣ה`) and couches melt (`אַמְסֶֽה`)—creates one of the most physically impossible yet emotionally resonant images in the Psalter. The rare verb `אַשְׂחֶ֣ה` appears only here, with lexical debate between Rashi's interpretation (making filthy, from the root סחה related to "scum and refuse") and Menachem's connection to swimming (`שְׂחוֹת`). The BDB lexicon opts for "make my bed swim," suggesting tears so abundant they create an aquatic environment.

The parallel verb `אַמְסֶֽה` (I cause to dissolve/melt) from the root מסה typically describes the melting of ice or wax under heat (Ps. 147:18). Applied to furniture, it suggests tears functioning like acid or fire, literally dissolving solid matter. The figurative language database reveals similar dissolution imagery elsewhere (Ps. 39:12, where God consumes human treasures "like a moth"), but here the agent of dissolution is human grief rather than divine judgment.

The alliteration and assonance in Hebrew create drowning effects that phonetically reinforce the semantic content. The sibilant sounds in `אַשְׂחֶ֣ה` (*'as-**ḤEH***) and the liquids in `לַ֭יְלָה מִטָּתִ֑י` (*lay-**LĀH** mit-tā-**THIY***) create an acoustic environment of flowing and dissolving that mirrors the verse's impossible liquefaction.

The temporal marker `בְכָל־לַ֭יְלָה` (every night) suggests this is not momentary weeping but sustained, rhythmic grief that recurs with circadian regularity. Night, the time when vulnerability is heightened and social masks drop, becomes the arena for this liquid dissolution of the material world.

The distinction between `מִטָּתִ֑י` and `עַרְשִׂ֥י` (bed and couch) avoids mere repetition through variation, perhaps suggesting different pieces of sleeping furniture or different aspects of the resting place—formal bed versus informal couch—both equally dissolved by grief's impossible chemistry.

## Verse 8

**עָֽשְׁשָׁ֤ה מִכַּ֨עַס ׀ עֵינִ֗י עָֽתְקָה֙ בְּכָל־צֹ֣רְרָֽי׃**

The introduction of enemies (`צֹ֣רְרָֽי`) marks a crucial transition in the psalm's dramatic structure, broadening the crisis from personal suffering to social opposition. The rare verb `עָֽשְׁשָׁ֤ה` (wasted away) typically describes moth damage or decay—the BDB lexicon cites parallel usage in Job 13:28 and Isaiah 50:9, where moths consume garments. Applied to eyes, it suggests gradual, insidious deterioration rather than dramatic blindness, creating an image of sight slowly being eaten away like cloth by insects.

The causation `מִכַּ֨עַס` (from grief/anger) presents interpretive possibilities. The root כעס can denote either grief or anger, and context suggests both: grief over suffering and anger at enemies who exploit vulnerability. Ibn Ezra captures this duality: "because he sees in his illness that his enemies are rejoicing, and this is the meaning of 'from anger.'" The eyes waste away not simply from tears but from the rage of witnessing enemy schadenfreude.

The second verb `עָֽתְקָה֙` creates textual challenges. Rashi interprets it as aging/becoming old, while others (following the root עתק meaning "to move") suggest displacement from normal position. The rare verb appears elsewhere mainly in Job, typically describing geological movement (Job 14:18, mountains moving from their place). Applied to eyes, it might suggest they have shifted, aged, or been displaced by the force of grief and anger.

The phrase `בְּכָל־צֹ֣רְרָֽי` (because of all my foes) introduces the social dimension that will dominate the psalm's conclusion. The preposition ב can indicate causation—the eye deterioration is caused by enemy action. The plural `צֹרְרָֽי` (my adversaries) suggests not a single opponent but multiple sources of opposition, creating a siege mentality where the sufferer is surrounded by malevolent forces.

This verse demonstrates how physical illness becomes socially complicated: vulnerability invites exploitation, and the psalmist's distress is compounded by those who rejoice in his suffering, creating the emotional complexity that necessitates the dramatic reversal to follow.

## Verse 9

**ס֣וּרוּ מִ֭מֶּנִּי כָּל־פֹּ֣עֲלֵי אָ֑וֶן כִּֽי־שָׁמַ֥ع יְ֝הוָ֗ה ק֣וֹל בִּכְיִֽי׃**

The commanding imperative `ס֣וּרוּ מִ֭מֶּנִּי` (***SŪ**-rū mim-men-**NIY***) represents one of the most dramatic tonal reversals in the Psalter, transforming the suppliant into an authority figure capable of dismissing enemies. The technical phrase `פֹּ֣עֲלֵי אָ֑וֶן` (workers of iniquity) appears sixteen times in the Psalter, typically denoting those whose actions systematically oppose divine order. The term `אָוֶן` encompasses trouble, wickedness, and the destructive consequences of moral corruption—not merely bad behavior but active opposition to cosmic justice.

The theological innovation lies in the remarkable transformation of weeping into "voice": `ק֣וֹל בִּכְיִֽי` (voice of my weeping). The poet elevates weeping from mere emotional expression to `קוֹל`—a medium of communication that God not only hears but receives (יִקָּח, verse 10). This suggests that intense suffering, when directed toward God, becomes a form of prayer more effective than formal petition. The figurative language database shows `קוֹל` frequently appearing in contexts of divine communication and response, but the phrase "voice of weeping" is unique to this psalm.

The perfect tense verb `שָׁמַ֥ע` (has heard) declares divine response as accomplished fact rather than wishful thinking. This is not prospective hope but confident assertion based on the theological principle established in verse 6: God must preserve those capable of divine witness. The psalmist's authority to dismiss enemies stems not from personal power but from assurance of divine hearing.

The liturgical tradition recognizes this verse's power of reversal. In Jewish liturgy, this verse appears in protective contexts, particularly in Rosh Hashanah home rituals where it functions as a protective formula for the new year. The liturgical usage preserves the verse's function as a declaration that divine attention transforms the power dynamics between the faithful and their adversaries.

The verse thus presents a sophisticated theology of prayer: authentic lament becomes divine communication, divine hearing creates human authority, and spiritual confidence enables social transformation.

## Verse 10

**שָׁמַ֣ע יְ֭הוָה תְּחִנָּתִ֑י יְ֝הוָ֗ה תְּֽפִלָּתִ֥י יִקָּֽח׃**

The perfect and imperfect tense sequence—`שָׁמַ֣ע` (has heard) and `יִקָּֽח` (receives/will receive)—creates temporal sophistication that declares divine response both accomplished and ongoing. The verb `יִקָּֽח` (from לקח, to take/receive) is particularly significant; while it can mean simple receiving, in cultic contexts it often denotes acceptance of offerings or prayers with favor. The BDB lexicon notes its use for God accepting sacrifices (Hos. 14:3) and prayers (Ps. 6:10), suggesting not merely auditory reception but active, favorable response.

The parallel terms `תְּחִנָּתִ֑י` (my supplication) and `תְּֽפִלָּתִ֥י` (my prayer) represent different modes of petition. `תְּחִנָּה` derives from the root חנן (to be gracious) and typically denotes plea for mercy or favor, while `תְּפִלָּה` from פלל suggests intercession or mediation. The pairing suggests comprehensive divine receptivity to both urgent plea and structured petition.

The repetition of the divine name (`יְ֭הוָה... יְ֝הוָ֗ה`) frames the verse with covenantal emphasis, reinforcing that this is not generic divine response but specific covenant faithfulness. The phonetic stress pattern—`shā-**MAʿ** yə-hō-**WĀH** tə-ḥin-nā-**THIY** yə-hō-**WĀH** **TƏ**-fil-lā-thiy yiq-**QĀḤ**`—creates rhythmic balance that mirrors the theological balance between divine action (hearing/receiving) and human petition (supplication/prayer).

The verse's liturgical preservation in multiple contexts (Selichot, festival prayers) reflects Jewish recognition of its paradigmatic character. The progression from verse 9's dismissal of enemies to verse 10's declaration of divine acceptance creates a template for understanding how authentic lament transforms power relationships: when God truly hears, human authority follows naturally.

Ibn Ezra's observation that the psalmist "acknowledges that God healed him from his illness, not the physicians, because he pleaded to Him" captures the verse's theological claim that divine hearing creates not just comfort but actual transformation of circumstances.

## Verse 11

**יֵבֹ֤שׁוּ ׀ וְיִבָּהֲל֣וּ מְאֹ֣ד כָּל־אֹיְבָ֑י יָשֻׁ֥בוּ יֵ֝בֹ֗שׁוּ רָֽגַע׃**

The perfect chiastic reversal in this concluding verse completes the psalm's dramatic arc through sophisticated wordplay and temporal compression. The verb `יִבָּהֲל֣וּ` (will be terrified) employs the same root (בהל) used to describe the psalmist's terror in verses 3-4 (`נִבְהֲל֣וּ עֲצָמָֽי... וְנַפְשִׁ֥י נִבְהֲלָ֣ה מְאֹ֑ד`), creating precise lexical symmetry that transfers the experience of terror from victim to oppressor. This is not mere poetic justice but theological necessity—the divine response must restore proper order by redistributing the emotional and spiritual consequences of evil.

The temporal marker `רָֽגַע` (in an instant/moment) emphasizes the speed of this reversal, contrasting sharply with the prolonged suffering described earlier (`בְכָל־לַ֭יְלָה מִטָּתִ֑י`). The BDB lexicon shows `רֶגַע` typically used for momentary duration, often in contexts of divine intervention that rapidly transforms circumstances (Isa. 47:9, 54:7-8, Jer. 4:20). The phonetic stress—`**RĀ**-ghaʿ`—receives emphasis that underscores the instantaneous nature of divine justice.

The double occurrence of `יֵבֹ֤שׁוּ` (they will be ashamed) frames the verse with repetition that creates closure through emphasis. Shame in biblical psychology represents not merely embarrassment but the public recognition of having been fundamentally wrong about reality—what the enemies expected (the psalmist's defeat) proves false, revealing their misjudgment of both human worth and divine character.

The verb `יָשֻׁ֥בוּ` (they will return/turn back) can be interpreted multiple ways. Traditional commentators like Radak suggest the enemies "return to me to be at peace," implying reconciliation. But the context may support a simpler reading: they retreat or withdraw, having discovered their adversary enjoys divine protection they had not anticipated.

Rashi's elaborate midrashic interpretation of the double shame—involving future judgment, divine record-keeping, and repeated condemnation—reflects rabbinic recognition that this verse establishes a pattern for ultimate justice that extends beyond immediate historical vindication to eschatological resolution.

The liturgical preservation of this verse in protective prayers demonstrates Jewish tradition's understanding that authentic relationship with God ultimately transforms all hostile relationships, either through reconciliation or through the removal of those who persist in opposition to divine order.
