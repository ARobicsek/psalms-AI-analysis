# Commentary on Psalm 6
---
## Introduction
Psalm 6 begins in the minor key and ends with a shout. It is the choreography of despair into confidence: bones shaking, a soul “terrified exceedingly,” tears soaking the bed, a night that seems to have no end—and then, without narrative explanation, the psalmist orders his enemies out of the room. The tradition put Psalm 6 at the head of the Seven Penitential Psalms, but its focus is not confession; it is the plea of a sick, exhausted human being asking God to heal, to return, to rescue, and—crucially—to hear.
The superscription places the poem in a professionalized temple world: לַמְנַצֵּחַ בִּנְגִינוֹת עַל־הַשְּׁמִינִית, “For the choirmaster; with stringed instruments; on the sheminith.” The enigmatic הַשְּׁמִינִית (hashminit) likely marks an eight-stringed instrument or an “eighth” mode; the only other psalm with this tag is Psalm 12, and 1 Chronicles 15:21 mentions Levitical musicians “with lyres on the sheminith” (בְּכִנּוֹרוֹת עַל־הַשְּׁמִינִית). However we parse the term, this was music with strings—crafted sound carrying crafted lament.
From the first petition, the tone is calibrated: “YHWH, do not reprove me in your anger; do not discipline me in your fury” (ה׳ אַל־בְּאַפְּךָ תוֹכִיחֵנִי; וְאַל־בַּחֲמָתְךָ תְיַסְּרֵנִי). The double verb—תוכיח (yekhiakh, “reprove/correct”) and תיסר (yassar, “discipline/chastise”)—is pedagogical as much as judicial: God is not asked to stop correcting; He is asked to correct without rage. Jeremiah makes the same distinction explicit: “Discipline me, O YHWH, but in justice; not in your anger” (יִסְּרֵנִי ה׳ אַךְ בְּמִשְׁפָּט, Jer 10:24). This is not a plea of innocence; it is a plea that mercy temper the lesson.
What follows is medical and visceral. “Be gracious to me… heal me… for I am אֻמְלַל—languishing” (v. 3). The rare adjective evokes withering and collapse. The poet’s bones (עֲצָמַי) are “terrified” (נִבְהֲלוּ), and then the inner life itself: “וְנַפְשִׁי נִבְהֲלָה מְאֹד,” “my soul is greatly terrified” (v. 4). The root בהל (bhl) recurs in the arc of the poem: it marks the psalmist’s physical core (bones), then the whole person (soul), and at the end it rebounds on the enemies (v. 11). This is what literary critics call a “chiasm,” a mirror structure in which earlier elements return in reversed form; here the initial terror is transferred to those who had exploited the speaker’s weakness. The forms are not identical—v. 3 has a Niphal perfect plural (נִבְהֲלוּ), v. 4 a Niphal perfect feminine (נִבְהֲלָה), and v. 11 a Niphal imperfect plural (יִבָּהֲלוּ)—but the echo is deliberate and audible.
The line that follows is a cry broken off mid-sentence: “וְאַתָּה ה׳—עַד־מָתָי” (v. 4). Literally: “And You, YHWH—how long?” The expected verb is missing. The grammar mimics the ache. Elsewhere the psalmist spells out the question—“How long, YHWH, will You forget me forever?” (עַד־אָנָה ה׳ תִשְׁכָּחֵנִי נֶצַח, Ps 13:2)—but here the poet runs out of breath. The ketiv-qere variation (ואת/ואתה) is a scribal detail; the rhetoric is the point: prayer pushed to the margin of speech.
Verse 5 pivots from complaint to command. The poet tells God to turn (שׁוּבָה ה׳), to extract (חַלְּצָה נַפְשִׁי), to save (הוֹשִׁיעֵנִי). Telling God to “return” presumes a felt withdrawal; Psalm 90:13 dares the same imperative: “שׁוּבָה ה׳, עַד־מָתַי—Turn, O YHWH! How long?” The ground is not merit but chesed—covenantal loyalty: “לְמַעַן חַסְדֶּךָ,” “for the sake of your steadfast love” (v. 5). The Hebrew חֶסֶד is not vague “kindness.” It is the durable, relational bond that God has promised, and to which the suppliant appeals when other claims fail. The same logic undergirds Psalm 44:27: “וּפְדֵנוּ לְמַעַן חַסְדֶּךָ—Redeem us for the sake of Your steadfast love.”
Then the startling argument: “For in death there is no remembrance of You; in Sheol who will praise You?” (v. 6). This is the psalm’s Sheol theology laid bare. The dead do not sing. Hezekiah says it with pathos: “כִּי לֹא שְׁאוֹל תּוֹדֶךָ; מָוֶת יְהַלְלֶךָ—For Sheol cannot praise You; death cannot celebrate You” (Isa 38:18). Psalm 115:17 is blunter: “לֹא הַמֵּתִים יְהַלְלוּ־יָּהּ—The dead do not praise YH.” And Psalm 30:10 presses God: “מַה־בֶּצַע בְּדָמִי… הֲיוֹדְךָ עָפָר?—What profit is there in my blood… will the dust praise You?” This is not metaphysics. It is the gritty conviction that God’s theater is the land of the living. Save me, the poet says, or lose my song.
The imagery reaches its nadir in verse 7: “I am weary with groaning; every night I drench my bed, I melt my couch in tears.” The verbs are deliberately extravagant. אַשְׂחֶה (from שׂחה) suggests “I make it swim/drench”; אַמְסֶה (from מסה) is “I melt.” The same melting, applied to tears, appears in Psalm 102:10: “וְשִׁקּוּי בִבְכִי מָסָכְתִּי—my drink I have mixed with weeping.” Hebrew lament traffics in this purposeful hyperbole. The night intensifies it: “בְּכָל־לַיְלָה,” “every night,” when pain is worse and people are asleep. The Rabbis even drew an ethical portrait from it: “Even in his illness David upheld the eighteen ordinances, as it is said, יָגַעְתִּי בְּאַנְחָתִי—‘I am weary with my groaning’” (Sanhedrin 107a as cited by Torah Temimah). Whatever the historical referent, Jewish memory heard in David’s tears not only weakness but fidelity.
Verse 8 introduces the social dimension: “My eye is wasted from vexation; it has grown old because of all my foes.” The verb עָשְׁשָׁה (“is moth-eaten/wasted”) is rare; Psalm 31:10 repeats the line almost verbatim, expanding it to “my soul and my belly,” and thus yoking physical, psychological, and social distress: “עָשְׁשָׁה בְכַעַס עֵינִי; נַפְשִׁי וּבִטְנִי.” Illness quickly becomes public shame.
Then the pivot. Verse 9 turns outward: “סֻרוּ מִמֶּנִּי כָּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן—Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.” Why? “כִּי־שָׁמַע ה׳ קוֹל בִּכְיִי—For YHWH has heard the sound of my weeping.” The verb שָׁמַע—“hear”—will be hammered three times (vv. 9–10), moving from “sound of my weeping,” to “my supplication” (תְּחִנָּתִי), to “my prayer” (תְּפִלָּתִי). All forms of vocalized distress are legitimate address: raw sound, an appeal for favor, a formal prayer. The final verb, יִקַּח (“takes/receives”), is cultic: God “receives” the prayer, like an offering accepted. The Septuagint renders, “the Lord will receive (προσδέξεται) my prayer,” making the sacrificial metaphor explicit.
The poem ends with the mirror image of its beginning: “All my enemies shall be ashamed and greatly terrified; they shall turn back; they shall be ashamed in a moment” (v. 11). Shame (בּוֹשׁ) and terror (בהל) regularly travel together in laments (see Ps 31:18: “יֵבֹשׁוּ רְשָׁעִים יִדְּמוּ לִשְׁאוֹל—Let the wicked be ashamed; let them be silent in Sheol”). Here two temporalities are contrasted: the psalmist’s “every night” of weeping, and the enemies’ “רָגַע”—“in a moment”—of reversal. God’s intervention is not explained; it is announced.
Three brief notes of craft. First, the poem is framed by repeated divine names at the head of cola, a kind of liturgical anaphora that keeps the address steady in distress. Second, the small chiastic arc—the same root בהל carried from speaker to foes—enacts the poem’s theology of reversal without bravado. A “chiasm” is a mirror pattern (A-B-Bʹ-Aʹ) in thought or diction; it often marks turning points. Third, the broken line “וְאַתָּה ה׳—עַד־מָתָי” is as good an instance as any of Hebrew poetry’s terseness: a single colon can carry a scream.
If Psalm 6 is not “penitential,” what is it? A prayer for healing that refuses to spiritualize pain. A theology of hearing that treats tears as speech. A ritual script that moves a sufferer from “how long?” to “the Lord has received my prayer.” And perhaps most of all, a corrective to the fantasy that faith means unbroken composure. The psalmist’s composure is broken, and that is why the poem works.
—Definitions: “Colon” names a single line of poetry within a parallel pair. “Chiasm” is an inverted A–B–Bʹ–Aʹ pattern. “Niphal” is a Hebrew verbal stem that often expresses a passive or middle voice (“be terrified” rather than “terrify”).
## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use
#### Full psalm
In the weekday service, Psalm 6 is the core of Tachanun (Supplication), recited during Nefilat Apayim (“falling on the face”) after the Amidah. It is framed by David’s choice to fall into God’s hand rather than man’s: “וַיֹּאמֶר דָּוִד אֶל־גָּד: צַר־לִי מְאֹד; נִפְּלָה־נָּא בְיַד־ה׳, כִּי רַבִּים רַחֲמָיו; וּבְיַד־אָדָם אַל־אֶפֹּלָה” (2 Sam 24:14). English: “David said to Gad: ‘I am in great distress; let us fall into the hand of YHWH, for His mercies are many; but let me not fall into the hand of man.’” The full psalm is omitted on joyous days, signaling that it is a weekday discipline of contrition.
#### Key verses
Verse 2. “ה׳ אַל־בְּאַפְּךָ תוֹכִיחֵנִי; וְאַל־בַּחֲמָתְךָ תְיַסְּרֵנִי—O YHWH, do not reprove me in Your anger; do not discipline me in Your fury.” In the Sefardic rite this line appears among the congregational responses surrounding Birkat Kohanim (Priestly Blessing), bracketed by the Thirteen Attributes: “ה׳ ה׳, קֵל רַחוּם וְחַנּוּן… ה׳ אַל בְּאַפְּּךָ תוֹכִיחֵנִי; וְאַל בַּחֲמָתְךָ תְיַסְּרֵנִי.” English: “YHWH, YHWH, God merciful and gracious… O YHWH, do not reprove me in Your anger; do not discipline me in Your fury.” The placement frames blessing with a plea for tempered judgment.
Verse 5. “שׁוּבָה ה׳; חַלְּצָה נַפְשִׁי—Return, O YHWH; rescue my soul.” In the Edot HaMizrach Yom Kippur Mussaf (Seder HaAvodah), the line is woven into the acrostic piyyut: “דְּרַשְׁתִּיךָ בְּשִׁמְשִׁי… שׁוּבָה ה׳ חַלְּצָה נַפְשִׁי,” “I sought You… Return, O YHWH, rescue my soul,” aligning the day’s atonement drama with the psalm’s rescue plea.
Verse 10. “שָׁמַע ה׳ תְּחִנָּתִי; ה׳ תְּפִלָּתִי יִקָּח—YHWH has heard my supplication; YHWH will receive my prayer.” In Edot HaMizrach Selichot (Yom Kippur eve), this stands among stacked “hear” verses: “שְׁמַע־ה׳ וְחׇנֵּנִי… שָׁמַע ה׳ תְּחִנָּתִי; ה׳ תְּפִלָּתִי יִקָּח,” underscoring the theme of accepted prayer.
#### Phrases
“סֻרוּ מִמֶּנִּי כָּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן—Depart from me, all workers of iniquity” (v. 9). In some Mizrahi households this appears in the Rosh Hashanah Seder Simanim: “שֶׁיִּסְתַּלְּקוּ אוֹיְבֶיךָ וְשֹׂנְאֶיךָ… סֻרוּ מִמֶּנִּי כָּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן,” “May Your enemies and those who hate you depart… Depart from me, all workers of iniquity,” domesticating the psalm’s dismissal of foes into a New Year’s hope.
“יָגַעְתִּי בְּאַנְחָתִי; אַשְׂחֶה בְכָל־לַיְלָה מִטָּתִי” (v. 7). This verse appears in Motzaʾei Shabbat zemirot: “חָלְפָה עוֹנַת מִנְחָתִי… יָגַעְתִּי בְּאַנְחָתִי; אַשְׂחֶה בְכָל־לַיְלָה,” “My time of rest has passed… I am weary with sighing; all night I drench,” reinterpreting the psalmist’s tears as grief over the Sabbath’s departure.
“וְנַפְשִׁי נִבְהֲלָה מְאֹד” (v. 4) is woven into the Sefardic kerovah for Shabbat Zachor: “וְנַפְשִׁי נִבְהֲלָה מְאֹד וּמִשְׁתּוֹמֵם,” placing the psalm’s personal terror within the communal memory of Amalek.
These uses do not force the text; they extend it. Where the psalm speaks of hearing, the liturgy answers: “He has heard.”

## Verse-by-Verse Commentary
**Verse 1**
לַמְנַצֵּחַ בִּנְגִינוֹת עַל־הַשְּׁמִינִית; מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד׃
The superscription opens a window into temple practice. לַמְנַצֵּחַ (lamnatseach) signals the poem is entrusted to a professional director; בִּנְגִינוֹת locates it in the repertoire “with stringed instruments.” The rare tag עַל־הַשְּׁמִינִית (“on the sheminith,” “the eighth”) appears here and at Psalm 12:1, and 1 Chronicles 15:21 describes Levites playing “בְּכִנּוֹרוֹת עַל־הַשְּׁמִינִית,” “with lyres on the sheminith.” Interpretations range from an eight-stringed instrument to an octave or mode. The Septuagint’s ὑπὲρ τὸν ὄγδοον (“for the eighth”) preserves the enigma without solving it. Either way, the heading signals that the poem is not private diary but public prayer—crafted for performance.
This matters because Psalm 6 narrates a deeply personal crisis in a liturgical key. The cries and sobbing are not purely spontaneous; they have been set to strings. The tears are not diminished by form; they are amplified by it. That paradox—raw distress carried by skill—pervades the poem.
A second note: the density of divine names in the body of the psalm (ה׳ appears nine times in vv. 2–10) functions as an anaphora, a repeated name at the head of lines that keeps the address steady. The superscription cues us to listen for that rhythm; the performance creates faith’s cadence: petition, pause, petition again.
Finally, “מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד” (“a psalm of David”) is not a historical footnote. In Jewish memory, the Davidic tag gave the psalm an authorial persona through which generations spoke—most vividly in Tachanun, where David’s choice to “fall into God’s hand” (2 Sam 24:14) frames the entire recitation. This frame reorients the reading: the “I” is not only David’s. It becomes any sufferer’s.
**Verse 2**
ה׳ אַל־בְּאַפְּךָ תוֹכִיחֵנִי; וְאַל־בַּחֲמָתְךָ תְיַסְּרֵנִי׃
The twin petitions are carefully paired. אַף (“anger,” literally “nose”) and חֵמָה (“fury/heat”) belong to the vocabulary of wrath; the second intensifies the first. Likewise the verbs: יכח (“reprove/correct”) and יסר (“discipline/chastise”). The effect is not redundancy but calibration: the psalmist acknowledges the legitimacy of divine correction and asks that the temperature be lowered. Jeremiah puts the logic into prose: “יִסְּרֵנִי ה׳ אַךְ בְּמִשְׁפָּט; אַל־בְּאַפְּךָ—Discipline me, O YHWH, but with justice; not in Your anger” (Jer 10:24).
The line’s force is ethical and theological. Ethically, it avoids a shallow denial (“I’ve done nothing wrong”) and a shallow self-accusation (“I’m worthless”). Theologically, it affirms God’s pedagogy—discipline that aims to form, not to destroy. For this reason Psalm 6, though beloved as “penitential,” is better read as a healing psalm that knows God may teach through illness but rejects the caricature of a God who delights in pain.
Psalm 38:2 repeats our verse with “wrath” (קֶצֶף) in place of “anger.” Hebrew poets often build a lexicon of near-synonyms to vary the music while sustaining the thought. The LXX of Psalm 6 underscores the point by doubling the second-person pronoun—“O Lord, do not in your anger reprove me, nor in your wrath chastise me”—keeping the focus where the psalmist keeps it: on how God wields power.
Liturgically, this verse has been woven into the responses around Birkat Kohanim in the Sefardic rite, immediately after the recitation of “YHWH, YHWH, a God merciful and gracious…” Placed there, it functions as a hedge against presumption: even as blessing is pronounced, the community asks that necessary correction be gentle.
**Verse 3**
חָנֵּנִי ה׳ כִּי אֻמְלַל־אָנִי; רְפָאֵנִי ה׳ כִּי נִבְהֲלוּ עֲצָמָי׃
Two imperatives frame two “because” clauses: “Be gracious… because I am languishing; heal… because my bones are terrified.” The rare adjective אֻמְלַל evokes withering (cf. Joel 1:10), a life dried out. The second clause presses inward: it is not only pain; the skeletal core shakes. The Niphal of בהל (“to be dismayed/terrified”) appears elsewhere for nations shocked at God’s acts: “אָז נִבְהֲלוּ אַלּוּפֵי אֱדוֹם—Then were the chiefs of Edom dismayed” (Exod 15:15). Here the shock is somatic: “עֲצָמָי,” “my bones,” stand in for the whole person. Hebrew often uses body parts metonymically—heart, hand, bones—to give physical texture to inner experience.
Notice the repetition of the divine name: חָנֵּנִי ה׳… רְפָאֵנִי ה׳. Address is its own structure. The lines build a rhetorical ladder: ask for grace (חנן), ask for healing (רפא), name the collapse (אֻמְלַל), name the terror (נִבְהֲלוּ עֲצָמָי).
The verse helps explain why Jewish tradition associated Psalm 6 with Tachanun. The prayer posture of Nefilat Apayim—head bowed to the forearm—enacts the sense of being “unmade.” Yet the verbs here are not passive. The psalmist asks for re-making (“heal me”) and insists on being heard, the theme that will dominate the closing movement.
**Verse 4**
וְנַפְשִׁי נִבְהֲלָה מְאֹד; וְאַתָּה ה׳—עַד־מָתָי׃
The terror (בהל) escalates: from bones to נֶפֶשׁ (“soul/life”), and with it the intensity (מְאֹד). Then the line breaks. “וְאַתָּה ה׳—עַד־מָתָי,” “And You, O YHWH—how long?” The missing verb is the meaning: “How long [will You be silent? be distant? delay?]” The formula “How long?” is the signature question of lament: “עַד־אָנָה ה׳ תִּשְׁכָּחֵנִי נֶצַח—How long, O YHWH, will You forget me forever?” (Ps 13:2). Here the poet compresses it to a cry that cannot quite form a sentence.
The ketiv-qere detail (ואת/ואתה) is negligible to sense. The rhetorical effect is everything. Biblical Hebrew poetry is famously terse; here the ellipsis becomes embodiment. The poet teaches the reader how to read by making the reader supply the missing verb, and with it, the inner complaint.
The first half-colon is a fine example of how Hebrew diction can name whole-person experience without abstraction: “וְנַפְשִׁי נִבְהֲלָה מְאֹד.” It is not only the bones that tremble. The “I”—as living, desiring, fearing being—is thrown into panic. That is the clause God “hears” later, when “weeping” is given a voice.
**Verse 5**
שׁוּבָה ה׳; חַלְּצָה נַפְשִׁי; הוֹשִׁיעֵנִי לְמַעַן חַסְדֶּךָ׃
Three imperatives: “Return,” “rescue,” “save.” The first is bold. To tell God “שׁוּבָה”—“turn back”—presumes that anger has acted like a withdrawal and that God’s “return” will be salvation. Psalm 90:13 uses the same imperative next to “how long?”: “שׁוּבָה ה׳; עַד־מָתַי,” yoking divine turning to the end of delay.
חַלֵּץ (piel) originally means “draw off” (e.g., a sandal), and by extension “draw out from danger” (BDB). Here, “חַלְּצָה נַפְשִׁי,” “rescue my life,” imagines extraction—out of a pit, out of an illness. The third verb, הוֹשִׁיעֵנִי (“save me”), is the root of יְשׁוּעָה (“deliverance”), the word that will later name the psalmist’s confidence.
The ground clause is the theological heart: “לְמַעַן חַסְדֶּךָ,” “for the sake of Your steadfast love.” This is the move from quid pro quo to covenant. The psalmist does not bargain on righteousness; he leans into God’s declared character. Psalm 44:27 articulates the same logic in national terms: “קוּמָה עֶזְרָתָה לָנוּ; וּפְדֵנוּ לְמַעַן חַסְדֶּךָ—Arise, be our help; redeem us for the sake of Your steadfast love.” The appeal to חֶסֶד is startlingly frank: “You owe me nothing; You have bound Yourself to Your people. Act in accordance with that binding.”
**Verse 6**
כִּי אֵין בַּמָּוֶת זִכְרֶךָ; בִּשְׁאוֹל מִי יוֹדֶה־לָּךְ׃
This is the Bible’s early Sheol theology in a couplet. The underworld is silence. Praise belongs to life. Hezekiah’s psalm says it plainly: “כִּי לֹא שְׁאוֹל תּוֹדֶךָ; מָוֶת יְהַלְלֶךָ; לֹא־יְשַׂבְּרוּ יוֹרְדֵי בוֹר אֶל־אֲמִתֶּךָ—For Sheol cannot praise You; death cannot celebrate You; those who go down to the Pit do not hope for Your truth” (Isa 38:18). Psalm 115:17 adds: “לֹא הַמֵּתִים יְהַלְלוּ־יָּהּ—The dead do not praise YH.” And Psalm 30:10 makes the rhetorical flourish: “מַה־בֶּצַע בְּדָמִי… הֲיוֹדְךָ עָפָר?—What profit in my blood… will the dust praise You?”
The idiom “זִכְרֶךָ” (“Your remembrance”) is more than memory; it is active, cultic remembrance that includes praise. “יוֹדֶה” (Hiphil of ידה, “give thanks”) is the verb of liturgical thanksgiving. The point is pragmatic, almost impertinent: God values praise; the dead do not praise. Save me for the sake of Your honor. This is not an afterlife doctrine; it is a theology of liturgy.
The contrast with Egypt’s exuberant afterlife pieties (rituals for the dead) is not incidental. Israel’s prayer is conspicuously this-worldly: “God lives in life,” as Rabbi Sacks glossed the biblical chorus. Psalm 6 leverages that truth into an argument.
**Verse 7**
יָגַעְתִּי בְּאַנְחָתִי; אַשְׂחֶה בְכָל־לַיְלָה מִטָּתִי; בְּדִמְעָתִי עַרְשִׂי אַמְסֶה׃
This is the poem’s nadir and one of its most crafted lines. The verbs are chosen for their physicality and their sound. אַשְׂחֶה (from שׂחה, “to swim/drench”) and אַמְסֶה (from מסה, “to melt/dissolve”) hyperbolize the volume of tears. It is absurd to “melt” a bed. That is the point. Hebrew lament favors such hyperbole to voice extremity. Psalm 102:10 runs the same metaphor in prose: “כִּי־אֵפֶר כַלֶּחֶם אָכָלְתִּי; וְשִׁקּוּי בִבְכִי מָסָכְתִּי—For I have eaten ashes like bread; and mixed my drink with weeping.”
Read aloud, the line evokes the hush and hiss of water, especially in the first colon: אַשְׂחֶה בְכָל־לַיְלָה מִטָּתִי (`'as-**ḤEH** və-khol-lay-**LĀH** mit-tā-**THIY``). The sibilants and liquids mimic the leak and flow of tears. The temporal phrase “בְּכָל־לַיְלָה,” “every night,” adds the cruelty of insomnia: pain is worse then, and one can howl without an audience.
The Talmud heard something else here as well: fidelity. “אפילו בשעת חליו של דוד קיים שמנה עשרה עונות—Even in his illness David upheld the eighteen ordinances,” the prooftext being “יָגַעְתִּי בְּאַנְחָתִי” (Sanhedrin 107a). The rabbinic appropriation is interpretive rather than contextual, but it is part of the psalm’s reception history: Psalm 6 was read as a script for piety in affliction.
The second colon’s “בְּדִמְעָתִי,” “with my tears,” personifies weeping as an instrument. That will matter in verse 9, where “the voice of my weeping” (קוֹל בִּכְיִי) becomes the thing God “hears.”
**Verse 8**
עָשְׁשָׁה מִכַּעַס עֵינִי; עָתְקָה בְּכָל־צוֹרְרָי׃
The poem pivots to the social dimension of suffering. “עָשְׁשָׁה,” from a root meaning “to be moth-eaten, waste,” describes the eye as corroded. Psalm 31:10 mirrors the line and expands it: “חָנֵּנִי ה׳ כִּי צַר־לִי; עָשְׁשָׁה בְּכַעַס עֵינִי; נַפְשִׁי וּבִטְנִי—Be gracious to me, O YHWH, for I am in distress; my eye is wasted with grief; my soul and my belly [too].” The parallel suggests a conventional image: prolonged grief sickens seeing and being.
“מִכַּעַס” is ambiguous—“from vexation/grief” (inner emotion) or “from provocation” (enemies’ taunts). The second half-colon clarifies: “עָתְקָה בְּכָל־צוֹרְרָי,” “it has grown old [or: been displaced] because of all my foes.” The participial noun “צוֹרֵר” (from צרר, “to oppress, be hostile”) recurs in laments. Physical suffering is rarely private; it is social vulnerability exploited by others. The psalmist’s eye—the organ of seeing and being seen—cannot bear the gaze.
The poem thus has two enemy sets: the illness that undoes the body and the humans who turn that undoing into mockery. Psalm 41:7–10 paints the portrait memorably: “My lovers and friends stand aloof from my plague… they speak falsehood… every evil they devise against me.” Psalm 6 compresses the same experience into two words: עֵינִי… צוֹרְרָי.
**Verse 9**
סֻרוּ מִמֶּנִּי כָּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן; כִּי־שָׁמַע ה׳ קוֹל בִּכְיִי׃
Here the tone turns on a dime. “סֻרוּ מִמֶּנִּי,” “Depart from me,” is an imperative to human opponents. “פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן,” “workers of iniquity,” is a stock phrase (cf. Ps 5:6; 92:8, 10), naming those whose mischief is habitual, almost professional. The reason follows: “כִּי־שָׁמַע ה׳ קוֹל בִּכְיִי,” “for YHWH has heard the sound of my weeping.”
Two things are decisive. First, “weeping” is given a “voice” (קוֹל), as in Genesis 45:2 where Joseph “gave forth his voice in weeping” (וַיִּתֵּן אֶת־קֹלוֹ בִּבְכִי). Tears become speech. Second, “hearing” in biblical idiom implies action. The Exodus begins this way: “וַיִּשְׁמַע אֱלֹקִים אֶת־נַאֲקָתָם—God heard their groaning” (Exod 2:24), and the next verse says He remembered His covenant and looked. In laments, the missing “assurance oracle”—a priestly word of acceptance—often lies behind the turn. Psalm 6 does not record such an oracle, but the verb שָׁמַע functions that way: perceived, accepted, responded.
Liturgically, this line anchors the moment when a sufferer in Tachanun lifts head and heart. The Hebrew is simple; the psychology is complex. The psalm does not claim resolution; it claims hearing.
**Verse 10**
שָׁמַע ה׳ תְּחִנָּתִי; ה׳ תְּפִלָּתִי יִקָּח׃
The triple cadence of “hearing” culminates here. The nouns matter. תְּחִנָּה (from חנן, “grace/favor”) is “supplication,” a request that appeals to generosity rather than right. תְּפִלָּה (from פלל, “intercede/judge oneself”) is “prayer,” the more formal, liturgical word. Together with “voice of my weeping” (v. 9), they map a spectrum from raw sound to structured petition. God attends to all three.
The last verb is startling: יִקָּח (“will take/receive”). It is sacrificial language: to “receive” an offering. The Targum and the LXX make it explicit (“will receive”). In a temple culture, prayer is not a poor substitute for sacrifice; it is a form of offering that God can “take.” After 70 CE, Jewish liturgy developed this metaphor into a theology: prayer as “service of the heart” that stands in for sacrifices. Psalm 6 gives the idiom its biblical kernel.
The repetition of the divine name twice in a single verse is both intensifier and bracket. Psalm 6 has made a case, and now the poet allows himself to say, in the perfect, “שָׁמַע”—“He has heard,” while still speaking in hope: “יִקָּח”—“He will receive.”
**Verse 11**
יֵבֹשׁוּ וְיִבָּהֲלוּ מְאֹד כָּל־אֹיְבָי; יָשֻׁבוּ יֵבֹשׁוּ רָגַע׃
The poem’s chiastic arc completes itself. The terror (בהל) that seized the psalmist’s bones and soul now seizes the enemies; shame (בּוֹשׁ) is doubled. The final adverb is crucial: “רָגַע,” “in a moment.” Against “בְּכָל־לַיְלָה” (“every night,” v. 7), the reversal is sudden. God’s action does not need time; the poem needs testimony.
The shame vocabulary belongs to social theater. The enemies had banked on the psalmist’s death; now they “turn back” (יָשֻׁבוּ) and are ashamed of their miscalculation. Psalm 31:18 captures a similar hope: “יֵבֹשׁוּ רְשָׁעִים; יִדְּמוּ לִשְׁאוֹל,” “Let the wicked be ashamed; let them be mute in Sheol.” Psalm 6 is more restrained: it does not narrate their end; it narrates their embarrassment.
The “terror-transfer” is not revenge fantasy but a theological claim: God’s hearing rearranges the social map. The psalmist does not need to explain the mathematics; he needs to aveil himself of the new reality—“Depart from me”—and to say that it came from being heard. That is where the poem ends, and where prayer begins again.
