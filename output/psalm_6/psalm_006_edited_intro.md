Psalm 6 begins in the minor key and ends with a shout. It is the choreography of despair into confidence: bones shaking, a soul “terrified exceedingly,” tears soaking the bed, a night that seems to have no end—and then, without narrative explanation, the psalmist orders his enemies out of the room. The tradition put Psalm 6 at the head of the Seven Penitential Psalms, but its focus is not confession; it is the plea of a sick, exhausted human being asking God to heal, to return, to rescue, and—crucially—to hear.

The superscription places the poem in a professionalized temple world: לַמְנַצֵּחַ בִּנְגִינוֹת עַל־הַשְּׁמִינִית, “For the choirmaster; with stringed instruments; on the sheminith.” The enigmatic הַשְּׁמִינִית (hashminit) likely marks an eight-stringed instrument or an “eighth” mode; the only other psalm with this tag is Psalm 12, and 1 Chronicles 15:21 mentions Levitical musicians “with lyres on the sheminith” (בְּכִנּוֹרוֹת עַל־הַשְּׁמִינִית). However we parse the term, this was music with strings—crafted sound carrying crafted lament.

From the first petition, the tone is calibrated: “YHWH, do not reprove me in your anger; do not discipline me in your fury” (יְהוָה אַל־בְּאַפְּךָ תוֹכִיחֵנִי; וְאַל־בַּחֲמָתְךָ תְיַסְּרֵנִי). The double verb—תוכיח (yekhiakh, “reprove/correct”) and תיסר (yassar, “discipline/chastise”)—is pedagogical as much as judicial: God is not asked to stop correcting; He is asked to correct without rage. Jeremiah makes the same distinction explicit: “Discipline me, O YHWH, but in justice; not in your anger” (יִסְּרֵנִי יְהוָה אַךְ בְּמִשְׁפָּט, Jer 10:24). This is not a plea of innocence; it is a plea that mercy temper the lesson.

What follows is medical and visceral. “Be gracious to me… heal me… for I am אֻמְלַל—languishing” (v. 3). The rare adjective evokes withering and collapse. The poet’s bones (עֲצָמַי) are “terrified” (נִבְהֲלוּ), and then the inner life itself: “וְנַפְשִׁי נִבְהֲלָה מְאֹד,” “my soul is greatly terrified” (v. 4). The root בהל (bhl) recurs in the arc of the poem: it marks the psalmist’s physical core (bones), then the whole person (soul), and at the end it rebounds on the enemies (v. 11). This is what literary critics call a “chiasm,” a mirror structure in which earlier elements return in reversed form; here the initial terror is transferred to those who had exploited the speaker’s weakness. The forms are not identical—v. 3 has a Niphal perfect plural (נִבְהֲלוּ), v. 4 a Niphal perfect feminine (נִבְהֲלָה), and v. 11 a Niphal imperfect plural (יִבָּהֲלוּ)—but the echo is deliberate and audible.

The line that follows is a cry broken off mid-sentence: “וְאַתָּה יְהוָה—עַד־מָתָי” (v. 4). Literally: “And You, YHWH—how long?” The expected verb is missing. The grammar mimics the ache. Elsewhere the psalmist spells out the question—“How long, YHWH, will You forget me forever?” (עַד־אָנָה יְהוָה תִשְׁכָּחֵנִי נֶצַח, Ps 13:2)—but here the poet runs out of breath. The ketiv-qere variation (ואת/ואתה) is a scribal detail; the rhetoric is the point: prayer pushed to the margin of speech.

Verse 5 pivots from complaint to command. The poet tells God to turn (שׁוּבָה יְהוָה), to extract (חַלְּצָה נַפְשִׁי), to save (הוֹשִׁיעֵנִי). Telling God to “return” presumes a felt withdrawal; Psalm 90:13 dares the same imperative: “שׁוּבָה יְהוָה, עַד־מָתַי—Turn, O YHWH! How long?” The ground is not merit but chesed—covenantal loyalty: “לְמַעַן חַסְדֶּךָ,” “for the sake of your steadfast love” (v. 5). The Hebrew חֶסֶד is not vague “kindness.” It is the durable, relational bond that God has promised, and to which the suppliant appeals when other claims fail. The same logic undergirds Psalm 44:27: “וּפְדֵנוּ לְמַעַן חַסְדֶּךָ—Redeem us for the sake of Your steadfast love.”

Then the startling argument: “For in death there is no remembrance of You; in Sheol who will praise You?” (v. 6). This is the psalm’s Sheol theology laid bare. The dead do not sing. Hezekiah says it with pathos: “כִּי לֹא שְׁאוֹל תּוֹדֶךָ; מָוֶת יְהַלְלֶךָ—For Sheol cannot praise You; death cannot celebrate You” (Isa 38:18). Psalm 115:17 is blunter: “לֹא הַמֵּתִים יְהַלְלוּ־יָּהּ—The dead do not praise YH.” And Psalm 30:10 presses God: “מַה־בֶּצַע בְּדָמִי… הֲיוֹדְךָ עָפָר?—What profit is there in my blood… will the dust praise You?” This is not metaphysics. It is the gritty conviction that God’s theater is the land of the living. Save me, the poet says, or lose my song.

The imagery reaches its nadir in verse 7: “I am weary with groaning; every night I drench my bed, I melt my couch in tears.” The verbs are deliberately extravagant. אַשְׂחֶה (from שׂחה) suggests “I make it swim/drench”; אַמְסֶה (from מסה) is “I melt.” The same melting, applied to tears, appears in Psalm 102:10: “וְשִׁקּוּי בִבְכִי מָסָכְתִּי—my drink I have mixed with weeping.” Hebrew lament traffics in this purposeful hyperbole. The night intensifies it: “בְּכָל־לַיְלָה,” “every night,” when pain is worse and people are asleep. The Rabbis even drew an ethical portrait from it: “Even in his illness David upheld the eighteen ordinances, as it is said, יָגַעְתִּי בְּאַנְחָתִי—‘I am weary with my groaning’” (Sanhedrin 107a as cited by Torah Temimah). Whatever the historical referent, Jewish memory heard in David’s tears not only weakness but fidelity.

Verse 8 introduces the social dimension: “My eye is wasted from vexation; it has grown old because of all my foes.” The verb עָשְׁשָׁה (“is moth-eaten/wasted”) is rare; Psalm 31:10 repeats the line almost verbatim, expanding it to “my soul and my belly,” and thus yoking physical, psychological, and social distress: “עָשְׁשָׁה בְכַעַס עֵינִי; נַפְשִׁי וּבִטְנִי.” Illness quickly becomes public shame.

Then the pivot. Verse 9 turns outward: “סֻרוּ מִמֶּנִּי כָּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן—Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.” Why? “כִּי־שָׁמַע יְהוָה קוֹל בִּכְיִי—For YHWH has heard the sound of my weeping.” The verb שָׁמַע—“hear”—will be hammered three times (vv. 9–10), moving from “sound of my weeping,” to “my supplication” (תְּחִנָּתִי), to “my prayer” (תְּפִלָּתִי). All forms of vocalized distress are legitimate address: raw sound, an appeal for favor, a formal prayer. The final verb, יִקַּח (“takes/receives”), is cultic: God “receives” the prayer, like an offering accepted. The Septuagint renders, “the Lord will receive (προσδέξεται) my prayer,” making the sacrificial metaphor explicit.

The poem ends with the mirror image of its beginning: “All my enemies shall be ashamed and greatly terrified; they shall turn back; they shall be ashamed in a moment” (v. 11). Shame (בּוֹשׁ) and terror (בהל) regularly travel together in laments (see Ps 31:18: “יֵבֹשׁוּ רְשָׁעִים יִדְּמוּ לִשְׁאוֹל—Let the wicked be ashamed; let them be silent in Sheol”). Here two temporalities are contrasted: the psalmist’s “every night” of weeping, and the enemies’ “רָגַע”—“in a moment”—of reversal. God’s intervention is not explained; it is announced.

Three brief notes of craft. First, the poem is framed by repeated divine names at the head of cola, a kind of liturgical anaphora that keeps the address steady in distress. Second, the small chiastic arc—the same root בהל carried from speaker to foes—enacts the poem’s theology of reversal without bravado. A “chiasm” is a mirror pattern (A-B-Bʹ-Aʹ) in thought or diction; it often marks turning points. Third, the broken line “וְאַתָּה יְהוָה—עַד־מָתָי” is as good an instance as any of Hebrew poetry’s terseness: a single colon can carry a scream.

If Psalm 6 is not “penitential,” what is it? A prayer for healing that refuses to spiritualize pain. A theology of hearing that treats tears as speech. A ritual script that moves a sufferer from “how long?” to “the Lord has received my prayer.” And perhaps most of all, a corrective to the fantasy that faith means unbroken composure. The psalmist’s composure is broken, and that is why the poem works.

—Definitions: “Colon” names a single line of poetry within a parallel pair. “Chiasm” is an inverted A–B–Bʹ–Aʹ pattern. “Niphal” is a Hebrew verbal stem that often expresses a passive or middle voice (“be terrified” rather than “terrify”).

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

#### Full psalm

In the weekday service, Psalm 6 is the core of Tachanun (Supplication), recited during Nefilat Apayim (“falling on the face”) after the Amidah. It is framed by David’s choice to fall into God’s hand rather than man’s: “וַיֹּאמֶר דָּוִד אֶל־גָּד: צַר־לִי מְאֹד; נִפְּלָה־נָּא בְיַד־יְהוָה, כִּי רַבִּים רַחֲמָיו; וּבְיַד־אָדָם אַל־אֶפֹּלָה” (2 Sam 24:14). English: “David said to Gad: ‘I am in great distress; let us fall into the hand of YHWH, for His mercies are many; but let me not fall into the hand of man.’” The full psalm is omitted on joyous days, signaling that it is a weekday discipline of contrition.

#### Key verses

Verse 2. “יְהוָה אַל־בְּאַפְּךָ תוֹכִיחֵנִי; וְאַל־בַּחֲמָתְךָ תְיַסְּרֵנִי—O YHWH, do not reprove me in Your anger; do not discipline me in Your fury.” In the Sefardic rite this line appears among the congregational responses surrounding Birkat Kohanim (Priestly Blessing), bracketed by the Thirteen Attributes: “יְהוָה יְהוָה, אֵל רַחוּם וְחַנּוּן… יְהוָה אַל בְּאַפְּּךָ תוֹכִיחֵנִי; וְאַל בַּחֲמָתְךָ תְיַסְּרֵנִי.” English: “YHWH, YHWH, God merciful and gracious… O YHWH, do not reprove me in Your anger; do not discipline me in Your fury.” The placement frames blessing with a plea for tempered judgment.

Verse 5. “שׁוּבָה יְהוָה; חַלְּצָה נַפְשִׁי—Return, O YHWH; rescue my soul.” In the Edot HaMizrach Yom Kippur Mussaf (Seder HaAvodah), the line is woven into the acrostic piyyut: “דְּרַשְׁתִּיךָ בְּשִׁמְשִׁי… שׁוּבָה יְהוָה חַלְּצָה נַפְשִׁי,” “I sought You… Return, O YHWH, rescue my soul,” aligning the day’s atonement drama with the psalm’s rescue plea.

Verse 10. “שָׁמַע יְהוָה תְּחִנָּתִי; יְהוָה תְּפִלָּתִי יִקָּח—YHWH has heard my supplication; YHWH will receive my prayer.” In Edot HaMizrach Selichot (Yom Kippur eve), this stands among stacked “hear” verses: “שְׁמַע־יְהוָה וְחׇנֵּנִי… שָׁמַע יְהוָה תְּחִנָּתִי; יְהוָה תְּפִלָּתִי יִקָּח,” underscoring the theme of accepted prayer.

#### Phrases

“סֻרוּ מִמֶּנִּי כָּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן—Depart from me, all workers of iniquity” (v. 9). In some Mizrahi households this appears in the Rosh Hashanah Seder Simanim: “שֶׁיִּסְתַּלְּקוּ אוֹיְבֶיךָ וְשֹׂנְאֶיךָ… סֻרוּ מִמֶּנִּי כָּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן,” “May Your enemies and those who hate you depart… Depart from me, all workers of iniquity,” domesticating the psalm’s dismissal of foes into a New Year’s hope.

“יָגַעְתִּי בְּאַנְחָתִי; אַשְׂחֶה בְכָל־לַיְלָה מִטָּתִי” (v. 7). This verse appears in Motzaʾei Shabbat zemirot: “חָלְפָה עוֹנַת מִנְחָתִי… יָגַעְתִּי בְּאַנְחָתִי; אַשְׂחֶה בְכָל־לַיְלָה,” “My time of rest has passed… I am weary with sighing; all night I drench,” reinterpreting the psalmist’s tears as grief over the Sabbath’s departure.

“וְנַפְשִׁי נִבְהֲלָה מְאֹד” (v. 4) is woven into the Sefardic kerovah for Shabbat Zachor: “וְנַפְשִׁי נִבְהֲלָה מְאֹד וּמִשְׁתּוֹמֵם,” placing the psalm’s personal terror within the communal memory of Amalek.

These uses do not force the text; they extend it. Where the psalm speaks of hearing, the liturgy answers: “He has heard.”
