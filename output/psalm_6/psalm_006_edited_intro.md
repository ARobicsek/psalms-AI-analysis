Psalm 6 is a small, exacting poem that begins with a flinch—“O YHWH, do not rebuke me in your anger” (יְהוָה אַל־בְּאַפְּּךָ תּוֹכִיחֵנִי)—and ends with a shout, “Away from me, all you workers of iniquity” (סוּרוּ מִמֶּנִּי כָּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן). Between those poles, the speaker traverses a terrain where illness feels like judgment, bones know terror, and the night is saline. Psalm 6 is often called a “penitential psalm,” but its penitence is unusually embodied. The poet does not offer abstract contrition; he offers his bones, his bed, his eyes.

The superscription—לַמְנַצֵּחַ בִּנְגִינוֹת עַל־הַשְּׁמִינִית (For the leader; with stringed instruments; on the sheminith)—preserves a mystery. “Sheminith” (הַשְּׁמִינִית) appears only here and in Psalm 12. Most medievals (Rashi, Radak) gloss it as an eight-stringed lyre or an “eighth mode.” The Septuagint renders “ὑπὲρ ὁ ὄγδοος,” “for the eighth,” which could be an octave, a register, or a guild cue. A homiletical tradition (Menachot 43b; echoed by Malbim and Meiri) ties “the eighth” to circumcision on the eighth day—an elegant midrash rather than the plain sense, but one that hears in this psalm a prayer uttered at the threshold of covenantal identity. Either way, the music matters. “With stringed instruments” (בִּנְגִינוֹת) recalls temple craft; in the centuries since, those once-practical notations became part of the poetry, reminders that lament is never only spoken—it is performed.

The opening line calibrates the entire prayer. The poet accepts that God may correct him, but he pleads for the manner of it. Two different words for anger—אַף (visible wrath, literally “nose”) and חֵמָה (smoldering, stored-up fury)—and two different verbs—תּוֹכִיחֵנִי (rebuke/prove) and תְּיַסְּרֵנִי (discipline/chasten)—stage a negotiation between justice and mercy. Jeremiah’s plea “Correct me, YHWH, but with justice; not in your anger” (Jer 10:24) is the same calculus. The psalm thus begins with a theology of proportion.

Verses 3–4 bring the crisis into the body. “Have mercy… for I am אֻמְלַל” (umlal), a word used of fields and vines that “languish” (e.g., Joel 1:10; Hos 4:3). Here the human being is a withered plot. Most striking is the personification: “נִבְהֲלוּ עֲצָמָי” (“my bones are terrified”). In the Psalter, bones are often the deepest register of a person’s condition: “All my bones shall say, ‘YHWH, who is like you?’” (Ps 35:10); “There is no wholeness in my bones because of my sin” (Ps 38:4); “I can count all my bones” (Ps 22:18). In Psalm 6, the fear runs to the frame. The next line intensifies the reach: “And my נֶפֶשׁ is deeply terrified” (וְנַפְשִׁי נִבְהֲלָה מְאֹד). נֶפֶשׁ is not a detachable soul; it is the living self, breath and appetite. Terror has progressed from skeleton to self.

Then the poem breaks: “וְאַתָּה יְהוָה, עַד־מָתָי” (“And You, YHWH—how long?”). The syntax is jagged, as if the speaker loses the strength to complete the sentence. “How long?” (עַד־מָתָי) is a classic lament cry (Ps 13:2–3; 74:10; 89:47; 94:3), but here the cry is preceded by an accusatory “and You,” a finger half-pointed. The Masoretic text notes a Qere/Kethib (read/write) variation on וְאַתָּה; in either case, the line preserves a stammer. Some theology is best done in sentence fragments.

Verse 5 shifts the mode: three imperatives—שׁוּבָה (“turn”), חַלְּצָה (“draw out, deliver”), הוֹשִׁיעֵנִי (“save”)—named in a rising sequence, then grounded by motive: “לְמַעַן חַסְדֶּךָ,” “for the sake of your steadfast love.” That phrase is rare in the Psalms (here and 44:27), and it is precise: the appeal is not to the poet’s merit but to God’s covenantal character. The verb חָלַץ can mean “draw out” (rescue) and, in other contexts, “be equipped for war.” Both resonate: the psalmist needs extraction and re-equipping.

The centerpiece (v. 6) makes a bracing argument: “For in death there is no remembrance of You; in Sheol who will praise You?” In the Bible’s early horizon, Sheol is a shadowland where praise falls silent (Isa 38:18; Ps 30:10; 88:11–12; 115:17). “Remembrance” (זִכְרֶךָ) is covenantal: to remember God is to confess God, especially in public worship. The poet is not bargaining crudely. He is saying: if You wish to be remembered and acclaimed among the living, keep me among the living. Radak, writing in a world that affirms the praise of souls after death, already felt the tension and resolves it by saying the righteous still prefer life to fulfill God’s will. The line remains radical. It grounds the prayer for healing not in self-preservation but in witness.

Verses 7–8 press the grief to hyperbole. “Every night I make my bed swim” (אַשְׂחֶה… מִטָּתִי); “I melt my couch with my tears” (בְּדִמְעָתִי עַרְשִׂי אַמְסֶה). The ancient lexicons already noticed the double sense possibilities: אַשְׂחֶה could be “I make swim” (from שָׂחָה) or “I soil” (Rashi’s link to סְחִי וּמָאוֹס, Lam 3:45). Either way, the image is of liquid overrun. The verse even sounds like water: the sibilants and liquids—אשׂכה… בכל־לילה… בדמעתי… ערשי אמסה—create a hush and hiss that matches the meaning. “Melt” (מָסָה) is a favorite biblical metaphor for dissolution under pressure (Ps 46:7; 58:8–9). Here tears are the solvent. The next line shifts from furniture to vision: “My eye is wasted by vexation” (עָשְׁשָׁה מִכַּעַס עֵינִי), “worn out” like a moth-eaten garment (cf. Job 13:28; Isa 50:9). The eye’s dimming is caused “by all my foes” (בְּכָל־צֹרְרָי). Illness has a social surround; vulnerability invites mockery.

Then, without warning, the psalm turns. “Depart from me, all workers of iniquity, for YHWH has heard the voice of my weeping. YHWH has heard my plea; YHWH will receive my prayer” (vv. 9–10). Two questions always asked here deserve answers. First, what triggers this reversal? In Israel’s laments, the turn often arrives as an “oracle of salvation”—a brief, priestly assurance that the prayer is heard—after which the petitioner speaks in confidence. Whether or not an external oracle is implied, the grammar does the work: perfect verbs (“has heard”) state as accomplished what faith already knows, and the future “will receive” extends that confidence forward. Second, what changed socially? The poet’s authority returns with prayer. “Depart from me” is a dismissal formula. The enemies’ taunt is silenced because “weeping” has become “voice” (קוֹל בִּכְיִי): grief addressed to God becomes speech that God answers. That is the psalm’s most daring insight into prayer.

The final verse completes a structural arc: the terror that gripped bones and soul (“נִבְהֲלוּ,” vv. 3–4) now grips the enemies (יִבָּהֲלוּ, v. 11). “They will turn back” (יָשֻׁבוּ) can mean retreat or repentance; Radak hears a hint of reconciliation. “In a moment” (רָגַע) is one of the Bible’s favorite words for God’s swift reversals (Ps 30:6; Isa 54:7–8; Jer 4:20). The psalm holds together proportionate discipline, embodied suffering, public witness, and social reordering. Its theology is modestly exact: life is where praise belongs, and tears addressed to God become a language God honors.

A few terms for readers:
- Parallelism: the basic poetic technique in Hebrew verse, where a line’s second half “answers” the first (by intensifying, specifying, or contrasting).
- Colon: a single poetic unit, often presented in pairs (the two halves of a verse).
- Chiasm: an inverted structure (A–B–B'–A') that mirrors elements for emphasis.
- LXX: the Septuagint, the ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible.
- Qere/Kethib: Masoretic notations marking what is written in the text (Kethib) and how it is to be read (Qere).

—This is not a grand theory of suffering. It is a compact ritual: plead for proportion, name the body’s terror, argue for life as the arena of praise, let the night be wet, and trust that when grief finds its voice, it will be heard.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

#### Full psalm

In both Ashkenazic and Sefardic rites, Psalm 6 is recited in its entirety during Tachanun (supplicatory prayers) at Shacharit and Mincha on weekdays, within Nefilat Apayim (“falling on one’s face”). The posture—head bowed, often leaning the head on the arm—matches the psalm’s self-humbling tone. Placing Psalm 6 immediately after confession and the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy frames the recitation as a plea that divine justice be tempered by compassion.

#### Key verses

Verse 2: יְהוָה אַל־בְּאַפְּךָ תּוֹכִיחֵנִי וְאַל־בַּחֲמָתְךָ תְיַסְּרֵנִי (“O YHWH, do not rebuke me in Your anger, nor chasten me in Your wrath”). In the Sefard tradition, this line accompanies Birkat Kohanim. The congregation responds: “יְהוָה יְהוָה, אֵל רַחוּם וְחַנּוּן… יְהוָה אַל בְּאַפְּךָ תּוֹכִיחֵנוּ, וְאַל בַּחֲמָתְךָ תְיַסְּרֵנוּ” (“YHWH, YHWH, God compassionate and gracious… O YHWH, do not rebuke us in Your anger, nor chasten us in Your wrath”). The placement is deliberate: the priestly blessing of peace is flanked by a communal plea for moderated judgment.

Verse 10: שָׁמַע יְהוָה תְּחִנָּתִי; יְהוָה תְּפִלָּתִי יִקָּח (“YHWH has heard my supplication; YHWH will receive my prayer”). In Mizrahi Selichot for the eve of Yom Kippur, this verse appears among the biblical invocations that open the service: “שְׁמַע־יְהוָה וְחָנֵּנִי… שָׁמַע יְהוָה תְּחִנָּתִי; יְהוָה תְּפִלָּתִי יִקָּח” (“Hear, O YHWH, and be gracious to me… YHWH has heard my supplication; YHWH will receive my prayer”), establishing the service’s note of confident appeal.

#### Phrases

Psalm 6:9: סוּרוּ מִמֶּנִּי כָּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן (“Depart from me, all workers of iniquity”). In the Rosh Hashanah simanim (home ritual of symbolic foods) in Mizrahi communities, a Yehi Ratzon prayer includes: “שֶׁיִּסְתַּלְּקוּ אוֹיְבֶיךָ וְשֹׂנְאֶיךָ… סוּרוּ מִמֶּנִּי כָּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן, כִּי־שָׁמַע יְהוָה קוֹל בִּכְיִי” (“May Your enemies and haters depart… Depart from me, all workers of iniquity, for YHWH has heard the voice of my weeping”). Here the psalm’s courtroom dismissal becomes a New Year’s protective formula.

Psalm 6:7: יָגַעְתִּי בְּאַנְחָתִי; אַשְׂחֶה בְכָל־לַיְלָה מִטָּתִי (“I am weary with my groaning; each night I drench my bed”). In some Mizrahi motifs for Motzaei Shabbat zemirot (Saturday night songs), the line is woven into a reflective stanza on the transition from holy time: “יָגַעְתִּי בְּאַנְחָתִי אַשְׂחֶה בְכָל־לַיְלָה… פְּתַח לִי שַׁעַר” (“I am weary with my groaning; I drench my bed all night… open for me the gate”), transposing David’s lament into the ache of departure from Shabbat.

Psalm 6:5: שׁוּבָה יְהוָה חַלְּצָה נַפְשִׁי (“Turn, O YHWH; deliver my life”). In the Yom Kippur Mussaf’s Seder Ha-Avodah (Mizrahi rite), a piyyut pleads: “דְּרַשְׁתִּיךָ… שׁוּבָה יְהוָה חַלְּצָה נַפְשִׁי” (“I have sought You… Turn, O YHWH; deliver my life”). The penitential idiom of Psalm 6 becomes the congregation’s corporate voice.

These reuses “read” the psalm faithfully: they foreground moderated justice (v. 2), confident hearing (vv. 9–10), and the social reordering that follows prayer (v. 9). Liturgy thus confirms the psalm’s claim: when weeping becomes voice, authority returns.
