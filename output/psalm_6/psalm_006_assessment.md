# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 6

What works: The draft rightly locates Psalm 6 at the intersection of illness, sin, and social hostility, and it hears the psalm’s audacious claim that “weeping” has a “voice.” It tracks the pivot from lament to confidence, notes the personified “bones,” and attends to lexical nuances (e.g., af vs. chemah; tokhiach vs. yasser). Several traditional commentators are woven in with sensitivity.

Main weaknesses: The essay too often asserts rather than demonstrates. Some claims drift toward the abstract (“sophisticated theology”) without enough anchoring in the Hebrew line or the poem’s sound. The verse-by-verse notes omit a few easy wins: the concordance pattern of למען חסדך (only Ps 6:6; 44:27), the tight network of “bones” imagery across the Psalter (Ps 22:18; 35:10; 38:4), and the usage of רֶגַע (“in a moment”) elsewhere (Ps 30:6; Isa 54:7–8). The dramatic reversal (vv. 9–10) is described but not fully interpreted: is this a cultic oracle, a liturgical cue, or an inner assurance? The figurative language database is only lightly used; readers would benefit from specific, cited parallels (e.g., dissolving/melting: Ps 58:8–9; 46:7; praise-in-Sheol polemic: Isa 38:18; Ps 30:10; 88:11–12; 115:17).

Missed opportunities: 
- Superscription: the midrashic “eighth” (circumcision) reading should be noted alongside instrument/mode options.
- Verse 7’s sibilant music (אַשְׂחֶה… מִטָּתִי… בְּדִמְעָתִי… עַרְשִׂי אַמְסֶה) invites a brief, precise sound observation.
- LXX differences could be used modestly to illuminate ancient reception (e.g., “on the eighth” as “ὑπὲρ ὁ ὄγδοος”).
- Liturgical use is present but needs structuring and Hebrew quotations from the prayers, showing how the tradition “reads” the psalm.

Actionable revisions:
- Define terms (colon, parallelism, chiasm, LXX, Qere/Kethib).
- Answer the macro-questions the draft raises: (1) “Sheminith,” (2) Sheol and praise, (3) what triggers the reversal, (4) why “bones,” (5) the force of רֶגַע.
- Integrate specific biblical parallels from the figurative database with citations.
- Strengthen the liturgical section with clear subsections, Hebrew prayer excerpts, and reflection on how liturgy reframes the psalm.

Overall, the draft is strong in conception; it needs crisper demonstrations, fuller use of the research bundle, and a more carefully built liturgical appendix.
