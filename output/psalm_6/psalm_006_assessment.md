# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 6

What works: The draft rightly resists the old “penitential” label by noting that Psalm 6 contains no confession and instead foregrounds illness, fragility, and the plea for healing. It also recognizes the psalm’s structural turn—vv. 9–11—where lament flips into confidence, and it insightfully traces the “terror-transfer” through the root בהל. The attention to body imagery (bones, soul, eyes) is sharp, and the discussion of Sheol theology is clear and useful. Liturgical placement is noted.

What needs work: 
- The style veers toward breathless; it sometimes tells readers that a move is “audacious” instead of showing why, with Hebrew evidence. 
- Too few parallel texts are quoted in Hebrew; readers need to see the intertexts (e.g., Isaiah 38:18; Psalms 30:10; 31:10; 88:11–12) to feel the pattern. 
- Key terms (“chiasm,” “colon,” “Niphal”) are used without definition. 
- Some claims are overstated (e.g., “identical verbal form” for בהל; the forms are clearly cognate but not identical). 
- The LXX is cited without drawing out what its choices suggest. 
- The liturgical section is promising but thin on direct quotations from the prayers. 
- The Talmudic use recorded by the Torah Temimah (Sanhedrin 107a on v. 7) is not integrated.

Actionable revisions:
- Quote the most relevant parallels in Hebrew and English (e.g., Isa 38:18; Ps 30:10; 31:10; 88:11–12; 115:17), and explain the pattern.
- Define technical terms briefly in-line.
- Ground the “assurance-oracle” turn with examples from lament psalms and quote Exodus 2:24 to illuminate “hearing.”
- Show the sound of v. 7’s sibilants with a brief, targeted transliteration (as provided).
- Expand liturgical usage with precise prayer citations and Hebrew lines (Tachanun, Kerovah for Shabbat Zachor, Seliḥot, Birkat Kohanim responses, Simanim of Rosh Hashanah).
- Integrate the Torah Temimah’s note on v. 7 as an instance of rabbinic reception.
- Incorporate a few LXX observations where it clarifies meaning (e.g., v. 10 “receives”).

Figurative language: The draft notes patterns but seldom quotes exemplars. Revisions will cite and quote Hebrew + English from Ps 31:10 (eye “wasted”), Ps 102:10 (tears as drink), and Isa 38:18 (Sheol cannot praise). Comparisons will be used to illuminate Psalm 6’s distinctive integration of medical, social, and cultic frames.
