    "What triggers the dramatic reversal between verse 8 and 9 - is this an oracle of salvation, inner assurance, or liturgical response?",
    "How does the rare word 'אֻמְלַל' (languishing) relate to similar terms in other biblical texts, and what does it suggest about the nature of the affliction?",
    "Why do the psalmist's 'bones' experience 'terror' (נִבְהֲלוּ) - what does this personification of body parts accomplish that other imagery would not?",
    "Is the theological argument in verse 6 about death and praise a genuine theological principle or a form of holy manipulation - and what does this suggest about the psalmist's relationship with God?",
    "What is the semantic difference between the two pieces of sleeping furniture ('מִטָּה' and 'עֶרֶשׂ') in verse 7, and why does the poet use both?",
    "How does 'weeping' become transformed into 'voice' (קוֹל בִּכְיִי) in verse 9, and what does this suggest about the nature of prayer and divine communication?"
