    "Why does the psalmist use both יכח 'rebuke/correct' and יסר 'discipline/chastise' in v.2 - are these true synonyms or does the pair suggest a pedagogical framework (God as teacher/discipliner) rather than merely punitive (God as judge)?",
    "Is the plea for healing (רְפָאֵנִי v.3) indicating literal physical illness, metaphorical distress, or social 'sickness' caused by enemy action? How does ancient Israelite illness theology relate to the body imagery?",
    "What is the function of the incomplete syntax in v.4 - why does עַד־מָתָי ('how long?') lack a verb, creating grammatical rupture? Is this rhetorical genius mimicking frustration or textual corruption?",
    "Why does the psalmist appeal to God's חֶסֶד (steadfast love/covenant loyalty) in v.5 rather than to צֶדֶק (righteousness) or מִשְׁפָּט (justice)? What does this choice reveal about the theological ground of the petition?",
    "How manipulative or audacious is the argument in v.6 ('save me or lose my praise') - does this reflect transactional covenant theology, rhetorical convention, or bold intimacy with God? What does this reveal about early Sheol theology?",
    "Who exactly are the 'foes' (צוֹרְרַי v.8), 'workers of iniquity' (פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן v.9), and 'enemies' (אֹיְבַי v.11) - external political enemies, false accusers in legal setting, cosmic/demonic forces, or metaphors for affliction itself?",
    "What accounts for the dramatic tonal shift between v.8 (maximum despair) and v.9 (confident dismissal of enemies) - is there a liturgical explanation (priestly oracle, sacrifice accepted), psychological breakthrough, or rhetorical device?",
    "What is the significance of the threefold שָׁמַע (hear) in vv.9-10, and what are the semantic distinctions between 'sound of weeping' (קוֹל בִּכְיִי), 'plea' (תְּחִנָּה), and 'prayer' (תְּפִלָּה) - does this progression from inarticulate to formal suggest anything about valid forms of lament?",
    "How does the verb יִקָּח 'take/receive/accept' function in v.10 - does it suggest prayer as offering that God can accept or reject, and what determines divine acceptance? Is this sacrificial metaphor?",
    "Why does the בהל 'terror' root create such precise chiastic structure (vv.3-4 → v.11) - is this deliberate compositional design showing theological reversal, or coincidental? What does terror-transfer reveal about divine justice?",
    "How does the temporal contrast between prolonged nightly suffering (כׇל־לַיְלָה v.7) and instant reversal (רָגַע v.11) function theologically - what does this say about the nature and timing of divine intervention?",
    "Is the shame vocabulary (יֵבֹשׁוּ 2x in v.11) indicating military defeat, social humiliation, psychological frustration, or divine judgment - and how does ancient Israelite honor/shame culture illuminate this?",
    "How conventional or unique is the water/tears imagery in v.7 given the Ugaritic parallel (bky/dm't word pair) - does this affect interpretation of the psalm as spontaneous prayer vs. traditional liturgical composition?",
    "What is the relationship between night-time suffering (v.7 'every night') and the absence of other temporal markers - why is suffering described as nocturnal, and does darkness function symbolically as chaos/death approach?"
