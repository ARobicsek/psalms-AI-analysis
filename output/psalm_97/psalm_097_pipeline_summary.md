## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (8)

1. How do the theophanic elements (clouds, fire, lightning, melting mountains) compare to other biblical theophanies and Ancient Near Eastern storm god imagery, and what theological significance lies in their specific combination here?
2. What is the precise meaning and scope of 'many islands' (אִיִּים רַבִּים) in v. 1 - does this refer to distant gentile nations, and how does this relate to the psalm's universal claims?
3. How does the theological paradox in v. 2 function - 'clouds and darkness around Him' yet 'righteousness and justice are the base of His throne' - and what does this reveal about divine hiddenness and moral clarity?
4. What is the identity and significance of 'all divine beings' (כׇּל־אֱלֹהִים) who bow down in v. 7 - angels, foreign deities, or both - and how does this relate to divine council imagery?
5. How does the shift from third-person description (vv. 1-7) to second-person address (vv. 8-9) and back to third-person (vv. 10-12) function rhetorically and theologically?
6. What is the agricultural metaphor's significance in 'Light is sown for the righteous' (v. 11), and how does this 'sowing' imagery relate to divine providence and eschatological hope?
7. How does Psalm 97 relate to other 'YHWH malak' psalms (93, 96, 97, 98, 99) in terms of shared themes, vocabulary, and theological development?
8. What is the relationship between 'judgments' (מִשְׁפָּטֶיךָ) in v. 8 and the earlier 'justice' (מִשְׁפָּט) in v. 2, and how do these terms function in the psalm's moral theology?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (7)

1. Why does the psalm specify 'many islands' (אִיִּים רַבִּים) rather than 'all nations' - does this reflect maritime trade routes or eschatological geography?
2. How does the theological paradox in v.2 function - can divine hiddenness (clouds/darkness) and moral clarity (righteousness/justice foundation) coexist?
3. What is the identity and significance of 'all divine beings' (כׇּל־אֱלֹהִים) in v.7 - angels, foreign deities, or divine council members?
4. Why does light get 'sown' (זָרֻעַ) in v.11 - is this agricultural metaphor about delayed harvest, hidden growth, or providential planting?
5. How does the double מִלִּפְנֵי (at the presence of) in v.5 function poetically and theologically - mere emphasis or escalating revelation?
6. Why do the heavens 'proclaim' righteousness while peoples only 'see' glory (v.6) - different types of divine revelation?
7. What triggers the shift from cosmic scope (vv.1-6) to particular focus on Zion/Judah (v.8) - is this liturgical, theological, or poetic necessity?
