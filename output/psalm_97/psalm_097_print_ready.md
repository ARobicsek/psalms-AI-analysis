# Commentary on Psalm 97
---
## Introduction
“The LORD has become king”—that is how Psalm 97 begins in Hebrew: `yhwh mālāk`. The verb form is a perfect, which in biblical poetry can signal a present reality, a liturgical proclamation, or a felt future (“has taken the throne,” “reigns now”). The ambiguity is part of the point. The psalm is not a constitutional document; it is a summons. What follows is a choreography of seeing and hearing—lightning, fire, cloud, mountains liquefying—that moves from the horizon of the world down to the streets of Judah, where joy and ethics take root.
A handful of terms will help. By “theophany” I mean a dramatic appearance of God in storm imagery. By “parallelism” I mean the way Hebrew poetry places two lines (poetic cola) in relationship so the second restates, sharpens, or advances the first—“A is so, and what’s more, B.” “Inclusio” is the device of opening and closing with similar notes (here, two calls to rejoice), bracketing the argument. The MT (“Masoretic Text”) is the standard Hebrew; the LXX (“Septuagint”) is the early Greek translation, often illuminating how ancient readers understood a passage.
The opening claim that “the earth exults” and “the many islands rejoice” (v. 1) is not generic cheer. The rare phrase `iyyim rabbim` (many “coastlands/islands”) occurs elsewhere with Tyre’s far-flung trade (Ezekiel 27:15). Isaiah similarly uses “the coastlands” as a cipher for distant peoples at the edge of the map. In other words, the psalmist targets the far places where other powers seem to hold sway. The summons crosses water—the ancient emblem of chaos and limit—to announce that even those “coastlands” fall within the king’s compass.
Then comes the paradox that governs the poem (v. 2): God is wrapped in “cloud and thick darkness” (`ʿānān wa-ʿărāfel`), Sinai’s visible invisibility (Exodus 20:21; Deuteronomy 4:11), yet the base of the throne (`mĕkōn kisseʾ) is “righteousness and justice.” The same formula anchors Psalm 89:14. The imagery is deliberate. Israel knew storm-god pictures from its neighbors—Baal striding the clouds—but Psalm 97 repurposes the storm. The cloud is not theatrical smoke; it bespeaks mystery. The fire (v. 3) is not spectacle; it is judicial. The lightning (v. 4) is not a light show; it is revelation that provokes the earth to writhe. The mountain—our emblem of permanence—melts “like wax” (v. 5), a simile used elsewhere for judgment (Micah 1:4; Psalm 68:2) and dread (Psalm 22:15). Power is not denied; it is moralized.
The middle of the psalm reframes the audience. Nature “proclaims” (`higgîdû`) God’s righteousness (v. 6), while the nations “see” glory. This pairing is almost a refrain in the theophanic psalms (compare Psalm 50:6). But the decisive turn comes in verse 7: idolaters are shamed, while “all `elohim` bow down to him.” Who are these `elohim`? In the Hebrew Bible the word ranges from the true God to heaven’s court to the “gods” of the nations. Ancient readers already felt the problem. The LXX renders “angels,” and the New Testament quotes that Greek in Hebrews 1:6 to say, “Let all God’s angels worship him.” The psalm itself presses toward a council scene: whatever beings people have worshiped and whatever powers preside over the nations (Psalm 82’s “sons of the Most High”), they are not rivals. They bow.
At this point the geography narrows. Zion hears, Judah’s towns rejoice (v. 8). Why? “Because of your judgments.” It is a crucial theological move. Universal sovereignty has a local consequence. The God whose throne rests on justice judges in particular, and the covenant community exults not in pyrotechnics but in moral order: wrongs righted, idols overturned.
From this recognition flows an imperative (v. 10): “You who love the LORD, hate evil.” This is not the fever of zealotry. It is moral alignment. The same God who unseats mountains “guards the lives of his `ḥasidim`”—his loyal ones (BDB: those who practice `ḥesed`, covenant faithfulness). The world is not a theater in which we watch God perform. It is a school for love and hatred properly directed.
Then, a curious image: “Light is sown for the righteous” (v. 11). The MT’s “sown” (`zāruaʿ`) perplexed ancient translators; the LXX reads “light has dawned.” Both metaphors have pedigree. “Dawning light” fits the storm breaking. But “sown light” is the more arresting line. It suggests delay and hiddenness. The field is planted long before harvest. Rashi takes it as “real sowing,” prepared to grow. The Radak pushes it into messianic time: the righteous will reap later what is now entrusted to the soil. The Torah Temimah catches a rabbinic play: “Not all are for light, not all for joy—‘righteous’ to light, ‘upright’ to joy” (Taʿanit). The poet keeps both: moral patience (“sown”) and present glimmer (“light”).
Psalm 97 belongs to the cluster of “YHWH reigns” psalms (93, 96–99). Together they insist that kingship is not merely cosmic steadiness or cultic pageantry. It is a claim about the nature of reality: that the One who comes in cloud and flame does not merely topple what we fear but underwrites what we hope. If the psalm’s last word is “holy memorial” (v. 12)—`lĕzēker qodsho`, echoing Exodus 3:15’s “this is my memorial forever”—that is because memory is moral. We remember not a show but a character, not a spectacle but a throne founded on right.
A final note on form. The poem is framed by joy (vv. 1, 12), an inclusio that gathers all the intervening thunder into worship. The device is not saccharine; it is argumentative. The earth’s “exultation” becomes the righteous community’s “rejoicing,” and the “coastlands” yield to “Zion.” Majesty is not an abstraction. It arrives, melts what must melt, and plants light.

## Verse-by-Verse Commentary
Note on terms used below:
- “Colon” = one line of Hebrew poetic parallelism; a bicolon is a two-line unit.
- “MT” = Masoretic (Hebrew) Text; “LXX” = Septuagint (ancient Greek translation).
- “Theophany” = dramatic manifestation of God, often with storm imagery.
- “Inclusio” = bracketing a unit with repeated words or themes.
**Verse 1**
Hebrew: ה׳ מָלָךְ תָּגֵל הָאָרֶץ יִשְׂמְחוּ אִיִּים רַבִּים.
The opening formula, `yhwh mālāk`—“the LORD has become king” or simply “the LORD reigns”—belongs to a small psalmic family (93, 96–99). The perfect verb can signal an enduring fact proclaimed afresh. The parallel cola model a classic “A is so, and what’s more, B”: the earth is summoned to “exult,” and then the camera pans to the “many islands,” the far coasts.
The phrase `iyyim rabbim` is unusually pointed. As the concordance shows, the exact collocation appears elsewhere only in Ezekiel 27:15, where Tyre’s mercantile reach extends to “many coastlands.” In Isaiah, “coastlands” regularly denote distant peoples (e.g., Isaiah 41:1, 5; 42:10). The psalmist intentionally pushes the claim of divine kingship to the map’s edges—over the sea, which ancient imagination associated with threat and limit. This is not a warm-up chorus; it is a polemical geography.
Parallelism here is nearly synonymous but escalatory: “exult” (`tāgēl`) and “rejoice” (`yismĕḥū`) are paired verbs of gladness; the second colon specifies who, precisely, must join the celebration. The rhetorical force is sharp: if even the far islands—outposts of other deities and sovereignties—are called to sing, no nearer realm is exempt.
Comparative note: Psalm 96:10 announces the same formula among the nations and immediately links it to judgment (“He will judge the peoples with equity”). Psalm 97 will make that connection explicit in its theophanic core (vv. 2–6) and ethical tailpiece (vv. 10–12). The rhetorical flow—from universal summons to specific consequence—begins here.
Sound is incidental but apt: the repeated long “i” of `’iyyîm` (islands) and `rabbîm` (many) creates a tick-tock of reach and multiplicity. More importantly, the verse sets the psalm’s inclusio with v. 12: the opening “exult/rejoice” (universal) will return as a concluding “rejoice/give thanks” (particular), bracketing the argument that joy properly belongs to both earth and covenant.
**Verse 2**
Hebrew: עָנָן וַעֲרָפֶל סְבִיבָיו; צֶדֶק וּמִשְׁפָּט מְכוֹן כִּסְאוֹ.
Here the psalm speaks in paradox. God is encircled by “cloud and thick darkness” (`ʿānān wa-ʿărāfel`), vocabulary drawn straight from Sinai’s theophany (Exodus 20:21; Deuteronomy 4:11; 5:22). The darkness does not negate presence; it marks it. The second colon grounds the vision: “righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.” The term `mĕkōn` (BDB: fixed place, base) is architectural—what everything rests on (compare Psalm 89:14; also Psalm 104:5 for “foundations” of the earth).
This pair—wrapping mystery around ethical clarity—is the psalm’s thesis. In Israel’s world, storm-god images were familiar; Baal rides the clouds. Psalm 97 refuses the equation of power with caprice. The darkness signals that God is not at our disposal; the throne’s base announces that His rule is not arbitrary. Medieval readers heard this tension. Radak: the obscurity is for the wicked; the justice is shown in the judgments that follow. Malbim goes further: God’s providence often works “behind” nature’s veil (the clouds), yet that governance is ordered to justice.
A pattern worth noting: the psalm will oscillate between what is seen and what is known. Lightning will “illuminate” (v. 4), but it is the heavens that “declare righteousness” (v. 6). The throne’s “foundation” is a conceptual given—an assertion about reality—revealed through the storm.
Figurative parallels: the storm-theophany palette (cloud, darkness, fire) recurs in Zephaniah 1:15; Joel 2:2, and in older poetry (2 Samuel 22:10; Psalm 18). Psalm 97’s distinctiveness is the explicit binding of that palette to the throne’s moral base.
**Verse 3**
Hebrew: אֵשׁ לְפָנָיו תֵּלֵךְ; וּתְלַהֵט סָבִיב צָרָיו.
Fire “goes before” Him—language of a royal vanguard—and “blazes” (`tĕlaḥēt`, BDB: to flame up) around His enemies. The anthropomorphic grammar (“walks”) is intentional: fire becomes God’s herald and instrument. The natural and judicial dimensions overlay. Compare Psalm 50:3: “Our God comes… a devouring fire precedes him”; Deuteronomy 4:24: “the LORD your God is a consuming fire.” In priestly narrative, “fire came out from before the LORD” to accept an offering (Leviticus 9:24) and, in judgment, to consume Nadab and Abihu (Leviticus 10:2). “From before” (מִלִּפְנֵי) can mark cultic nearness as well as lethal proximity.
Psalm 97 fuses these registers. The vanguard fire is not spectacle but sentence. Rashi ties this to eschatological warfare (Gog and Magog; Ezekiel 38:22); whether or not we share that horizon, the verse’s function is to prepare the way for moral action in history. The encirclement “around his enemies” (`sābîb tsārāyw`) suggests inescapability. There is no gap to slip through when fire is the perimeter.
The vanguard motif has cousins. Psalm 85:14 pictures “justice going before him,” laying a path for God’s steps. In Psalm 97 it is literal fire, but the logic is the same: what comes first advertises the character of the king.
Distinctiveness: elsewhere, fire can be essence-metaphor (“God is a consuming fire”). Here the fire is agent. That distinction matters for the psalm’s argument: sovereignty is not a bare attribute; it is enacted as judgment.
**Verse 4**
Hebrew: הֵאִירוּ בְרָקָיו תֵּבֵל; רָאֲתָה וַתָּחֵל הָאָרֶץ.
“His lightnings lit up the world; the earth saw and writhed.” The first colon presents lightning as revealing illumination (`hēʾîrū`). The second offers an arresting reaction-verb: `wa-tāḥēl` from `ḥûl` (BDB: writhe, tremble, often with birth pangs). The sequence seeing → convulsing is causal. The world does not shrug at disclosure; it labors under it.
The figurative pattern is common in theophany: creation trembles when God appears. Psalm 77:17 provides a striking parallel with the same verb: “the waters saw You… the waters saw You and writhed” (יָחִילוּ), “the deeps also quaked.” Judges 5:4 and Psalm 68:8 similarly picture earth in motion at divine advance. Psalm 97’s addition is the emphasis on vision: it is the sight of lightning that triggers the convulsion. Revelation is not sterile. It is visceral.
Medieval readings mine the psychology. Radak: people, seeing such phenomena, will recognize divine justice; Meiri adds that the shock will bring many to return to God. The psalm itself remains in the register of creation. It is not human fright alone but earth’s reactive labor that signals the gravity of the arrival.
The diction is tight. `Tēbēl` (“world,” the inhabited land) answers the “earth” (`hāʾārets`) of v. 1; the poet’s geography maintains its universal scope even as the emotional register intensifies.
**Verse 5**
Hebrew: הָרִים כַּדּוֹנַג נָמַסּוּ מִלִּפְנֵי ה׳, מִלִּפְנֵי אֲדוֹן כָּל־הָאָרֶץ.
“The mountains melted like wax before the LORD, before the lord of all the earth.” The simile is vivid and never trite: mountains are our shorthand for what lasts. To picture them liquefying “like wax” (`dōnagh`) is to say no created solidity resists the Presence. This is the stock theophanic image for judgment: Micah 1:4 (“as wax before the fire”), Psalm 68:2 (“as wax melts before fire, so the wicked perish before God”). Psalm 22:15 employs it psychologically: “my heart is like wax.”
What is special here is the double anaphora of “before” (`millipnê… millipnê`) and the titular escalation: “before the LORD” (the covenant name) and “before the lord of all the earth.” The second title (`ʾadōn kol-hāʾārets`) universalizes the theophany; the God who appears is not a mountain god to his own peak but master of every land. The “before” formula flags the cultic/cosmic interface. In priestly texts, humans stand “before the LORD” in sanctuary; here, creation itself is dragged into that proximity and cannot hold its shape.
Medieval interpreters often read “mountains” metonymically as tyrants (Radak, Metzudat David). The political reading can coexist with the literal. The psalm leans on the physical to say something about the moral: the most entrenched obstacles—geological or imperial—cannot withstand the day of justice.
A concordance note: “from before the LORD” (מִלִּפְנֵי ה׳) regularly marks decisive moments (Leviticus 9:24; 10:2; Jonah 1:3). Psalm 97 places the entire created order under that signature.
**Verse 6**
Hebrew: הִגִּידוּ הַשָּׁמַיִם צִדְקוֹ; וְרָאוּ כָּל־הָעַמִּים כְּבוֹדוֹ.
“The heavens proclaimed his righteousness; all peoples saw his glory.” The verbs divide labor: heaven “announces” (`higgîdū`)—the same root used of prophetic declaration—while humanity “sees.” The effect is not passivity versus activity so much as theater versus herald. Creation is a witness with a voice; nations are spectators with eyes.
This line should be read beside Psalm 19:1 (“the heavens declare the glory of God”) and especially Psalm 50:6 (“the heavens declare his righteousness”), both within the theophanic/judicial register. There, as here, “heavens” serve as courtroom witnesses to God’s rightness in judgment. The second colon universalizes the audience: “all peoples.” The psalm maintains its argument’s breadth even as it moves toward a verdict on idolatry.
Ibn Ezra’s thought—“the inhabitants of heaven” (angels) proclaim—represents an old interpretive move; Radak grounds the proclamation in phenomena (hail, fire) that become, as it were, heaven’s testimony. The theological net result is the same: the moral foundation of the throne (v. 2) is not a human wish. It is the structure within which the world itself speaks.
The pairing of `tsidqo` (his righteousness) and `kĕvōdō` (his glory) is not ornamental. “Glory” is weight; “righteousness” is right order. Psalm 97 insists they go together: God is glorious not because He overwhelms but because He judges rightly.
**Verse 7**
Hebrew: יֵבֹשׁוּ כָּל־עֹבְדֵי פֶסֶל, הַמִּתְהַלְלִים בָּאֱלִילִים; הִשְׁתַּחֲווּ־לוֹ כָּל־אֱלֹקִים.
“Let all who serve an image be put to shame, those who boast in nothings (`’elîlîm`); bow down to him, all `elohim`.” The verse turns from creation to cult. The punning contrast of `’elohim` / `’elîlîm` (as in Psalm 96:5) is sharp: the objects of pride are “nothings.” The first colon’s jussive (“let them be shamed”) matches the second’s imperative (“bow down…”), forming a double demand: humiliation below, homage above.
Who are the “all `elohim`”? The word ranges widely: the true God; members of the heavenly council (Psalm 82:1, 6); or the gods of the nations. The LXX translates “angels” (ἄγγελοι), a reading cited in Hebrews 1:6. Medieval Jewish readers often take them as the heavenly host worshiped by the nations (Radak; Metzudat David). The psalm’s own rhetoric gestures to a council scene: whatever powers populate the unseen realm—real beings, not “nothings”—bend the knee. Meanwhile, human idolaters are exposed as self-deluded boasters (`hammit’hallĕlîm`, reflexive: “vaunting themselves”).
Comparative note: the verse crystallizes what the theophany implies. Psalm 82 imagines God judging among `elohim`; Psalm 97 makes the outcome liturgical. The shame (`yēbōšū`) echoes a stock biblical reaction to misplaced trust (Deuteronomy 32:21; Isaiah 2:18). The psalm thus binds storm and sanctuary: the same arrival that melts mountains unseats counterfeit worship.
Distinctive here is the double audience—earthly worshipers and heavenly beings—and the play of commands. The line does not debate idols; it stages their collapse.
**Verse 8**
Hebrew: שָׁמְעָה וַתִּשְׂמַח צִיּוֹן; וַתָּגֵלְנָה בְּנוֹת יְהוּדָה לְמַעַן מִשְׁפָּטֶיךָ ה׳.
“Zion heard and rejoiced; the daughters of Judah exulted, because of your judgments, O LORD.” The geography narrows without parochialism. Having summoned earth and islands, the poet pivots to Zion and its daughter towns. The motive clause is key: not because “we won,” but “because of your judgments.” The moral center of v. 2 becomes cause for local joy.
Note the rhetorical shift from third person to second (“your judgments”), intimacy replacing narration. Traditional Jewish interpreters sometimes locate those judgments at the valley of Jehoshaphat (Radak), but the line does not require eschatological mapping. It requires moral imagination: if the heavens declare righteousness (v. 6), what do God’s people do? They rejoice.
“Daughters of Judah” is a familiar idiom for surrounding towns. The parallelism is synonymous and inclusive: Zion and its satellites. The vocabulary of joy (`ś-m-ḥ`, `g-y-l`) reprises v. 1, knitting the inclusio’s outer and inner edges.
The verse also hints at providential modes. Malbim contrasts God’s general governance through nature with special care for Zion through overt providence. Psalm 97 keeps the two linked. The storm that upends the world’s false worship is the same storm that leaves Zion singing.
**Verse 9**
Hebrew: כִּי־אַתָּה ה׳ עֶלְיוֹן עַל־כָּל־הָאָרֶץ; מְאֹד נַעֲלֵיתָ עַל־כָּל־אֱלֹקִים.
“For you, LORD, are `Elyon`—Most High—over all the earth; you are exceedingly exalted above all `elohim`.” This verse clinches the hierarchy implicit in v. 7. The epithet `ʿElyon` appears widely for Israel’s God and, in Psalm 82:6, for the “sons of the Most High,” who are nevertheless judged. Here the title is exclusive. Two spheres are named: “all the earth” (geography) and “all `elohim`” (ontology). YHWH is sovereign over both.
The second colon’s verb `naʿălêta` adds the nuance of self-exaltation being recognized (“you have lifted yourself high”). The adverb `mĕʾod` (“exceedingly”) underscores degree. The psalm is not diffident about hierarchy. It resolves the “divine beings” question not by denying their existence but by placing them definitively below.
Reception history matters. The LXX’s “angels” for v. 7 and the title `ʿElyon` here formed the scaffolding for later Jewish and Christian reflections on a heavenly court dependent on the Most High. The psalm’s own emphasis is not cosmography but worship: the right objects of reverence have been distinguished from the wrong.
Structural note: vv. 7–9 form a unit: idolaters (shamed), `elohim` (bow), YHWH (Most High). The movement is downward for pretenders, downward for powers, upward for God.
**Verse 10**
Hebrew: אֹהֲבֵי ה׳ שִׂנְאוּ רָע; שֹׁמֵר נַפְשׁוֹת חֲסִידָיו; מִיַּד רְשָׁעִים יַצִּילֵם.
“You who love the LORD, hate evil. He guards the lives of his `ḥasidim` (faithful); from the hand of the wicked he rescues them.” The psalm now addresses a human audience directly. The imperative is moral alignment: love entails hatred rightly directed. One cannot love God abstractly and remain neutral about what corrodes his world.
The motivation follows. God “guards” (`shōmēr`, participle: ongoing) the lives (`nafshōt`) of his `ḥasidim`—a term that, in Psalms especially, denotes those loyal to the covenant (BDB). The participial form suggests habitual care, not occasional intervention. The rescue clause (“from the hand of the wicked”) concretizes the promise: divine kingship has deliverance as its practical effect.
This verse binds the theophany to ethics. The God who topples mountains also keeps persons. Ibn Ezra draws the inference: do not fear evildoers; only God guards souls. Malbim distinguishes the special providence over the faithful from the general governance of the nations—a distinction that explains both the universality of vv. 1–6 and the particularity of vv. 8, 12.
Comparative note: the love/hate pairing is a wisdom trope (cf. Amos 5:15: “hate evil, love good”). Here it sits at the seam between cosmic hymn and communal instruction, translating thunder into resolve.
**Verse 11**
Hebrew: אוֹר זָרֻעַ לַצַּדִּיק; וּלְיִשְׁרֵי־לֵב שִׂמְחָה.
“Light is sown for the righteous, and for the upright of heart, joy.” The MT’s “is sown” (`zāruaʿ`) creates a striking metaphor: an immaterial good treated as seed. Sowing implies hiddenness, patience, and eventual harvest. Rashi takes it literally (“real sowing”)—the light is prepared to grow. Radak pushes the harvest into the messianic future: sown here, reaped there. The Torah Temimah, noting the double predicate, cites a rabbinic nuance: “Not all to light and not all to joy—‘righteous’ to light, ‘upright’ to joy” (Taʿanit), reading the parallelism not as mere repetition but as distributed promise.
Textual note: the LXX reads “light has dawned for the righteous” (φῶς ἀνέτειλεν), presupposing `zāraḥ` (“to shine”) rather than `zāraʿ` (“to sow”). Both are plausible in Hebrew. Each emphasizes different timing: the Greek offers immediacy (the storm breaks into morning), the MT offers latency (light entrusted to time). Given the psalm’s pairing of hidden governance (v. 2) with manifest right, MT’s “sown” is poetically apt.
Comparative imagery: light as blessing or salvation is common (Psalm 112:4; Isaiah 60:1–3). Sowing as metaphor for delayed outcome appears in Hosea 10:12 (“sow righteousness, reap steadfast love”) and Psalm 126:5 (“those who sow in tears will reap with shouts of joy”). Psalm 97’s originality lies in grafting these metaphors: the light itself is seed.
The parallelism (“righteous” / “upright of heart”) is not redundant. The first term leans toward public conduct; the second toward interior integrity. The verse blesses both posture and practice.
**Verse 12**
Hebrew: שִׂמְחוּ צַדִּיקִים בַּה׳; וְהוֹדוּ לְזֵכֶר קָדְשׁוֹ.
“Rejoice, righteous ones, in the LORD; and give thanks to the memorial of his holiness.” The psalm closes where it began, with joy—but now addressed not to earth and islands, but to “righteous ones.” The universal summons has become a particular vocation. Inclusio is not mere symmetry; it is development.
The phrase `lĕzēker qodsho` deserves a word. `Zēker` can mean “remembrance” or the “memorial” that triggers it. In Exodus 3:15 God says, “This is my name forever, and this is my memorial (`zēker`) to all generations.” Here, “the memorial of his holiness” is the name by which God is remembered—above all, the acts that reveal the holy character we have just watched: judgments that put the world right, protection for the faithful, light stored up.
Malbim is probably right to hear in “holiness” more than generic piety: “holiness” marks God’s otherness and, for Israel, the miracles that outstrip nature. But the psalm has insisted throughout that what outstrips nature aims at justice. To “give thanks to the memorial of his holiness” is to remember a history in which theophany and ethics meet.
Structurally, v. 12 returns the verbs of joy (`simḥū`) and thanks (`hōdū`) that opened the psalm’s sister pieces (e.g., Psalm 96:1–2). Psalm 97 adapts them to a community formed by what it has just witnessed: fire before him, mountains undone, heavens testifying, idols shamed, Zion rejoicing, evil hated, light planted.
One more turn of the screw: the psalm’s movement—from universal to particular—suggests something about memory. Memory is not nostalgia; it is moral orientation. The holy memorial is a compass. To rejoice in the LORD is to learn to love what He loves and hate what He hates. The storm clears, and the path is visible.
