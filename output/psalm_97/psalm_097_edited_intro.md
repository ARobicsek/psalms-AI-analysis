“The LORD has become king”—that is how Psalm 97 begins in Hebrew: `yhwh mālāk`. The verb form is a perfect, which in biblical poetry can signal a present reality, a liturgical proclamation, or a felt future (“has taken the throne,” “reigns now”). The ambiguity is part of the point. The psalm is not a constitutional document; it is a summons. What follows is a choreography of seeing and hearing—lightning, fire, cloud, mountains liquefying—that moves from the horizon of the world down to the streets of Judah, where joy and ethics take root.

A handful of terms will help. By “theophany” I mean a dramatic appearance of God in storm imagery. By “parallelism” I mean the way Hebrew poetry places two lines (poetic cola) in relationship so the second restates, sharpens, or advances the first—“A is so, and what’s more, B.” “Inclusio” is the device of opening and closing with similar notes (here, two calls to rejoice), bracketing the argument. The MT (“Masoretic Text”) is the standard Hebrew; the LXX (“Septuagint”) is the early Greek translation, often illuminating how ancient readers understood a passage.

The opening claim that “the earth exults” and “the many islands rejoice” (v. 1) is not generic cheer. The rare phrase `iyyim rabbim` (many “coastlands/islands”) occurs elsewhere with Tyre’s far-flung trade (Ezekiel 27:15). Isaiah similarly uses “the coastlands” as a cipher for distant peoples at the edge of the map. In other words, the psalmist targets the far places where other powers seem to hold sway. The summons crosses water—the ancient emblem of chaos and limit—to announce that even those “coastlands” fall within the king’s compass.

Then comes the paradox that governs the poem (v. 2): God is wrapped in “cloud and thick darkness” (`ʿānān wa-ʿărāfel`), Sinai’s visible invisibility (Exodus 20:21; Deuteronomy 4:11), yet the base of the throne (`mĕkōn kisseʾ) is “righteousness and justice.” The same formula anchors Psalm 89:14. The imagery is deliberate. Israel knew storm-god pictures from its neighbors—Baal striding the clouds—but Psalm 97 repurposes the storm. The cloud is not theatrical smoke; it bespeaks mystery. The fire (v. 3) is not spectacle; it is judicial. The lightning (v. 4) is not a light show; it is revelation that provokes the earth to writhe. The mountain—our emblem of permanence—melts “like wax” (v. 5), a simile used elsewhere for judgment (Micah 1:4; Psalm 68:2) and dread (Psalm 22:15). Power is not denied; it is moralized.

The middle of the psalm reframes the audience. Nature “proclaims” (`higgîdû`) God’s righteousness (v. 6), while the nations “see” glory. This pairing is almost a refrain in the theophanic psalms (compare Psalm 50:6). But the decisive turn comes in verse 7: idolaters are shamed, while “all `elohim` bow down to him.” Who are these `elohim`? In the Hebrew Bible the word ranges from the true God to heaven’s court to the “gods” of the nations. Ancient readers already felt the problem. The LXX renders “angels,” and the New Testament quotes that Greek in Hebrews 1:6 to say, “Let all God’s angels worship him.” The psalm itself presses toward a council scene: whatever beings people have worshiped and whatever powers preside over the nations (Psalm 82’s “sons of the Most High”), they are not rivals. They bow.

At this point the geography narrows. Zion hears, Judah’s towns rejoice (v. 8). Why? “Because of your judgments.” It is a crucial theological move. Universal sovereignty has a local consequence. The God whose throne rests on justice judges in particular, and the covenant community exults not in pyrotechnics but in moral order: wrongs righted, idols overturned.

From this recognition flows an imperative (v. 10): “You who love the LORD, hate evil.” This is not the fever of zealotry. It is moral alignment. The same God who unseats mountains “guards the lives of his `ḥasidim`”—his loyal ones (BDB: those who practice `ḥesed`, covenant faithfulness). The world is not a theater in which we watch God perform. It is a school for love and hatred properly directed.

Then, a curious image: “Light is sown for the righteous” (v. 11). The MT’s “sown” (`zāruaʿ`) perplexed ancient translators; the LXX reads “light has dawned.” Both metaphors have pedigree. “Dawning light” fits the storm breaking. But “sown light” is the more arresting line. It suggests delay and hiddenness. The field is planted long before harvest. Rashi takes it as “real sowing,” prepared to grow. The Radak pushes it into messianic time: the righteous will reap later what is now entrusted to the soil. The Torah Temimah catches a rabbinic play: “Not all are for light, not all for joy—‘righteous’ to light, ‘upright’ to joy” (Taʿanit). The poet keeps both: moral patience (“sown”) and present glimmer (“light”).

Psalm 97 belongs to the cluster of “YHWH reigns” psalms (93, 96–99). Together they insist that kingship is not merely cosmic steadiness or cultic pageantry. It is a claim about the nature of reality: that the One who comes in cloud and flame does not merely topple what we fear but underwrites what we hope. If the psalm’s last word is “holy memorial” (v. 12)—`lĕzēker qodsho`, echoing Exodus 3:15’s “this is my memorial forever”—that is because memory is moral. We remember not a show but a character, not a spectacle but a throne founded on right.

A final note on form. The poem is framed by joy (vv. 1, 12), an inclusio that gathers all the intervening thunder into worship. The device is not saccharine; it is argumentative. The earth’s “exultation” becomes the righteous community’s “rejoicing,” and the “coastlands” yield to “Zion.” Majesty is not an abstraction. It arrives, melts what must melt, and plants light.
