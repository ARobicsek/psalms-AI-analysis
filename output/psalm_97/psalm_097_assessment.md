# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 97

The draft captures the psalm’s big idea with admirable clarity: Psalm 97 binds storm-theophany to moral order. It tracks the poem’s arc from universal scope to communal ethics and rightly highlights the tension of verse 2—God hidden in “cloud and thick darkness” yet enthroned on “righteousness and justice.” Its verse notes are generally careful, bring in classical Jewish commentators effectively, and point to several useful lexical and concordance observations (e.g., the rarity of “many islands”).

Still, revision is needed in four areas.

- Missing reception and textual insights. The most consequential oversight is Psalm 97:7: the LXX’s “angels” for כָּל־אֱלֹהִים and its reuse in Hebrews 1:6. Verse 11 likewise requires discussion of the LXX’s “light has dawned” (ἀνέτειλεν) versus MT “is sown.” These are not merely curiosities; they shape how readers have understood the psalm for millennia. Verse 6 should be set beside Psalm 50:6 (“the heavens declare his righteousness”), a tight parallel in the same theophanic register.

- Figurative language should be more comparative and precise. The commentary cites some cross-references but often stops at description. The “melting mountains” simile must be read against Micah 1:4 and Psalm 68:2; “fire before him” against Psalm 50:3 and Deuteronomy 4:24; “convulsed” against Psalm 77:17. These comparisons show what is distinctive about Psalm 97’s usage and why.

- Occasional overemphasis on sound-effects. Not every verse merits prosodic analysis, and when it does, the observation should be anchored in the provided stress-marking. Select a few strong instances; otherwise the music of the language becomes noise.

- Define terms for lay readers; situate claims. Terms like “theophany,” “inclusio,” “colon,” “MT,” and “LXX” must be briefly explained. Some claims (e.g., ANE storm-god comparisons) should be anchored with a sentence on how Psalm 97 adapts that stock imagery.

What to add: the divine council frame (Psalms 82; 89) for vv. 7–9; the inclusio formed by universal and particular calls to rejoice (vv. 1, 12); the “before the LORD” formula (מִלִּפְנֵי) as a theophanic marker with cultic echoes (Leviticus 9:24; 10:2); Malbim’s useful contrast between hidden natural governance and overt providence; Torah Temimah on v. 11 (“not all to light, not all to joy”). With these revisions, the commentary will be both sharper and more inviting.
