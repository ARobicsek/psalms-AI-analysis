# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 10

What works: The draft introduction rightly foregrounds Psalm 10’s broken acrostic with Psalm 9, the three “he says in his heart” monologues, the verb-play on darash (“seek/call to account”), and the pivot at “You do see” (v.14). The commentary shows sensitivity to spatial imagery (“standing far,” “judgments high”) and to the predator motif.

Weaknesses: 
- The LXX lines printed under verses are unrelated or garbled; better to avoid quoting them and simply note the LXX’s fusion of Psalms 9–10. 
- Several promising claims are not demonstrated with quoted Hebrew texts. Readers need to see the evidence. This is especially acute for the figurative language parallels (lion, nets, hidden face), where the research bundle offers superb cross-references that were not quoted. 
- The liturgical section is informative but thin on Hebrew prayer citations and does not consistently show how the verse functions in its prayer setting. 
- Some grammatical observations drift into jargon; terms like “perfect” or “jussive” need quick, plain-English glosses.
- Missed opportunities: the Torah Temimah’s halakhic/aggadic uses (Ps 10:3; 10:15) deserve quotation; the rare word חֵלְכָה needs explanation; v.10’s Ketiv/Qere should be fully unpacked; the related psalms (7, 31, 44, 74, 94) should be put to work with Hebrew quotations.

Answerable questions from the Macro/Micro analysis that should be addressed:
- The three “אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ” quotes and their rhetorical progression (vv. 6, 11, 13) can be clarified by quoting Ps 14:1 as a canon-wide foil. 
- The darash triad (vv. 4, 13, 15) should be set out with Hebrew and explained as legal “calling to account.” 
- Figurative language: quote Ps 7:3; 64:5; 94:9; Deut 31:17–18 to illuminate lion, ambush, and hidden-face imagery; quote Jer 48:25; Ezek 30:21–22 on “breaking the arm.” 
- Liturgical use: quote the Yehi Kevod string (with 10:16), High Holiday piyyutim using 10:17, the Yom Kippur Avodah piyyut using 10:15, and Selichot using 10:1.

Stylistically, the prose should maintain confidence while teaching—showing the Hebrew, translating it, and avoiding insider shorthand. With those revisions, the essay and commentary can become both elegant and persuasive.
