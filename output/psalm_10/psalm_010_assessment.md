# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 10

What works: The draft introduction perceptively links Psalm 10 to Psalm 9 as a broken acrostic and rightly frames the poem as a sustained meditation on divine hiddenness countered by liturgical assertion. It tracks the psalm’s psychological center with the three “he says in his heart” speeches and notices the verb darash (“seek/call to account”) as a structural hinge. The commentary is rich, generally accurate, and attentive to diction, idiom, and rhetoric. It often integrates medieval Jewish exegesis and occasionally notes liturgical reception.

What needs revision: 
- Parallels and liturgical uses are frequently cited without quotations. Sophisticated readers want to see the Hebrew. We should quote biblical parallels (e.g., Ps 9–10, 13:2; 94:9; Deut 31:17) and prayer citations (Yehi Kevod; High Holiday piyyutim; Selichot; Seder HaAvodah).
- A few grammatical matters need tightening (e.g., the syntax of אין אֱלֹהִים כׇּל־מְזִמּוֹתָיו; the jussive force in v. 2; the perfect in v. 14 as a rhetorical “perfect of conviction”). Define technical terms (acrostic, colon, jussive, perfect/perfective, prophetic perfect) in-line.
- Some LXX material in the provided “Psalm Text” appears misaligned; avoid relying on those lines. It is safe—and important—to note that the LXX merges Psalms 9–10.
- Missed opportunities: the Torah Temimah’s halakhic/agadic uses (Bava Kamma 94a; Megillah 17b) deserve quotation. Figurative language parallels (lion, net, hidden face) should be demonstrated with at least one Hebrew/English example apiece. Related psalms (31, 44, 74, 94) can be used to sharpen the psalm’s argument through brief, quoted cross-references.
- The liturgical section needs restructuring: specific headings, Hebrew citations from the prayers, and explanation of how the liturgy repurposes the verses.

Action plan:
- Revise the introduction to define terms, anchor claims with quotations, and answer obvious questions (e.g., why “nations” in v. 16, what “prophetic perfect” accomplishes, the semantics of darash).
- Rework verse notes to begin with punctuated Hebrew, add parallel quotations, integrate rabbinic and liturgical reception (with Hebrew), and clarify syntax where needed.
- Build the liturgical section with proper subheadings, Hebrew excerpts, and brief theological reflection on reception.

Figurative language: The current draft often cites patterns without quoting. The revision will show them (e.g., Ps 64:5; 9:16; 13:2; 94:9) and compare Psalm 10’s distinctive use.
