If Psalm 9 is the victory montage, Psalm 10 is the camera that stays behind in the alley. It opens with a question you can feel in your bones: “לָמָה יְהוָה תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָחוֹק; תַּעְלִים לְעִתּוֹת בַּצָּרָה?”—“Why, LORD, do You stand far away; why do You hide in times of trouble?” (10:1). The poet doesn’t argue the problem of evil as a philosopher; he narrates it as a person who lives where the wicked hunt the weak.

A quick map of what we’re reading:
- Psalms 9 and 10 are a pair. Many ancient readers saw them as one composition. Together they form a broken acrostic (an acrostic = a poem organized by the alphabet). The pattern starts in Psalm 9 and resumes at ל (lamed) in Psalm 10, with letters missing and out of order. The “broken alphabet” fits the poem’s world: order feels fractured.
- Psalm 10 has three moves: (1) Complaint (v. 1) and a long, vivid profile of the wicked (vv. 2–11); (2) a turn to prayer (vv. 12–15); (3) a bold declaration of God’s kingship and attentive care (vv. 16–18). 

Why this psalm is so gripping:
1) The wicked’s inner monologues. Three times we’re let into what the wicked “says in his heart”—“אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ” (vv. 6, 11, 13). That formula pulls us behind the mask to hear the ideology that powers the abuse. It unfolds like a dark staircase:
   - v. 6: “בַּל־אֶמּוֹט” (“I won’t be shaken”)—raw invulnerability fantasy.
   - v. 11: “שָׁכַח אֵל; הִסְתִּיר פָּנָיו; בַּל־רָאָה לָנֶצַח” (“God has forgotten; He hides His face; He never sees”)—practical atheism.
   - v. 13: “לֹא תִדְרֹשׁ” (“You won’t call to account”)—if God won’t “seek” the crime, there’s no accountability.

That last verb, דָּרַשׁ (darash), is the psalm’s hinge. Darash means “seek,” “inquire,” “call to account.” The wicked counts on “לֹא תִדְרֹשׁ.” The psalmist counters with a prayer that flips the word back: “תִּדְרוֹשׁ רִשְׁעוֹ”—“seek out his wickedness” (v. 15). Language becomes a battleground.

2) Predator imagery you can picture. The wicked is not just “bad”; he’s a hunter. “יֵשֵׁב בְּמַאְרַב חֲצֵרִים; בַּמִּסְתָּרִים יַהֲרֹג נָקִי; עֵינָיו לְחֵלְכָה יִצְפֹּנוּ” (v. 8). He sits in ambush in the village squares, kills from hiding, his eyes stalking the helpless. Then the image layers: “כְּאַרְיֵה בְסֻכּוֹ”—“like a lion in his thicket,” and “בְּמָשְׁכוֹ בְּרִשְׁתּוֹ”—“dragging his net shut” (v. 9). Mixing metaphors (lion and net) here isn’t sloppy; it multiplies threat: brute force and calculated trapping.

3) A theological pivot made of two Hebrew words: “רָאִתָּה… תַּבִּיט” (v. 14). The poet shouts the opposite of v. 11. “You DO see; You DO behold.” Quick grammar refresher: Hebrew “perfect” forms (like רָאִתָּה) typically present completed action. Here that form makes a point: God’s seeing isn’t an optimistic wish; it’s treated as reality. And that changes everything—if God sees, justice isn’t a fantasy.

How the poem argues (without sounding like an argument):
- Spatially: the first line paints God “standing at a distance” (בְּרָחוֹק), and God’s “judgments” as “high” and “far” (מָרוֹם… מִנֶּגְדּוֹ, v. 5). Meanwhile the wicked “sits” (יֵשֵׁב) right in our space (v. 8). The geography of the poem doubles as its theology and psychology: when God feels far, predators feel near.
- Psychologically: the wicked’s theology (“God doesn’t see, doesn’t act”) matches the psalmist’s complaint—but with a crucial twist. The psalmist protests; the wicked exploits. That irony is the psalm’s sharpest point.
- Liturgically: mid-psalm comes a surprising line—“יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ עוֹלָם וָעֶד; אָבְדוּ גוֹיִם מֵאַרְצוֹ” (“The LORD is king forever and ever; the nations have perished from His land,” v. 16). That isn’t analysis; it’s proclamation. A “performative” line (just a fancy way to say speech that does something): by declaring kingship, the community enacts loyalty and hope when evidence is thin. Jewish prayer picks up this line and puts it in the daily “Yehi Khvod” praises, right after “The LORD is King, was King, and will be King.”

Let’s also name the Torah heartbeat here: “לִשְׁפֹּט יָתוֹם וָדָךְ” (“to judge/vindicate the orphan and the crushed,” v. 18). In Torah, God “does justice for the orphan and the widow” (עֹשֶׂה מִשְׁפַּט יָתוֹם וְאַלְמָנָה, Deut 10:18); oppressing them is a red line (Exod 22:21–23). When Psalm 10 ends with “that a man of the earth (‘אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָרֶץ’) no longer terrify,” it draws a contrast: mortal “earthlings” don’t get the last word; the eternal King does.

Key cross-echoes help students see the larger choir:
- Hidden face: compare “אַתָּה תַסְתִּיר פָּנֶיךָ” in our psalm (10:11) with Ps 13:2 “עַד־אָנָה… תַסְתִּיר אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ מִמֶּנִּי” (“How long… will You hide Your face from me?”) and Ps 44:25 “לָמָּה־פָנֶיךָ תַסְתִּיר” (“Why do You hide Your face?”). Same cry, different contexts.
- “He won’t see” bravado: Ps 94:7 quotes the arrogant line almost verbatim: “וַיֹּאמְרוּ לֹא יִרְאֶה־יָּהּ; וְלֹא יָבִין אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב” (“They say, ‘Yah won’t see; the God of Jacob won’t understand’”).
- Nets and self-made traps: Ps 9:16 “בְּרֶשֶׁת־זוּ טָמָנוּ נִלְכְּדָה רַגְלָם” (“In the net they hid, their own foot is caught”) sounds like Psalm 10’s hunter—but turned back on himself.

Why it matters. Psalm 10 teaches a way to pray when God feels far and people get hurt. It neither sugarcoats evil nor surrenders to it. It interrogates the wicked’s “theology,” asks for specific dismantling of predatory power (“שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רָשָׁע,” “Break the arm of the wicked,” v. 15), and—this is crucial—keeps saying “You do see.” The psalm’s last word is not explanation but trust-in-action: God will “prepare their heart” and “incline His ear” (v. 17). That pair is beautiful: God tunes both ends of the prayer line—the human heart that prays and the divine ear that listens.

One last note on the “alphabet thing.” Don’t get hung up on perfect acrostics. What matters is the feel: the psalm lives in a world where even the alphabet—symbol of order—skips a beat. And still, the poem ends with a steady beat: “יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ עוֹלָם וָעֶד.”

  
## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

#### Key verses
- יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ עוֹלָם וָעֶד; אָבְדוּ גוֹיִם מֵאַרְצוֹ (Ps 10:16) — “The LORD is King forever and ever; the nations have perished from His land.”
  - Used in Pesukei DeZimra (Sefardic/Edot HaMizrach) in Yehi Khvod, immediately after: “יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ, יְהוָה מָלַךְ, יְהוָה יִמְלֹךְ לְעוֹלָם וָעֶד.” The service strings them together to proclaim God’s kingship across past, present, and future.

- תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים שָׁמַעְתָּ יְהוָה; תָּכִין לִבָּם; תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ (Ps 10:17) — “The desire of the lowly You have heard, O LORD; You will make their heart firm; You will incline Your ear.”
  - High Holidays (Ashkenazi and Edot HaMizrach): the prayer leader cites this when admitting unworthiness and asking God to ready the congregation’s hearts: “תָּכִין לִבָּם, תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ.”
  - Simchat Torah (Edot HaMizrach, Hakafot): appears in a verse sequence during the first circuit, linking joy with humble dependence: “תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים שָׁמַעְתָּ יְהוָה, תָּכִין לִבָּם תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ.”

- קוּמָה יְהוָה… אַל־תִּשְׁכַּח עֲנָוִים (Ps 10:12) — “Arise, LORD… do not forget the lowly.”
  - Echoed conceptually in selichot; the theme “Don’t forget us” recurs throughout penitential prayers.

#### Phrases
- לָמָה יְהוָה תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָחוֹק (Ps 10:1) — “Why, LORD, do You stand far off?”
  - Sefardic Selichot for the 20th of Sivan: placed among verses of lament about divine hiddenness.
  - Edot HaMizrach (Ne’ilah, Yom Kippur): woven into a piyyut pleading, “Stand in the breach.”

- שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רָשָׁע (Ps 10:15) — “Break the arm of the wicked.”
  - Ashkenazi Yom Kippur Musaf, Seder HaAvodah (after the Temple service description): appears in a piyyut asking God to shatter oppressive power: “שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רֶשַׁע; תִּמְלֹךְ לְבַדֶּךָ…”

What to notice: prayer places v. 16 in the daily kingship chorus, puts v. 17 on the prayer-leader’s lips when hearts need help, and brings v. 15 into Yom Kippur’s bold plea to dismantle injustice. Liturgy reads Psalm 10 as words to live by in hard times.
