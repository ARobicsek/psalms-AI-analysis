# Editorial Assessment (College Edition) - Psalm 10

**What works well:** The draft demonstrates genuine scholarly depth. It correctly identifies the three-fold "says in his heart" formula as structurally significant, recognizes the broken acrostic's theological implications, and grasps the central irony—both psalmist and wicked agree God is hidden but draw opposite conclusions. The verse commentary shows real engagement with Rashi, Ibn Ezra, and Radak. The predator imagery analysis is solid.

**Main weaknesses for a college student audience:**

1. **Too dissertation-like:** The introduction reads like a scholarly monograph. Phrases like "spatial theology," "formal theodicy," "prophetic perfect," and "performative utterance" drop without definition. A first-year student would drown.

2. **Jargon flood:** Terms like "colon," "Leitwort," "Ketiv/Qere," "hiphil," "perfective of conviction" appear constantly without explanation. This violates the fundamental accessibility requirement.

3. **Missing the engaging voice:** Where's the "coolest professor in the department"? The draft is competent but not exciting. No analogies, no "here's what makes this fascinating," no moments of discovery.

4. **Liturgical section cut off:** The liturgical material ends mid-sentence and isn't properly integrated with quotations.

5. **Verse commentaries too long and academic:** Many exceed 500 words and read like encyclopedia entries rather than teaching.

6. **Missed research opportunities:** The Torah Temimah's brilliant connection between "the greedy one blesses" and stolen goods (Bava Kamma 94a) deserves spotlight. The connection to Birkat HaMinim in the Amidah is barely mentioned. The related psalms analysis wasn't utilized at all—Psalm 94's parallel orphan/stranger motif and Psalm 44's hidden-face lament create a powerful intertextual conversation.

7. **Not enough "why":** The draft describes *what* but rarely explains *why* the poet made these choices or why it matters.
