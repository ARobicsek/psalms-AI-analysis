# Editorial Assessment (College Edition) - Psalm 10

What’s strong: The current draft has real strengths. It frames Psalm 10 as a “theodicy” psalm (theodicy = how to talk about God’s justice when evil prospers); it highlights the rare and fascinating triple interior monologue (“אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ”); it notices the wordplay on דרש (darash, “seek/call to account”); and it gives students a good feel for the predator imagery and the rhetorical pivot at “רָאִתָּה” (You do see!). It also integrates traditional commentators, which first-year Hebrew students appreciate.

What needs fixing for college students: 
- A few factual slips (e.g., the intro claims “the absence of the ע stanza,” but Psalm 10:13 begins “עַל־מֶה,” so ayin is not missing). Keep the broader claim—Psalms 9–10 form a broken acrostic—but avoid precise letter claims you can’t support.
- Tone and jargon: terms like “performative utterance,” “speech-act theory,” and “jussive” appear without clear definitions. First-year students need simple definitions on the spot.
- Missed chances to show the Hebrew: when you cite parallels (Ps 13:2; 44:25; 94:7; Job 20:12) and liturgical uses, quote the Hebrew (plus English) so students can see it.
- LXX lines look unreliable/noisy and distract. Unless you have a clear point, skip them.
- The liturgical section needs clear subsections, Hebrew quotes of what’s actually said in prayer, and a short explanation of what these contexts are.

What to add: 
- Use the “Related Psalms” (Ps 94; 44; 7; 74; 31) to show how this psalm’s themes recur; quote at least one Hebrew example per pattern.
- Explain key Hebrew words when they’re interesting (e.g., יִדְלַק, “pursue hotly”).
- Use Torah Temimah’s rabbinic play on “בוֹצֵעַ בֵּרֵךְ נִאֵץ יְהוָה” and on “שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רָשָׁע” in Amidah discussions.

Overall: The argument is good, but tighten claims, define terms immediately, show the Hebrew, and make the liturgical section concrete. Keep the tone lively, direct, and teacherly.
