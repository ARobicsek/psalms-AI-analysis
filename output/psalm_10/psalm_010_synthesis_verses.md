# Verse-by-Verse Commentary: Psalm 10

**Verse 1**

לָמָ֣ה יְ֭הֹוָה תַּעֲמֹ֣ד בְּרָח֑וֹק; תַּ֝עְלִ֗ים לְעִתּ֥וֹת בַּצָּרָֽה׃

"Why, O LORD, do You stand aloof; why do You hide in times of trouble?"

The psalm erupts with a double rhetorical question (לָמָה...לָמָה), a pattern that appears at moments of acute theological crisis throughout the Psalter (cf. Ps 22:2, 44:24-25). The repetition of the interrogative creates an urgent, almost accusatory tone that will pervade the first half of the psalm. What makes this opening particularly striking is its spatial theology: God is depicted as "standing at a distance" (תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָחוֹק) and "hiding" (תַּעְלִים). The verb עָמַד typically connotes presence and stability—God "stands" to judge (Ps 82:1), to help (Ps 109:31)—but here it acquires an ominous passivity through the prepositional phrase בְּרָחוֹק. The psalmist is not complaining that God is absent, but that He is present yet distant, watching from afar like a bystander. 

The second colon intensifies this complaint with תַּעְלִים, from the root עלם (to hide, conceal). This verb often describes divine hiddenness as an act of judgment or withdrawal (cf. Deut 31:17-18: הִסְתַּרְתִּי פָנַי מֵהֶם, "I will hide My face from them"). But here the hiddenness is temporally specific: לְעִתּוֹת בַּצָּרָֽה, "in times of trouble." God hides precisely when He is most needed. The phrase appears verbatim in Psalm 9:10 (עֶזְרָה בַּצָּרוֹת, "help in times of trouble"), suggesting these two psalms function as a theological diptych, with Psalm 9 celebrating God's past interventions and Psalm 10 lamenting His present absence.

Medieval commentators struggled with the theodicy this verse presents. Rashi reads the complaint through Israel's historical experience: God's apparent passivity enables Amalek (identified with the "wicked" throughout) to prosper. Ibn Ezra, characteristically rationalist, suggests that the verse reflects human perception rather than divine reality—God's "distance" is a function of human inability to discern providence. The verb's imperfect tense (תַּעֲמֹד, תַּעְלִים) may indicate continuous or habitual action: "Why do You keep standing aloof?" This grammatical nuance suggests not a one-time abandonment but an ongoing pattern of apparent divine inaction that torments the faithful.

The spatial metaphor here sets up what becomes the psalm's central irony: both the psalmist and the wicked (v. 11) agree that God is hidden. Their responses to this shared perception diverge radically—the wicked exploit divine absence, while the psalmist protests it. This opening verse thus introduces the psalm's core theological problem: how to maintain faith when God appears to be standing aloof, watching from a distance while wickedness flourishes.

**Verse 2**

בְּגַאֲוַ֣ת רָ֭שָׁע יִדְלַ֣ק עָנִ֑י; יִתָּפְשׂ֓וּ ׀ בִּמְזִמּ֖וֹת ז֣וּ חָשָֽׁבוּ׃

"In the arrogance of the wicked, the poor is hotly pursued; may they be caught in the schemes they have devised."

This verse introduces the wicked (רָשָׁע) and his victim (עָנִי) while establishing the psalm's first major theme: the causal relationship between theological arrogance and social violence. The opening phrase בְּגַאֲוַת רָשָׁע functions as an explanatory bet—"because of" or "through the arrogance of the wicked"—making pride the engine of oppression. The noun גַּאֲוָה (arrogance, pride) appears only seven times in Psalms, predominantly in contexts describing the wicked's haughty posture toward both God and humanity (cf. Ps 31:19, 73:6).

The verb יִדְלַק is particularly vivid: from the root דלק (to burn, pursue hotly), it suggests passionate, relentless hunting. Ibn Ezra glosses it correctly as "he pursues" (יִרְדֹּף), citing Genesis 31:36: כִּי דָלַקְתָּ אַחֲרָי, "that you pursued me hotly." The imperfect tense conveys ongoing action—not a single attack but continuous predation. The object of this burning pursuit is עָנִי (the poor, afflicted), the first of five different Hebrew terms for victims in this psalm (עָנִי, חֵלְכָה, נָקִי, יָתוֹם, דָּךְ). This lexical variety prevents the reader from abstracting the oppression into a single category—the wicked prey on the vulnerable in all their forms.

The second colon shifts abruptly to a jussive or passive construction: יִתָּפְשׂוּ בִּמְזִמּוֹת זוּ חָשָׁבוּ, "may they be caught in the schemes which they have devised." This is the psalm's first prayer for retributive justice—let the wicked fall into their own traps. The phrase זוּ חָשָׁבוּ (literally "this they plotted") uses the demonstrative זוּ (an archaic form of זֹאת, "this"), which also appears in Psalm 31:5 and 32:6, suggesting the psalmist is drawing on older poetic diction. The verb חָשַׁב (to think, devise) will recur in verse 4, emphasizing that the wicked's violence is not impulsive but calculated—he "thinks" his way into evil (מְזִמּוֹת, "schemes," from the root זמם, to plot).

Radak notes the psalm's rhetorical strategy here: after describing the wicked's actions, the psalmist interrupts with a curse (יִתָּפְשׂוּ). This creates a pattern of description followed by imprecation that will structure much of the psalm. The traditional commentators debated whether this prayer for the wicked to be "caught" expresses hope for their repentance (they will see the consequences of their schemes and turn) or simple retribution (measure-for-measure justice). The Torah Temimah does not cite this verse, but the principle of middah ke-neged middah (measure for measure) pervades rabbinic thought on divine justice—the appropriate punishment for the schemer is to be ensnared by his own plots (cf. Esther's reversal of Haman's scheme).

**Verse 3**

כִּֽי־הִלֵּ֣ל רָ֭שָׁע עַל־תַּאֲוַ֣ת נַפְשׁ֑וֹ; וּבֹצֵ֥עַ בֵּ֝רֵ֗ךְ נִ֘אֵ֥ץ ׀ יְהֹוָֽה׃

"For the wicked boasts about his soul's desire; and the greedy one blesses himself, scorning the LORD."

This verse provides the כִּי ("for") explanation of why the wicked deserves to be caught in his own schemes: his arrogance extends from social violence (v. 2) to theological rebellion. The opening phrase כִּֽי־הִלֵּ֣ל רָ֭שָׁע עַל־תַּאֲוַ֣ת נַפְשׁ֑וֹ is unusual—the verb הִלֵּל (to praise, boast) typically takes a direct object (one praises *something*), but here it takes the preposition עַל, creating the sense of "boasting *about* his soul's desire." Rashi reads this as the wicked man's self-congratulation: he boasts that he achieves all his desires (כׇּל תַּאֲוַת נַפְשׁוֹ), suggesting his success breeds further arrogance.

The phrase תַּאֲוַת נַפְשׁוֹ (literally "the desire of his soul") is particularly striking. The noun נֶפֶשׁ can mean "throat" (its etymological root) as well as "soul" or "life-force," creating an implied image of appetite—the wicked's soul has a "throat" that constantly desires. This same noun appears in verse 17 where God hears תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים, "the desire of the lowly," creating a deliberate contrast: the wicked boast about their desires; the humble's desires are heard by God.

The second colon introduces one of the psalm's most shocking phrases: וּבֹצֵ֥עַ בֵּ֝רֵ֗ךְ נִ֘אֵ֥ץ ׀ יְהֹוָֽה. The verb בָּצַע means "to cut off, gain by violence," and the participle בֹּצֵעַ thus means "one who gains by extortion," "the greedy one." The problem is בֵּרֵךְ—the piel perfect of ברך, which normally means "blessed, praised." How can the greedy one "bless" while simultaneously scorning (נִאֵץ) the LORD? Rashi resolves this by reading בֵּרֵךְ as sarcastic self-congratulation: the robber "blesses himself," saying שָׁלוֹם יִהְיֶה לִּי, "peace will be mine" (cf. Deut 29:18), even though his actions blaspheme God. Ibn Ezra takes a different approach, arguing that the grasping person "blesses" (congratulates) his fellow extortionists while despising the LORD's ways—violence creates a community of mutual admiration among the wicked.

The verb נִאֵץ (to scorn, blaspheme, revile) with יְהֹוָה as direct object is theologically explosive. It appears only 24 times in Scripture, often in contexts of existential threat to covenant relationship (Num 14:11, 23; 16:30; 2 Sam 12:14). The Torah Temimah cites this verse in the context of the Mishnaic prohibition against blessing over stolen goods (Bava Kamma 94a): Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov teaches that if someone steals a measure of wheat, grinds it, bakes it, and separates the priestly portion, he is not blessing but blaspheming—עַל זֶה נֶאֱמַר: בּוֹצֵעַ בֵּרֵךְ נִאֵץ ה׳, "concerning this it is said, 'the greedy one blesses, scorning the LORD.'" This rabbinic reading captures the verse's paradox: ritual performance (blessing) combined with injustice becomes its own profanation.

The verse thus reveals a theological psychology: the wicked's arrogance is not merely social but metaphysical. He boasts of achieving his desires, celebrates those who share his acquisitiveness, and in doing so implicitly denies divine justice. This is the first step toward the explicit atheism articulated in verse 4.

**Verse 4**

רָשָׁ֗ע כְּגֹ֣בַהּ אַ֭פּוֹ בַּל־יִדְרֹ֑שׁ; אֵ֥ין אֱ֝לֹהִ֗ים כׇּל־מְזִמּוֹתָֽיו׃

"The wicked, according to the height of his nose, does not seek [God]; 'there is no God' [is] all his schemes."

This verse is syntactically challenging, and its interpretation hinges on how one parses כְּגֹבַהּ אַפּוֹ. The phrase literally means "according to the height/loftiness of his nose," with אַף meaning both "nose" and (metonymically) "anger" or "countenance." Ibn Ezra correctly notes that facial height (particularly the nose) is the most visible marker of physical arrogance—when someone is haughty, they literally hold their nose high (גֹּבַהּ אַף). Compare the idiom in Psalm 10:4 with Proverbs 30:13: דּוֹר מָה־רָמוּ עֵינָיו וְעַפְעַפָּיו יִנָּשֵׂאוּ, "a generation—how lofty are its eyes, how raised its eyelids!" The physical posture of arrogance becomes a metonym for the spiritual posture.

The main clause בַּל־יִדְרֹשׁ introduces the key verb דָּרַשׁ (to seek, inquire of, call to account), which will function as a Leitwort throughout verses 4, 13, and 15. Here the wicked's theology is expressed negatively: בַּל־יִדְרֹשׁ, "he does not seek." The object of this seeking is ambiguous—does he not seek God? Or does he not believe God will seek (call to account) him? The ambiguity is likely deliberate, encompassing both the wicked's refusal to seek divine guidance and his confidence that God will not seek his wickedness.

The second colon is one of the most debated in the psalm: אֵין אֱלֹהִים כׇּל־מְזִמּוֹתָֽיו. The standard translation reads this as an interior quotation—the wicked "says in his heart" (implied from v. 6, 11, 13), "There is no God" (אֵין אֱלֹהִים). This reading takes כׇּל־מְזִמּוֹתָֽיו as "all his schemes" in the sense that "God does not exist" is the foundational premise of all his plotting. This interpretation finds strong support in Psalm 14:1 (=53:2): אָמַר נָבָל בְּלִבּוֹ אֵין אֱלֹהִים, "The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'"

However, Ibn Ezra proposes an alternative syntax: אֵין אֱלֹהִים is not a quotation but a statement meaning "God is not in all his schemes"—that is, God has no place in the wicked's calculations. This reading requires taking אֵין as a predicate ("is not") rather than as an existential negation ("does not exist"), and it aligns with Radak's interpretation: כִּי אֵין אֱלֹהִים שֹׁפְטִים בָּאָרֶץ, "for there is no God judging on earth" (i.e., God does not intervene in earthly affairs). This captures the psalm's nuance: the wicked is less a theoretical atheist than a practical one—he lives as if there is no God who will call him to account, even if he grants God's existence in principle.

The phrase בַּל־יִדְרֹשׁ will be ironically reversed in verse 15: תִּדְרוֹשׁ־רִשְׁעוֹ, "seek his wickedness." The wicked's confident assertion that God does not seek is precisely what will be refuted by the psalm's resolution. The Malbim, ever sensitive to lexical precision, suggests that the three-fold repetition of דרש represents a progression in the wicked's denial: first he claims God doesn't investigate (v. 4), then that God doesn't demand account (v. 13), but the psalmist affirms God will indeed seek the wicked's sin until it is found no more (v. 15).

**Verse 5**

יָ֘חִ֤ילוּ דְרָכָ֨ו ׀ בְּכׇל־עֵ֗ת; מָר֣וֹם מִ֭שְׁפָּטֶיךָ מִנֶּגְדּ֑וֹ; כׇּל־צ֝וֹרְרָ֗יו יָפִ֥יחַ בָּהֶֽם׃

"His ways prosper at all times; Your judgments are far removed from him; all his foes he snorts at."

This verse describes the wicked's apparent success through three compact cola that build a portrait of unchecked prosperity. The opening יָחִילוּ דְרָכָו is syntactically odd—the verb חול typically means "to writhe, be in pain" (as in childbirth), but here the context demands a meaning of success or stability. Rashi glosses it correctly: יַצְלִיחוּ, "they prosper," and compares Job 20:21: לֹא־יָחִיל טוּבוֹ, "his prosperity will not endure." This sense of the root חול meaning "to be firm, endure, prosper" (rather than "writhe") appears to be a secondary semantic development, and its use here may be a deliberate irony—the wicked's ways appear stable and enduring, in direct contrast to the trembling and writhing his victims experience.

The phrase בְּכׇל־עֵת ("at all times," "always") emphasizes the continuous nature of this prosperity—not occasional success but persistent, unbroken flourishing. This temporal marker creates a painful contrast with verse 1's לְעִתּוֹת בַּצָּרָה ("in times of trouble")—God hides during the times when help is needed, but the wicked prospers *at all times*.

The second colon introduces the spatial theology that pervades the psalm: מָרוֹם מִשְׁפָּטֶיךָ מִנֶּגְדּוֹ. The adjective מָרוֹם (high, exalted) is used as a predicate here: "Your judgments are high/far removed from before him." The preposition מִנֶּגְדּוֹ (literally "from opposite him") suggests that God's judgments are not merely absent but positively distant—they stand far off where he cannot see them. Ibn Ezra takes מָרוֹם as a vocative (an epithet for God: "O Exalted One"), yielding "O Exalted One, Your judgments are removed from him," but the simpler reading takes מָרוֹם as an adjective describing the inaccessibility of divine justice.

This spatial metaphor recalls verse 1's complaint that God stands בְּרָחוֹק (at a distance). Here the distance is not merely God's position but the position of His מִשְׁפָּטִים (judgments, justice). The wicked experiences God's justice as something that exists on a different plane—high, remote, irrelevant to his affairs. Radak suggests this reflects the wicked's perception: he sees God's judgments as so exalted and remote that they will never descend to touch him.

The final colon depicts the wicked's contemptuous attitude toward his adversaries: כׇּל־צוֹרְרָיו יָפִיחַ בָּהֶם. The verb פוח means to puff, blow, snort, and appears in several contexts of contemptuous dismissal (Ps 12:6; Mal 1:13; Job 31:27). The image is visceral—the wicked literally snorts at his enemies like an animal expressing disdain. Rashi explains בְּהַפָּחַת רוּחַ הוּא מֵפִיחַ בָּהֶם, "with a breath of spirit he blows at them," suggesting effortless dismissal. They collapse at his slightest exhalation. The phrase כׇּל־צוֹרְרָיו creates a comprehensive scope—not some enemies but *all* his foes fall before him.

The verse thus presents a troubling portrait of successful evil: the wicked's ways are stable, God's judgments are remote, and all opposition is easily dismissed. The prosperity of the wicked is not explained or qualified here—it is simply observed as an empirical reality that makes the psalm's opening question (לָמָה) all the more acute. If this is how the world actually works, why does God stand aloof?

**Verse 6**

אָמַ֣ר בְּ֭לִבּוֹ בַּל־אֶמּ֑וֹט; לְדֹ֥ר וָ֝דֹ֗ר אֲשֶׁ֣ר לֹא־בְרָֽע׃

"He says in his heart, 'I shall not be shaken, through all generations I who am not in trouble.'"

This verse introduces the first of three interior monologues using the formula אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ (literally "he said in his heart," vv. 6, 11, 13), a wisdom technique that exposes the wicked's thought-world. The phrase appears throughout Psalms and wisdom literature to reveal inner attitudes that may contradict outward appearances (cf. Ps 14:1, Eccl 2:15). The heart (לֵב) in biblical anthropology is not the seat of emotions but of thought, will, and decision—the mind's inner sanctum where one's true theology resides. What the wicked "says in his heart" is therefore his operating theology, not necessarily what he professes publicly.

The content of his thought is בַּל־אֶמּוֹט: "I shall not be shaken/moved." The verb מוט appears frequently in Psalms in both negative and positive contexts—not being shaken is a sign of divine protection (Ps 16:8, 62:3, 7) or divine establishment (Ps 93:1, 96:10). But in the mouth of the wicked, this confidence is false security, a presumption rather than a trust. The formula בַּל־אֶמּוֹט becomes almost a parody of the righteous person's confidence. Compare Psalm 16:8: שִׁוִּיתִי יְהוָה לְנֶגְדִּי תָמִיד כִּי מִימִינִי בַּל־אֶמּוֹט, "I have set the LORD before me always; He is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken." The righteous person's stability comes from setting God before him; the wicked's stability comes from denying God's active involvement (v. 4).

The temporal expansion לְדֹר וָדֹר ("from generation to generation," "through all generations") makes the wicked's false security even more grandiose. He does not merely claim stability for his lifetime but extends his confidence across generations—an echo of God's own eternal stability (Ps 89:2, 102:13, 106:31). The relative clause אֲשֶׁר לֹא־בְרָע (literally "who/which [am] not in trouble") is syntactically ambiguous. It could mean "for all generations that are not in trouble" (i.e., I will never see trouble), or more likely, "I who am not in trouble [and never will be]." Radak understands it as the wicked's temporal projection: לְדֹר וָדֹר אֲשֶׁר לֹא־בְרָע, "from generation to generation, which [times] I will not see trouble."

The Malbim makes a penetrating observation about this verse in the larger progression of the wicked's monologues. In verse 6, the wicked boasts about his own stability (בַּל־אֶמּוֹט). In verse 11, he extends this to a theological claim about God's forgetfulness (שָׁכַח אֵל). In verse 13, he makes the explicit denial (לֹא תִדְרֹשׁ). This progression from self-confidence through divine absence to explicit denial represents the wicked's intellectual journey from practical atheism to theoretical atheism—from living as if God doesn't matter to asserting that God doesn't act.

The phrase's placement in Jewish liturgy is intriguing. While this specific verse does not appear in the standard liturgy, the contrasting use of בַּל־אֶמּוֹט in Psalms 16 and 21 (both psalms of trust) does appear, creating a liturgical counterpoint to Psalm 10's wicked who makes the same claim but without basis in divine relationship. The daily recitation of Psalm 30:7, which ironically quotes the righteous person's false confidence (וַאֲנִי אָמַרְתִּי בְשַׁלְוִי בַּל־אֶמּוֹט לְעוֹלָם, "I said in my prosperity, 'I shall never be shaken'"), serves as a liturgical warning against precisely the attitude articulated here by the wicked.

**Verse 7**

אָלָ֤ה ׀ פִּ֣יהוּ מָ֭לֵא וּמִרְמ֣וֹת וָתֹ֑ךְ; תַּ֥חַת לְ֝שׁוֹנ֗וֹ עָמָ֥ל וָאָֽוֶן׃

"His mouth is full of oaths, deceits, and oppression; under his tongue are mischief and iniquity."

This verse shifts from the wicked's interior world (his heart, v. 6) to his exterior—specifically, his speech organs. The anatomical focus on mouth (פֶּה) and tongue (לָשׁוֹן) creates a somatic map of evil. The opening phrase אָלָה פִּיהוּ מָלֵא is particularly emphatic. The noun אָלָה can mean "oath" (particularly a covenantal oath invoking curses for violation) or simply "curse." Here, in conjunction with מִרְמוֹת (deceits) and תֹךְ (oppression/fraud), it likely refers to false oaths—the wicked swears by God's name while plotting harm, making his very speech an inversion of covenant language.

The verb מָלֵא (full, filled) appears in the absolute state, functioning predicatively: "his mouth [is] full." Radak notes that מָלֵא functions as a verb here (מְמַלֵּא, "fills"), yielding "he fills his mouth with…" But the syntax as it stands emphasizes the state of fullness rather than the act of filling—his mouth is a container brimming with malice. The three direct objects create a tricolon of speech-based violence: אָלָה (oaths/curses), מִרְמוֹת (deceits), and תֹךְ (oppression). The latter term is rare (appearing elsewhere in Prov 29:13 and possibly Ps 72:14), but cognate to the Aramaic and Syriac roots meaning "to oppress, harm."

The second colon introduces one of Scripture's most vivid anatomical metaphors: תַּחַת לְשׁוֹנוֹ עָמָל וָאָוֶן, "under his tongue [are] mischief and iniquity." The preposition תַּחַת creates a spatial image—the tongue as a landscape with an underside, a hidden space where malice lurks. This image of concealed venom under the tongue recurs in Job 20:12: אִם־יַמְתִּיק בְּפִיו רָעָה יַכְחִידֶנָּה תַּחַת לְשׁוֹנוֹ, "Though evil is sweet in his mouth and he hides it under his tongue." The tongue becomes a weapon that stores its poison until the moment of deployment. Radak glosses: כְּשֶׁיִּשְׁבַּע בַּלְּשׁוֹן, תַּחַת הַלְּשׁוֹן בַּלֵּב יֵשׁ עָמָל וָאָוֶן, "When he swears with the tongue, under the tongue in the heart there is mischief and iniquity"—that is, his outward oath contradicts his inner malice.

The nouns עָמָל and אָוֶן function as a word-pair throughout Scripture, particularly in contexts of violence and injustice. עָמָל denotes "toil, trouble, mischief" (with connotations of wearisome labor turned to harmful purpose), while אָוֶן signifies "iniquity, wickedness, emptiness" (often with cultic overtones—idols are "אָוֶן," worthless things). Together they encompass both the effort and the moral emptiness of the wicked's scheming. The Malbim, characteristically precise in his lexical distinctions, argues that עָמָל refers to evil intentions/plans, while אָוֶן refers to the empty, vain nature of those plans—they are ultimately futile because they oppose divine justice.

This verse presents a striking contrast between public and hidden speech. The mouth is "full" (visible, overflowing), but what it's full of is performative falsehood (oaths, deceits). Meanwhile, under the tongue—hidden, concealed—is the true content: עָמָל וָאָוֶן. The wicked's speech is an inversion of the righteous person's speech described in Psalm 37:30: פִּי־צַדִּיק יֶהְגֶּה חָכְמָה וּלְשׁוֹנוֹ תְּדַבֵּר מִשְׁפָּט, "The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks justice." Here, the wicked's mouth utters oaths (possibly false piety) while his tongue conceals injustice.

The verse functions in the psalm's larger structure as the transition from the wicked's interior life (heart) to his exterior actions (predation). Speech is the bridge—it reveals the hidden (what's under the tongue) even while concealing it (through oaths and deceits). This makes verse 7 the hinge between the wicked's theology (vv. 4-6) and his violence (vv. 8-10).

**Verse 8**

יֵשֵׁ֤ב ׀ בְּמַאְרַ֬ב חֲצֵרִ֗ים; בַּֽ֭מִּסְתָּרִים יַהֲרֹ֣ג נָקִ֑י; עֵ֝ינָ֗יו לְֽחֵלְכָ֥ה יִצְפֹּֽנוּ׃

"He sits in ambush of villages; in secret places he kills the innocent; his eyes spy on the helpless."

This verse inaugurates the psalm's central extended metaphor: the wicked as predator. The opening verb יֵשֵׁב (sits) creates a deliberate spatial counterpoint to verse 1's תַּעֲמֹד (stands). Where God "stands" at a distance, the wicked "sits" in ambush—a posture of patient, calculated waiting. The phrase בְּמַאְרַב חֲצֵרִים is syntactically dense: מַאְרַב (from ארב, "to lie in wait, ambush") denotes the ambush site itself, while חֲצֵרִים (literally "courts" or "settlements") refers to villages or unwalled towns. Rashi identifies these as the outer courtyards or village squares where people gather, making them ideal hunting grounds for a predator who blends into public spaces.

The second colon intensifies the image: בַּמִּסְתָּרִים יַהֲרֹג נָקִי. The plural מִסְתָּרִים (from סתר, "to hide") refers to hiding places, secret spots—creating a paradox with the public spaces of the first colon. The wicked operates both openly (in village squares) and secretly (in hidden places), suggesting his predation saturates all spaces. The verb יַהֲרֹג (he kills) moves beyond exploitation to murder, and its object נָקִי (innocent, clean, blameless) creates a moral absolute—this is not the elimination of a rival but the slaughter of the guiltless. The adjective נָקִי appears only here in Psalm 10, but its resonance with נְקִי דָּם (innocent blood, Deut 19:13) suggests the legal category of murder that cries out for justice.

The final colon introduces the hunter's method: עֵינָיו לְחֵלְכָה יִצְפֹּנוּ, "his eyes spy on the helpless." The verb צָפַן (to hide, treasure up, spy) is particularly apt—it suggests both concealment (hiding one's intentions) and vigilance (watching, spying). The object חֵלְכָה (or חֵלֶךְ) is a rare term, appearing elsewhere as חֶלְכָּה in verses 10 and 14. Its etymology is debated, but it clearly denotes the vulnerable, perhaps from חלה (to be weak, sick) or related to Aramaic חִילָא (strength), meaning "the one without strength." The Masoretic tradition preserves it as חֵלְכָה with a second-person suffix (לְחֵלְכָה, "your helpless one"), which Rashi interprets as addressed to Israel: "To you, Your helpless ones." This vocative reading makes sense of the awkward possessive suffix and creates a direct address to God's vulnerable people.

The image of the watching eyes is particularly chilling. Predators rely on vision to select and track prey. The wicked's eyes are not passive but active, searching (יִצְפֹּנוּ) for targets. This visual predation contrasts sharply with verse 1's divine hiddenness—God has hidden His eyes (תַּעְלִים), while the wicked's eyes are constantly surveilling. The verb צָפַן in the hiphil (to lay up, hide) may also suggest the eyes "storing up" their victims—cataloging the helpless for future violence.

The progression across this verse traces the predator's method: first, he positions himself (יֵשֵׁב) in populated areas; second, he operates from concealment (בַּמִּסְתָּרִים); third, he targets the defenseless (נָקִי, חֵלְכָה). This is not opportunistic violence but systematic hunting. The Malbim notes that the wicked resembles a lion in his calculated approach—he doesn't simply attack but sits, waits, and watches before striking. This will be made explicit in verse 9's simile.

**Verse 9**

יֶאֱרֹ֬ב בַּמִּסְתָּ֨ר ׀ כְּאַרְיֵ֬ה בְסֻכֹּ֗ה; יֶ֭אֱרֹב לַחֲט֣וֹף עָנִ֑י; יַחְטֹ֥ף עָ֝נִ֗י בְּמׇשְׁכ֥וֹ בְרִשְׁתּֽוֹ׃

"He lurks in secret like a lion in his lair; he lurks to snatch the lowly; he snatches the lowly by dragging him in his net."

This verse makes explicit what verse 8 implied: the wicked is a lion. The simile כְּאַרְיֵה בְסֻכֹּה ("like a lion in his lair") draws on Ancient Near Eastern iconography of the lion as apex predator. The noun סֻכָּה typically means "booth, shelter" (as in the festival of Sukkot), but here refers to the lion's thicket or lair—a place of concealment from which to launch attacks. Compare Job 38:40: בְּסֻכָּה יֵשֵׁבוּ ("they crouch in their dens"). The lion in its lair is a standard image of patient, concealed power ready to pounce.

The tricolon structure creates relentless rhythm: יֶאֱרֹב...יֶאֱרֹב...יַחְטֹף. The verb ארב (to lie in wait, ambush) repeats twice, hammering the motif of calculated waiting, before the climactic יַחְטֹף (he seizes, snatches). This verb חטף appears three times in two verses (vv. 9-10), creating an aural assault that mimics the violence being described. The object of this predation is עָנִי (the lowly, poor, afflicted)—the same term from verse 2, but now appearing twice in this verse, emphasizing the targeting of the vulnerable.

The final phrase בְּמׇשְׁכוֹ בְרִשְׁתּוֹ is syntactically complex. The infinitive construct מׇשְׁכוֹ (from משׁך, "to draw, drag") with בְּ means "by his dragging" or "when he drags," and it governs the second בְּ phrase: בְרִשְׁתּוֹ, "with his net." The image suddenly shifts from a lion to a fisherman or hunter using nets—a mixed metaphor that some commentators find awkward but which actually compounds the sense of threat through metaphorical layering. The wicked is both lion (raw predatory power) and net-hunter (calculated trapping). Radak notes that nets were used to trap both animals and humans in ancient warfare, so the metaphor encompasses multiple forms of capture.

The noun רֶשֶׁת (net) appears 22 times in Scripture, often in contexts of entrapment by enemies (Ps 9:16, 25:15, 31:5, 35:7-8). The figurative language database shows that nets function as traps set by the wicked for the righteous across the Psalter. Here the net makes explicit what has been implicit—the wicked's schemes (מְזִמּוֹת, v. 2) are traps, and the lowly are ensnared through a combination of predatory ambush (lion) and methodical capture (net). The dragging motion (מָשַׁךְ) suggests the victim is already caught and being pulled away, unable to escape.

The Malbim's comment on this verse is characteristic of his method. He notes that the psalm begins by likening the wicked to a young lion (כְּפִיר, implied from Job's usage) who goes out hunting openly, but as the wicked "matures," he becomes like the adult lion (אַרְיֵה) who lies in ambush, operating through cunning rather than overt force. This developmental reading may be over-reading the text, but it captures something important: the wicked's violence evolves from hot pursuit (יִדְלַק, v. 2) to cold calculation (יֶאֱרֹב, vv. 8-9).

The verse creates a disturbing portrait: the wicked is simultaneously everywhere (public squares, v. 8) and nowhere (hidden in ambush, v. 9). He operates through both raw power (lion) and technology (nets). And his target is singular and repeated: עָנִי—the one who is already low, already vulnerable, already afflicted. This is not even predation among equals but the strong preying systematically on the weak.

**Verse 10**

יִדְכֶּה יָשֹׁחַ; וְנָפַ֥ל בַּעֲצוּמָ֗יו חֵ֫לֶ֥כאים׃

"He crouches, he bows down; and the helpless fall by his mighty [claws]."

This verse is both phonetically and textu textually problematic, with significant Ketiv/Qere variations that affect interpretation. The Masoretic Ketiv reads וְדָכָה יָשֹׁחַ ("and the crushed one bows down"), while the Qere reads יִדְכֶּה יָשֹׁחַ ("he crouches, he bows down"). The Qere makes better sense in context: the wicked is the subject, continuing the lion imagery from verse 9. The two verbs דכה (to be crushed/to crouch) and שחח (to bow down, be bowed down) both describe a low, crouched posture—the predator lowering his profile before the strike.

The phonetics here deserve attention. According to the transcription, the verse would be pronounced approximately: `yidh-**KEH** yā-**SHŌ**-aḥ wə-nā-**FAL** ba-ʿa-tsū-**MĀY**-w **ḤĒL** kā-**'IY**-m`. The stressed syllables (KEH, SHŌḤ, FAL, MĀY) create a falling rhythm that perhaps mimics the collapsing victims. The sibilant sounds in יָשֹׁחַ (SHŌ) combined with the harsh guttural of נָפַל (FAL) create an aural effect of stealth followed by violence.

The second colon וְנָפַל בַּעֲצוּמָיו is where textual and interpretive difficulties intensify. The verb נָפַל (to fall) is clear, but what falls? And what is בַּעֲצוּמָיו? The Ketiv reads חֵלְכָּאִים (a plural form related to חֵלְכָה, "helpless ones" from v. 8), while the Qere reads חֵל כָּאִים, separating this into two words: חֵל ("company, host") and כָּאִים (participle from כאה, "to be crushed, weak"). If we follow the Qere, the phrase means "the company/host of the crushed ones" or "the afflicted ones." But this still leaves בַּעֲצוּמָיו ambiguous.

The noun עָצוּם (strong, mighty) appears as a plural construct with third masculine singular suffix: בַּעֲצוּמָיו, "by/with his mighty [ones]." This could refer to: (1) his mighty claws or limbs (continuing the lion metaphor); (2) his mighty troops or helpers (suggesting the wicked has accomplices); or (3) his mighty traps/nets (linking to רֶשֶׁת in v. 9). Rashi takes option (2): "To his strong ones the helpless fall"—that is, the victims fall into the hands of the wicked's powerful gang. Radak prefers (3): "He falls by his mighty [traps]"—the victim is brought down by the predator's powerful implements. Ibn Ezra reads it as (1): בַּעֲצוּמָיו = his strong limbs, the tools of his violence.

The ambiguity is perhaps intentional, creating a semantic cloud around the violence—the means of attack remains deliberately vague, emphasizing the victim's helplessness rather than the specific weapon. What's clear is the motion: a downward fall (נָפַל). The victim collapses under the weight of the wicked's "mighty" something. This vertical movement (falling) contrasts with the horizontal dragging (מָשַׁךְ) of verse 9, together creating a complete picture of capture: first the dragging into the net, then the falling/crushing.

The Torah Temimah does not cite this verse, likely due to its textual difficulties and its position within a larger metaphorical unit. But the image of falling by the "mighty [claws]" of the predator resonates with other biblical descriptions of violent oppression, particularly in Amos's social critique (Amos 2:7, 4:1) where the powerful "crush" (רָצַץ) or "trample" (שְׁאַף) the poor. The vocabulary of crushing and collapsing becomes the prophetic language for systemic violence against the vulnerable.

The verse completes the hunt cycle begun in verse 8: ambush (v. 8) → lurking (v. 9a) → snatching (v. 9b) → crushing/collapsing (v. 10). The predator has achieved his goal. The helpless lie fallen. And this brings us to the second interior monologue (v. 11), where the wicked interprets his success theologically.

**Verse 11**

אָמַ֣ר בְּ֭לִבּוֹ שָׁ֣כַֽח אֵ֑ל; הִסְתִּ֥יר פָּ֝נָ֗יו בַּל־רָאָ֥ה לָנֶֽצַח׃

"He says in his heart, 'God has forgotten; He has hidden His face; He will never see.'"

This verse returns to the interior monologue formula (אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ) for the second time, now after the wicked's successful predation. His theological conclusion from his unchecked violence is stated in three parallel clauses, creating a crescendo of divine absence. The first clause, שָׁכַח אֵל ("God has forgotten"), uses the perfect tense to assert an accomplished fact—not "God might forget" or "God seems to forget," but "God *has* forgotten." The verb שכח with God as subject is theologically provocative, appearing primarily in contexts where Israel fears God has forgotten them (Ps 13:2, 42:10, 44:25). But here it's the wicked who claims this, and his claim is not a lament but a celebration—divine forgetfulness means freedom to oppress.

The second clause intensifies: הִסְתִּיר פָּנָיו, "He has hidden His face." This phrase echoes the psalmist's own complaint in verse 1 (תַּעְלִים), creating the psalm's central irony—both the righteous sufferer and the wicked perpetrator agree that God has hidden His face. But where the psalmist protests this hiddenness as unjust, the wicked exploits it as permission. The idiom of "hiding the face" (הסתיר פנים) functions throughout Scripture as the standard expression for divine withdrawal, particularly as covenant curse (Deut 31:17-18; cf. Ps 27:9, 30:8, 69:18, 88:15, 102:3, 143:7). The face (פָּנִים) metonymically represents presence, favor, attention—to hide the face is to withhold relationship.

The third clause provides the temporal scope: בַּל־רָאָ֥ה לָנֶֽצַח, "He will never see" (or "He has not seen forever"). The adverb לָנֶֽצַח can mean "forever, permanently" or "up until now, for a long time." The wicked's theology posits divine seeing as something that doesn't happen across the entire temporal spectrum—God hasn't seen in the past (שָׁכַח), isn't seeing in the present (הִסְתִּיר), and won't see in the future (בַּל־רָאָ֥ה לָנֶֽצַח). This forms a complete theodicy—or rather, an anti-theodicy, a theological justification for why evil succeeds.

The verb ראה (to see) becomes the psalm's key theological term. The wicked claims God doesn't see (v. 11), but the psalmist will assert God *does* see (רָאִתָה, v. 14). The contrast between these perfect tense verbs—לא רָאָה (He has not seen) versus רָאִתָה (You have seen)—structures the psalm's theological argument. Vision equals attention equals justice. If God sees, He must act. The wicked's entire system depends on God's not-seeing; the psalmist's petition depends on God's seeing.

Ibn Ezra makes the interesting observation that this monologue presents divine absence not as a logical inference but as an empirical conclusion: the wicked observes that he has acted with impunity, therefore he concludes God has forgotten. This is practical atheism—theology derived from experience rather than revelation. The Malbim adds that the three clauses represent three different forms of divine knowledge: שָׁכַח (God doesn't remember), הִסְתִּיר (God doesn't see), רָאָה לָנֶֽצַח (God doesn't comprehend fully). The progression moves from memory to sight to eternal comprehension, each clause denying a different aspect of omniscience.

This verse occurs in a particularly striking liturgical context. In the Sefardic Selichot for the 20th of Sivan, verse 1 (לָמָה יהוה תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָחוֹק) is quoted as part of a catena of lament verses questioning divine hiddenness. The liturgy creates a powerful juxtaposition by placing the psalmist's question alongside verses from Psalms 44 and 74, building a tapestry of communal anguish about God's apparent absence. What's theologically significant is that the liturgy takes the wicked's perception (v. 11: God has hidden His face) and transforms it into the community's prayer—the righteous cry out *about* God's hiddenness even as the wicked exploit it. This liturgical usage demonstrates how Jewish tradition read Psalm 10 not as describing an individual wicked person but as addressing the problem of collective suffering under oppression.

The verse stands at the structural center of the psalm's first half (vv. 1-11), bringing the description of wickedness to its theological climax. Everything that follows (vv. 12-18) will work to refute this claim of divine blindness.

**Verse 12**

קוּמָ֤ה יְהֹוָ֗ה אֵ֭ל נְשָׂ֣א יָדֶ֑ךָ; אַל־תִּשְׁכַּ֥ח עֲנָוִֽים׃

"Arise, O LORD! O God, lift up Your hand; do not forget the lowly."

This verse marks the psalm's dramatic pivot from description to petition. The imperative קוּמָה (arise!) is a standard plea for divine intervention, appearing throughout Psalms at moments of crisis (Ps 3:8, 7:7, 9:20, 17:13, 35:2, 44:27, 74:22, 82:8). The verb קום (to arise, stand up) is theologically loaded—it signals the transition from sitting in judgment to standing to act, from passivity to intervention. The call "Arise!" implicitly acknowledges that God has been sitting, resting, or inactive—precisely the complaint of verse 1 (תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָח֑וֹק, "You stand aloof").

The address יְהֹוָה אֵל is striking—the personal covenant name YHWH paired with the generic divine title El. This double divine naming is relatively rare (cf. Ps 85:9, Isa 7:11) and creates an effect of solemn invocation. The shift from the generic "God" (אֱלֹהִים) used in the wicked's monologue (v. 4) to the covenant name YHWH here reasserts the personal, relational character of Israel's God—not an abstract deity who might forget, but the God of Sinai who has bound Himself to His people.

The second imperative נְשָׂא יָדֶךָ (lift up Your hand) employs the idiom of raised hand as gesture of oath-taking or power-display. Throughout Scripture, the raised hand signifies readiness to act (Exod 14:16, Isa 49:22), often specifically to strike in judgment (Isa 11:15, Zech 2:13). Rashi glosses it as showing power: להראות כֹּחֲךָ, "show Your strength." The hand (יָד) represents agency and power—to lift the hand is to prepare to act. This petition directly counters the wicked's success described in verse 5, where God's judgments were "far removed" (מָרוֹם מִשְׁפָּטֶיךָ). If God's justice is far off, let His hand be raised near.

The final clause אַל־תִּשְׁכַּ֥ח עֲנָוִֽים creates explicit verbal linkage to verse 11: the wicked said שָׁכַח אֵל ("God has forgotten"), but the psalmist pleads אַל־תִּשְׁכַּח ("do not forget"). The same verb in contrasting forms—the wicked's confident assertion becomes the psalmist's anxious prohibition. This is the psalm's hinge: will God's remembering prove the wicked wrong?

The object of this remembering is עֲנָוִֽים (the lowly, humble, afflicted). Here there's a textual variant: the Ketiv reads עניים (aniyim, the poor), while the Qere reads עֲנָוִֽים (anavim, the lowly/humble). The distinction is subtle but significant. עָנִי emphasizes socioeconomic poverty and affliction, while עָנָו emphasizes humility and lowliness as moral/spiritual posture. Radak notes both readings and suggests they're essentially synonymous in this context—the poor *are* the humble because oppression has brought them low. The Qere's preference for עֲנָוִֽים may reflect a theological reading that sees the victims not just as economically poor but as the spiritually humble who trust in God despite suffering.

This verse appears prominently in High Holiday liturgy. In both Ashkenazi and Edot HaMizrach traditions, during the chazan's repetition of the Amidah on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, after declaring himself unworthy, the prayer leader invokes this verse: לְחַלּוֹתְךָ שְׁלָחֽוּנִי מַקְהֲלוֹת הֲמוֹנֶֽךָ. תָּכִין לִבָּם תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶֽךָ, "Your teeming congregations have sent me to entreat You. Prepare their heart; incline Your ear" (citing v. 17). While verse 12 itself isn't quoted, verse 17's liturgical use demonstrates how Jewish tradition read these petitions as paradigmatic prayer language for moments when the community feels forgotten. The call to "not forget" (אַל־תִּשְׁכַּח) resonates with the High Holiday theme of divine remembrance (זִכְרוֹנוֹת)—the fear that God might forget Israel in judgment, and the plea for Him to remember His covenant.

The tricolon structure of imperatives (קוּמָה...נְשָׂא...אַל־תִּשְׁכַּח) creates rhetorical urgency through accumulation. Each imperative addresses a different aspect of the problem: קוּמָה counters God's standing aloof (v. 1), נְשָׂא counters God's judgments being far removed (v. 5), and אַל־תִּשְׁכַּח counters the wicked's claim that God has forgotten (v. 11). The verse thus functions as point-by-point rebuttal of the psalm's opening theological crisis.

**Verse 13**

עַל־מֶ֤ה ׀ נִאֵ֖ץ רָשָׁ֥ע ׀ אֱלֹהִ֑ים; אָמַ֥ר בְּ֝לִבּ֗וֹ לֹ֣א תִדְרֹֽשׁ׃

"Why should the wicked man scorn God, thinking You do not call to account?"

This verse introduces the psalm's second rhetorical question (עַל־מֶה, "on what basis?" or "why?"), now not addressed to God (as in v. 1) but posed about the wicked. The interrogative עַל־מֶה appears less frequently than לָמָה but carries similar force—it demands explanation or justification (cf. Jer 8:14, 9:11). Ibn Ezra glosses it as לְשׁוֹן תִּמָּהָא, "language of wonder/amazement," capturing the psalmist's incredulity: *Why* would anyone dare to scorn God?

The verb נִאֵץ (to scorn, despise, blaspheme) reappears from verse 3, where it described the wicked blessing (congratulating) himself while scorning (נִאֵץ) the LORD. Here the scorning is made explicit with אֱלֹהִים as direct object. This verb appears 24 times in Scripture, often at covenant crisis moments (Num 14:11, 23; 16:30; 2 Sam 12:14). To "scorn" God is to treat Him with contempt, to act as if His commands and judgments are negligible. Psalm 74:10, 18 uses the identical verb in similar theodicy contexts: עַד־מָתַי אֱלֹהִים יְחָרֶף צָר יְנָאֵץ אוֹיֵב שִׁמְךָ לָנֶצַח, "How long, O God, shall the foe blaspheme, shall the enemy forever revile Your name?"

The answer to "why?" comes immediately: the third and final interior monologue using אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ. What the wicked "says in his heart" this time is לֹא תִדְרֹֽשׁ, "You do not call to account." The verb דרש, which appeared in verse 4 (בַּל־יִדְרֹשׁ), now recurs with God as subject. This creates a crucial wordplay across three verses: 
- v. 4: בַּל־יִדְרֹשׁ (he does not seek)
- v. 13: לֹא תִדְרֹֽשׁ (You do not call to account)  
- v. 15: תִּדְרוֹשׁ־רִשְׁעוֹ (You will seek his wickedness)

The verb דרש has a semantic range spanning "seek, inquire, investigate, demand account, avenge." The wicked's claim is comprehensive: God doesn't seek out evil, doesn't investigate it, and doesn't demand account for it. This is the logical completion of the practical atheism articulated in verses 4 and 11. If God has forgotten (v. 11), then obviously He won't call to account (v. 13).

The Malbim provides a characteristic lexical analysis, arguing that the three heart-monologues represent a progression in the wicked's denial of divine providence: (1) v. 6—he denies that God will punish him personally (בַּל־אֶמּוֹט); (2) v. 11—he denies that God sees at all (הִסְתִּיר פָּנָיו); (3) v. 13—he denies that God holds anyone accountable (לֹא תִדְרֹֽשׁ). This movement from personal exemption through universal divine blindness to comprehensive divine inaction represents the wicked's intellectual trajectory toward full practical atheism.

Radak notes that this verse (עַל־מֶה נִאֵץ) should be read as the psalmist's question to God: "Why do You allow the wicked to scorn You?" The question isn't merely rhetorical but accusatory—why does God permit this scorn to go unpunished? This reading makes the verse function as another complaint, linking it to the opening lament. The wicked scorns God because he believes (אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ) that God won't do anything about it. And the psalmist's question to God is: Why prove him right? Why allow the scorn to continue?

The verse doesn't cite Torah legislation, but its language resonates with the theological principle throughout Deuteronomy that God "seeks" (דרש) Israel's obedience and "calls to account" (דרש) their rebellion. In Deuteronomy 23:22, the verb appears in a financial context: כִּי־דָרֹשׁ יִדְרְשֶׁנּוּ יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ מֵעִמָּךְ, "The LORD your God will surely require it of you" (regarding vows). The wicked's denial that God "seeks/requires" is thus a denial of basic covenant theology—the belief that God tracks human behavior and demands account.

The verse completes the psalm's first movement (vv. 1-13). We've moved from the opening lament about divine distance (v. 1), through an extended portrait of the wicked's actions and thoughts (vv. 2-11), to direct petition (v. 12) and this climactic question (v. 13). Everything that follows will work to answer this question by demonstrating that God *does* see, *does* remember, and *will* call to account.

**Verse 14**

רָאִ֡תָה כִּי־אַתָּ֤ה ׀ עָ֘מָ֤ל וָכַ֨עַס ׀ תַּבִּיט֮ לָתֵ֢ת בְּיָ֫דֶ֥ךָ; עָ֭לֶיךָ יַעֲזֹ֣ב חֵלֵ֑כָה; יָ֝ת֗וֹם אַתָּ֤ה ׀ הָיִ֬יתָ עוֹזֵֽר׃

"You DO see, for You behold mischief and vexation, to take [it] in hand; upon You the helpless leaves [his burden]; You have been the orphan's helper."

This verse is the psalm's theological hinge, marked by the emphatic fronted perfect verb רָאִתָה ("You have seen" or "You DO see"). The fronting of this verb creates maximum rhetorical force—it places "seeing" at the absolute beginning of the colon, contradicting everything the wicked claimed in verse 11 (בַּל־רָאָ֥ה לָנֶֽצַח, "He will never see"). The shift from the wicked's imperfect/jussive verbs (future or modal) to the psalmist's perfect tense (completed action) is crucial: this is not a hope that God *will* see but an assertion that God *has* seen, *does* see. The perfect tense functions as what grammarians call a "perfective of conviction"—grammatically past but asserting present reality with the force of accomplished fact.

The explanatory כִּי ("for, because") introduces the evidence: אַתָּה עָמָל וָכַעַס תַּבִּיט. The pronoun אַתָּה (You) is technically redundant (the verb רָאִתָה already indicates second person), but its presence creates emphasis: "*You*—You specifically—behold..." The objects of this beholding are עָמָל וָכַעַס (mischief and vexation). These nouns appeared earlier: עָמָל in verse 7 (תַּחַת לְשׁוֹנוֹ עָמָל וָאָוֶן, "under his tongue are mischief and iniquity") as the wicked's hidden malice. Now the psalmist asserts that what the wicked hides under his tongue, God observes openly. The verb תַּבִּיט (from נבט, "to look, regard, behold") intensifies רָאָה—not just seeing but looking *into*, examining, regarding closely.

The purpose clause לָתֵת בְּיָדֶךָ is idiomatically rich. The phrase נָתַן בְּיָד typically means "to give into [someone's] hand," signifying to hand over, to place in one's power, or to take charge of. But whose hand? The suffix is ambiguous—it could be "Your hand" (God takes the mischief in hand to deal with it) or "his hand" (God gives the mischief into the wicked's hand temporarily). Context favors the former: God sees the violence in order to take it into His own hand—that is, to take responsibility for addressing it, to take control of the situation. Rashi glosses: לָתֵת לוֹ גְּמוּלוֹ, "to give him his recompense."

The second colon עָלֶיךָ יַעֲזֹב חֵלֵכָה introduces a new subject: the helpless one (חֵלֵכָה). The verb עזב here doesn't mean "abandon" (its usual sense) but "leave" in the sense of "entrust" or "commit"—the helpless leaves his burden עָלֶיךָ, "upon You." This idiom appears in Psalm 37:5: גּוֹל עַל־יְהוָה דַּרְכֶּךָ, "Commit your way to the LORD." The image is of laying down a burden at someone's feet, entrusting the problem to them. The helpless has no other recourse, no human defender, so he leaves his case with God. Rashi reads this eschatologically: יִשְׂרָאֵל עַמְּךָ שֶׁהֵם חֵילְךָ הֵם עוֹזְבִים עָלֶיךָ אֶת הַמַּשָּׂא, "Your people Israel, who are Your army, they leave upon You the burden [to execute justice on the wicked]."

The final colon introduces the orphan (יָתוֹם) for the first time, though he will reappear in verse 18. The orphan throughout Scripture represents the paradigmatic defenseless person—fatherless, without inherited land rights, without a legal advocate. Torah repeatedly commands protection of the orphan (Exod 22:21-23; Deut 10:18, 14:29, 24:17-21, 27:19). The phrase אַתָּה הָיִיתָ עוֹזֵֽר uses the perfect tense again: "You *have been* helper"—not "You will help" but "You have a track record of helping." This appeals to God's past faithfulness as ground for present intervention. The participle עוֹזֵֽר (helper) appears frequently in Psalms as a divine title (Ps 30:11, 54:6, 118:7), often in contexts where human help has failed.

The verse thus accomplishes a triple rhetorical move: (1) it contradicts the wicked's theology of divine blindness (רָאִתָה versus בַּל־רָאָה); (2) it reframes the helpless's situation from abandonment to trusting entrustment (יַעֲזֹב חֵלֵכָה); and (3) it grounds present petition in past faithfulness (אַתָּה הָיִיתָ עוֹזֵֽר). The shift from complaint to confidence is not based on changed circumstances—the wicked is still oppressing, God's judgments still seem remote—but on a shift in *perception*, in theological assertion. The psalmist chooses to assert God's seeing against all empirical evidence to the contrary. This is the psalm's existential wager.

**Verse 15**

שְׁ֭בֹר זְר֣וֹעַ רָשָׁ֑ע; וָ֝רָ֗ע תִּֽדְרוֹשׁ־רִשְׁע֥וֹ בַל־תִּמְצָֽא׃

"Break the arm of the wicked man; and as for the evil one, seek his wickedness until You find it no more."

This verse returns to imperative petition, now with violent imagery. The opening command שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רָשָׁע (literally "break the arm of the wicked") employs a metaphor of dismantling power. The arm (זְרוֹעַ) throughout Scripture represents strength and the capacity to act (cf. "outstretched arm" as a description of God's power, Exod 6:6; Deut 4:34). To break someone's arm is to remove their ability to harm. The verb שבר (to break, shatter) appears in contexts of military defeat (Jer 48:25: נִשְׁבְּרָה זְרוֹעַ מוֹאָב, "The arm of Moab is broken") and divine judgment (Ezek 30:21-22 describes God breaking Pharaoh's arms).

The phrase isn't unprecedented. In Psalm 37:17, almost identical language appears: זְרוֹעוֹת רְשָׁעִים תִּשָּׁבַרְנָה, "the arms of the wicked will be broken," suggesting this is stock prophetic language for divine judgment disabling the wicked's capacity for violence. Ezekiel 30:21-22 extends the metaphor across two verses, describing God breaking Pharaoh's arm (already fractured) and the strong arm, and scattering Egypt. The image thus has royal-military connotations—breaking the arm of a king is breaking his military might.

What makes the petition morally complex is its violence. The psalmist doesn't ask for the wicked's repentance or conversion but for his violent disabling. This reflects the imprecatory tradition within Psalms, where prayers for the destruction of enemies function as prayers for the end of injustice. The ethical assumption is that the wicked's violence has become so integral to his identity that he cannot be reformed—only dismantled. Medieval commentators struggled with this. Radak suggests the "breaking" could be read metaphorically: שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעוֹ וְתַקְפּוֹ, "break his arm and his strength"—not literal physical maiming but removal of power and influence. The Malbim takes it as political rather than personal: the wicked represents oppressive regimes whose "arm" (military force) must be broken for justice to prevail.

The second colon וָרָע תִּדְרוֹשׁ־רִשְׁעוֹ בַל־תִּמְצָא picks up the verb דרש that has threaded through the psalm. Here's the crucial reversal: the wicked said לֹא תִדְרֹֽשׁ (v. 13, "You do not seek"), but now the psalmist petitions תִּדְרוֹשׁ (imperative: "seek!"). The verb is made emphatic through its direct connection to the noun רִשְׁע ("his wickedness")—seek out, investigate, hold accountable his wickedness. The phrase תִּדְרוֹשׁ רִשְׁעוֹ functions like a legal term: "prosecute his evil," "call his wickedness to account."

The final phrase בַל־תִּמְצָא is syntactically ambiguous. Does it mean "so that You will not find [it]" (purpose clause) or "until You find [it] no more" (result clause)? The traditional reading takes it as result: seek his wickedness thoroughly, exhaustively, until there's none left to find. Radak explains: אִם תִּשְׁבֹּר אֶת זְרוֹעוֹ... לֹא תִמְצָא רָשָׁע בָּאָרֶץ, "If You break his arm... You will not find wickedness in the land." The logic is that breaking the wicked's power (disabling his arm) and thoroughly investigating his crimes (seeking his wickedness) will together result in the elimination of evil—בַל־תִּמְצָא, "You will find none."

The Torah Temimah cites this verse in Brachot 7a and Megillah 17b regarding the structure of the Amidah. The Gemara asks why the blessing against sectarians and informers (Birkat HaMinim) was placed ninth in the Amidah, and answers by citing this verse: כְּנֶגֶד מַפִּיקֵי שְׁעָרִים, "corresponding to those who abuse public authority," and then cites שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רָשָׁע as the scriptural basis for praying against oppressive power. This rabbinic usage demonstrates that the petition wasn't read as personal vengeance but as a prayer for the dismantling of systemic oppression—the "arm" being broken is political power used to harm the vulnerable.

Psalm 10:15 appears in the Ashkenazi Yom Kippur Musaf, specifically in the Seder HaAvodah after the detailed description of the Temple service. Following the narrative of ancient glory, the liturgy shifts to supplication, including this verse in an alphabetical acrostic piyyut: רוּמָה עֻזֶּךָ וְרוֹמֵם שְׁפָלִים; שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רֶשַׁע; תִּמְלֹךְ לְבַדְּךָ בְּקוֹרְאֵי שְׁמֶךָ, "Raise Your might and elevate the lowly; break the arm of the wicked; You alone will reign over those who call Your name." The liturgical usage transforms the verse from individual petition into communal eschatological hope—the day will come when oppressive power is broken and God's kingship alone prevails.

**Verse 16**

יְהֹוָ֣ה מֶ֭לֶךְ עוֹלָ֣ם וָעֶ֑ד; אָבְד֥וּ ג֝וֹיִ֗ם מֵאַרְצֽוֹ׃

"The LORD is King forever and ever; the nations have perished from His land."

This verse erupts as a sudden hymnic declaration, shifting from petition to proclamation. The statement יְהֹוָה מֶלֶךְ (the LORD is King) appears throughout Psalms as a fundamental credal affirmation (Ps 93:1, 96:10, 97:1, 99:1, 146:10). These "enthronement psalms" declare God's cosmic sovereignty, often in contexts of creation and judgment. The formula יְהֹוָה מֶלֶךְ typically introduces a theophanic psalm celebrating God's victorious rule, but here it appears abruptly in the midst of an individual lament, creating a jarring generic rupture.

The phrase עוֹלָם וָעֶד (forever and ever) emphasizes the eternal, unshakeable nature of this kingship. Where the wicked boasted לְדֹר וָדֹר אֲשֶׁר לֹא־בְרָע (v. 6, "through all generations I shall not be in trouble"), claiming his own perpetual stability, the psalmist now asserts God's eternal kingship. The temporal adverbs create a contrast: the wicked's false confidence in his own permanence versus the true permanence of divine rule. The phrase עוֹלָם וָעֶד appears 15 times in Psalms, always in contexts of praise or confidence in God's eternal attributes (Ps 21:5, 45:7, 48:15, 52:10, etc.).

The second colon אָבְדוּ גוֹיִם מֵאַרְצוֹ employs the perfect tense אָבְדוּ ("have perished") in what appears to be a prophetic perfect—grammatically past but referring to a future event viewed as so certain it's described as accomplished. The verb אבד (to perish, be destroyed) is decisive—not "will be defeated" but "will cease to exist." The subject גוֹיִם (nations) is puzzling in context. Earlier verses described an individual wicked person (רָשָׁע). Why suddenly shift to plural "nations"? 

Several interpretations are possible: (1) the wicked individual represents foreign oppressors, so "nations" makes explicit what was implicit; (2) the verse quotes from a separate kingship hymn and has been inserted here for theological effect; (3) "nations" is used idiomatically to mean "the wicked collectively" (as in Ps 9:6, 16, which uses גוֹיִם for enemies); (4) the original context was communal lament against national enemies, and the individual wicked person is the king or leader of these nations.

Rashi reads eschatologically: מֵאַחַר שֶׁיֹּאבְדוּ גוֹיִם מֵאַרְצוֹ, "after the nations perish from His land," suggesting this describes the messianic future when foreign powers will be removed from the land of Israel. This reading connects to texts like Zechariah 14:9: וְהָיָה יְהוָה לְמֶלֶךְ עַל־כָּל־הָאָרֶץ, "And the LORD will be King over all the earth." Ibn Ezra, characteristically rationalist, suggests the verse means simply that when God acts as king, executing justice, then the wicked (called "nations" here) will perish from the earth.

The phrase מֵאַרְצוֹ (from His land) is particularly significant. Is this God's cosmic dominion (the earth as His land) or specifically the land of Israel? The possessive suffix "His land" (ארצו) suggests particular ownership, pointing toward Israel/Zion, but the cosmic context of יְהֹוָה מֶלֶךְ עוֹלָם וָעֶד argues for universal scope. Radak combines both: when God is King, the oppressing nations will perish from the land of Israel, and God's kingship will return to Israel—presumably after exile.

This verse holds a prominent and liturgically strategic position in the Sefardic and Mizrachi rites. It appears in the Pesukei Dezimra (Verses of Praise) of every morning service as part of Yehi Khvod, a curated mosaic of verses celebrating divine majesty. The liturgy places it immediately after the threefold temporal declaration of God's kingship: יְהֹוָה מֶלֶךְ, יְהֹוָה מָלָךְ, יְהֹוָה יִמְלֹךְ לְעֹלָם וָעֶד ("The LORD is King, the LORD was King, the LORD will be King forever and ever"). Our verse follows as the fourth element: יְהֹוָה מֶלֶךְ עוֹלָם וָעֶד אָבְדוּ גוֹיִם מֵאַרְצוֹ, then continues with יְהֹוָה הֵפִיר עֲצַת־גּוֹיִם הֵנִיא מַחְשְׁבוֹת עַמִּים (Ps 33:10), "The LORD foils the counsel of nations." This liturgical placement transforms Psalm 10:16 from a declaration arising from theodicy into a climactic affirmation of God's triumph over earthly powers, structuring the worshipper's consciousness toward divine sovereignty at the beginning of each day.

The genre shift this verse represents is crucial to the psalm's rhetoric. After extensive description of wickedness and earnest petition for divine action, the psalmist doesn't wait for God's answer but declares God's kingship *now*, as if the petition has already been answered. This is what speech-act theorists call a "performative utterance"—the declaration creates the reality it describes. By proclaiming God's kingship in the midst of oppression, the psalmist enacts resistance to the wicked's theology. The wicked said אֵין אֱלֹהִים (v. 4), but the psalmist counters יְהֹוָה מֶלֶךְ. Against empirical evidence, against present suffering, the declaration of divine kingship becomes an act of theological defiance.

**Verse 17**

תַּאֲוַ֬ת עֲנָוִ֣ים שָׁמַ֣עְתָּ יְהֹוָ֑ה; תָּכִ֥ין לִ֝בָּ֗ם תַּקְשִׁ֥יב אׇזְנֶֽךָ׃

"The desire of the lowly You have heard, O LORD; You will establish their heart, You will incline Your ear."

This verse shifts to the language of accomplished confidence, using perfect tense verbs (שָׁמַעְתָּ) and imperfect verbs of assurance (תָּכִין, תַּקְשִׁיב) rather than petition. The opening phrase תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים creates a verbal link back to verse 3, where the wicked boasted עַל־תַּאֲוַת נַפְשׁוֹ (about his soul's desire) and verse 6, where he claimed perpetual security. Now the psalmist asserts that God hears תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים—not the wicked's arrogant desires but the desires of the lowly. The noun תַּאֲוָה denotes "desire, longing, craving"—the same inner yearning, but directed differently. The wicked's תַּאֲוָה is acquisitive and self-serving; the lowly's תַּאֲוָה is for justice, protection, vindication.

The verb שָׁמַעְתָּ (You have heard) is theologically loaded. Throughout Scripture, divine "hearing" (שמע) signals the beginning of redemption. In Exodus 2:24, God "hears" Israel's groaning and remembers His covenant: וַיִּשְׁמַע אֱלֹהִים אֶת־נַאֲקָתָם, "God heard their moaning." The perfect tense here (שָׁמַעְתָּ) functions like רָאִתָה in verse 14—not "You will hear" but "You have heard," asserting an accomplished reality. The act of articulating this psalm *is itself* evidence that God has heard, because the psalmist wouldn't be praying if God didn't listen.

The phrase עֲנָוִים (the lowly, humble) is a Qere/Ketiv variant. The Ketiv reads עניים (aniyim, the poor), while the Qere reads עֲנָוִים (anavim, the lowly/humble). This same textual issue appeared in verse 12. Here, as there, the Qere's preference for עֲנָוִים emphasizes not merely economic poverty but a spiritual posture of humility and dependence on God. Numbers 12:3 famously describes Moses as הָעָנָו מְאֹד מִכֹּל הָאָדָם, "very humble, more than any person on earth," establishing humility as the supreme leadership virtue. The עֲנָוִים are those who, lacking human power, entrust themselves entirely to divine justice—precisely the posture verse 14 described (עָלֶיךָ יַעֲזֹב חֵלֵכָה).

The second colon introduces two future/imperfect verbs describing God's action: תָּכִין לִבָּם (You will establish their heart) and תַּקְשִׁיב אׇזְנֶךָ (You will incline Your ear). The verb כון in the hiphil means "to establish, make firm, prepare." The heart (לֵב) as the seat of will and thought needs divine establishment—the lowly aren't merely heard passively but actively strengthened internally by God's response. Radak glosses: תָּסִיר מִלִּבָּם טִרְדַּת הָעוֹלָם, "You will remove from their hearts the anxiety of the world"—God firms up their inner resolve so they can pray with kavanah (intention/concentration). The image is of God working within the psalmist to enable the very prayer being prayed—a recursivity where prayer itself is God's gift.

The phrase תַּקְשִׁיב אׇזְנֶךָ is a common biblical idiom for attentive listening (cf. Ps 5:2, 17:1, 55:2, 86:6). The hiphil of קשב intensifies the simple "hear"—it means to prick up the ears, to pay close attention, to focus intently. The anthropomorphism of God inclining His ear (like a human leaning closer to hear better) creates intimacy—God bends down to listen to the quiet voice of the afflicted. This contrasts sharply with verse 1's complaint that God stands בְּרָחוֹק (at a distance). Now, though spatially God may be distant, attentively He is near—His ear is inclined.

This verse appears in multiple liturgical contexts, demonstrating its centrality to Jewish prayer theology. Most prominently, the phrase תָּכִין לִבָּם תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ appears in the High Holiday liturgy during the chazan's repetition of the Amidah. Both Ashkenazi and Edot HaMizrach traditions include it as the prayer leader declares his unworthiness: לְחַלּוֹתְךָ שְׁלָחֽוּנִי מַקְהֲלוֹת הֲמוֹנֶֽךָ. תָּכִין לִבָּם תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶֽךָ, "Your teeming congregations have sent me to entreat You. Prepare their heart; incline Your ear." The liturgical shift from first person (their heart) to second person (Your ear) creates a chiasm—the community's hearts need firming, God's ear needs inclining—suggesting that effective prayer requires divine action at both ends. The worshippers can't pray properly without God preparing their hearts, and their prayers can't be heard without God inclining His ear.

The verse also appears in the Edot HaMizrach Simchat Torah Hakafot during the first circuit, associated kabbalistically with the sefirah of Malkhut (Kingship). The liturgy quotes: ...וַאֲנִי כְּזַיִת רַעֲנָן בְּבֵית אֱלֹהִים, בָּטַחְתִּי בְּחֶסֶד אֱלֹהִים עוֹלָם וָעֶד. תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים שָׁמַעְתָּ יְהֹוָה, תָּכִין לִבָּם תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ, "But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in God's mercy forever and ever. The desire of the humble You have heard, O LORD; You prepare their heart, You incline Your ear." This placement links the verse to joyous celebration rather than suffering, demonstrating its liturgical flexibility—it can express confidence in any circumstance.

The shift in verb tenses throughout the verse (perfect שָׁמַעְתָּ, imperfect תָּכִין, תַּקְשִׁיב) creates a timeline of divine action: You *have* heard (past), You *will* establish (future), You *will* incline (future/habitual). This grammatical progression suggests that hearing is the first divine response, followed by strengthening and continued attentive listening—a sequence that models how God responds to prayer.

**Verse 18**

לִשְׁפֹּ֥ט יָת֗וֹם וָ֫דָ֥ךְ; בַּל־יוֹסִ֥יף ע֑וֹד לַעֲרֹ֥ץ אֱ֝נ֗וֹשׁ מִן־הָאָֽרֶץ׃

"To champion the orphan and the downtrodden; that men of the earth tyrannize no more."

This final verse articulates the purpose (לִשְׁפֹּט) of God's attentive hearing: to execute justice for the most vulnerable. The infinitive construct לִשְׁפֹּט (to judge, to vindicate, to champion) takes יָתוֹם וָדָךְ as its object—the orphan and the downtrodden. The orphan (יָתוֹם) appeared once before, in verse 14, where God was declared to have been the orphan's helper (עוֹזֵר). Now the orphan reappears as the primary beneficiary of divine justice. Torah legislation repeatedly commands protection of the orphan, pairing him with the widow and stranger as those lacking familial/communal protection (Exod 22:21-23; Deut 10:18, 14:29, 16:11, 14, 24:17-21, 26:12-13, 27:19). The orphan represents not a random victim but a covenant category—God has bound Himself by law to defend those without human defenders.

The noun דָּךְ (downtrodden, crushed, oppressed) appears only in Psalms (9:10, 10:18, 74:21) and Isaiah (57:15), suggesting poetic vocabulary. It comes from the root דכא (to crush, be crushed), and describes those ground down by oppression—those whose spirits have been broken. The pairing יָתוֹם וָדָךְ creates a hendiadys: the fatherless are ipso facto crushed by their social vulnerability. Together they represent the bottom of the social hierarchy, those with no advocate, no inheritance, no voice in the gates.

The verb שָׁפַט deserves close attention. While English "judge" suggests neutral adjudication, biblical שָׁפַט in contexts involving the powerless means "to vindicate, to champion, to deliver justice *for*" (not merely *to*). The judge (שׁוֹפֵט) isn't a neutral arbiter but an active advocate for the oppressed party. This is clear from Deuteronomy 10:18: עֹשֶׂה מִשְׁפַּט יָתוֹם וְאַלְמָנָה, "He executes justice for the orphan and widow"—not "He judges between the orphan and someone else" but "He secures justice on behalf of the orphan." The psalm ends with this vision: God standing as legal advocate for those who have no other.

The second colon describes the negative purpose—what will cease: בַּל־יוֹסִיף עוֹד לַעֲרֹץ אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָרֶץ. The phrase בַּל־יוֹסִיף עוֹד creates a double negative: "will not continue/add again"—emphatic cessation. What will cease is לַעֲרֹץ (to terrify, to strike terror, to tyrannize). This verb ערץ appears only 5 times in Scripture (Deut 1:29, 7:21, 20:3, 31:6; Isa 8:12, 47:12; Job 13:25), always in contexts of fear before a powerful threat—either military enemies or divine majesty. Here the subject is אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָרֶץ (man from/of the earth), and the meaning is that this "earthly man" will no longer strike terror.

The phrase אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָרֶץ is the psalm's final theological statement, and it's crucial. The noun אֱנוֹשׁ (often translated "man, mortal, human") emphasizes human weakness and mortality in contrast to divine eternality (cf. Ps 8:5, 9:20-21, 90:3, 103:15). When paired with מִן־הָאָרֶץ (from/of the earth), it stresses human earthiness, creaturely limitation, mortality. This stands in deliberate contrast to verse 16's declaration that יְהֹוָה מֶלֶךְ עוֹלָם וָעֶד ("the LORD is King forever and ever"). God is eternal king; man is of the earth, mortal, transient. Ibn Ezra captures this: אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָרֶץ emphasizes that humans are earthborn and will return to earth—they have no inherent right to terrorize others because they themselves are fragile and temporary.

Radak notes that the phrase also implies that the tyrant's power comes *from the earth*—from earthly resources, weapons, alliances—not from heaven. This makes the tyranny doubly outrageous: one mortal terrorizing another mortal, one earthly creature lording it over another earthly creature, when both are dust and to dust will return. The solution is divine intervention: only the eternal King can stop the earthly tyrant.

The verse's purpose clause (לִשְׁפֹּט...בַּל־יוֹסִיף) creates an eschatological vision—not merely "God will judge this particular wicked person" but "God will judge in such a way that tyranny itself ceases." The future envisioned is not return to a prelapsarian Eden but movement toward a world where לַעֲרֹץ אֱנוֹשׁ (the terrorizing of mortals) is structurally impossible because divine justice has become so manifest that no mortal dares tyrannize another. This is why verse 16's kingship declaration stands before this verse—only God's kingship can end human tyranny.

The psalm thus ends not with resolution (the wicked has not yet been destroyed) but with vision. The structure is: (1) lament about present reality (vv. 1-11); (2) petition for divine action (vv. 12-15); (3) declaration of faith despite appearances (v. 16); (4) confidence in God's hearing (v. 17); (5) vision of justice's ultimate triumph (v. 18). The broken acrostic structure—with its missing stanzas—remains broken, suggesting that the alphabet of justice is incomplete in this age. But the psalm asserts that God's kingship guarantees its eventual completion: אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָרֶץ will tyrannize no more.

This ending makes Psalm 10 not merely a complaint or petition but a paradigmatic prayer for all who suffer under oppression. Its refusal to resolve empirically (the wicked still prospers, God still seems distant) combined with its theological assertion (God is King, God hears, tyranny will end) creates a template for living in the tension between present suffering and future hope. The psalm doesn't offer cheap comfort or premature closure. It offers something more valuable: language for truthful protest, theological resources for resisting despair, and a vision of justice that sustains faith even when vindication is delayed.
