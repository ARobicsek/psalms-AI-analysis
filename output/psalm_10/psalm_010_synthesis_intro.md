# Introduction to Psalm 10

Psalm 10 presents readers with an interpretive puzzle that begins with its very structure. The ancient tradition preserved in the Septuagint combined it with Psalm 9 as a single composition, and with good reason: together they form a broken acrostic poem whose letters span both psalms yet leave conspicuous gaps where key stanzas should be. This structural fracture is not accidental. The missing acrostic lines—particularly the absence of a complete ע (*ayin*) stanza in a poem about the עָנִי (*ani*, the afflicted)—enact what the psalm describes: a world where divine order seems incomplete, where the alphabet of justice stutters and fails. If Psalm 9 celebrates God's past victories over nations, Psalm 10 confronts the present crisis of God's apparent absence while wickedness flourishes. The broken acrostic thus becomes a formal theodicy, its very incompleteness mirroring the theological problem it addresses.

The psalm's opening question, "לָמָ֣ה יְ֭הֹוָה תַּעֲמֹ֣ד בְּרָח֑וֹק תַּ֝עְלִ֗ים לְעִתּ֥וֹת בַּצָּרָֽה" ("Why, O LORD, do You stand aloof, heedless in times of trouble?"), establishes a spatial theology that structures the entire composition. God stands "at a distance" (*be-rachoq*); His judgments are "high" (*marom*) and "removed" (*mi-negdo*) from the wicked (v. 5); He has "hidden His face" (*histir panav*, v. 11). Yet this spatial language does not merely describe divine absence—it maps the psychological terrain of abandonment. The verb עָמַד (*amad*, "to stand") typically connotes stability and presence, as in God standing to judge (Ps 82:1) or the priest standing before God (Deut 10:8). Here it acquires an ominous passivity: God stands, but far off, frozen in a posture that suggests both presence and paralysis. This tension between God's seeming inaction and His ultimate sovereignty drives the psalm's theological argument.

The centerpiece of the psalm is not the psalmist's complaint but the unprecedented psychological portrait of the wicked. Through three interior monologues introduced by the formula "אָמַ֣ר בְּלִבּוֹ" ("he says in his heart," vv. 6, 11, 13), the poet exposes the wicked's theological corruption. These quotations reveal a progression of practical atheism: first, the confident assertion "בַּל־אֶמּ֑וֹט לְדֹ֥ר וָ֝דֹ֗ר אֲשֶׁ֣ר לֹֽא־בְרָֽע" ("I shall not be shaken, through all time never be in trouble," v. 6); then the theological conclusion "שָׁ֣כַֽח אֵ֑ל הִסְתִּ֥יר פָּ֝נָ֗יו בַּל־רָאָ֥ה לָנֶֽצַח" ("God has forgotten, He hides His face, He never looks," v. 11); finally, the explicit denial "לֹ֣א תִדְרֹֽשׁ" ("You do not call to account," v. 13). This is the language of theodicy turned inside out: the wicked arrives at the same conclusion as the suffering psalmist—God does not see, does not act—but draws the opposite implication. Where the psalmist protests divine hiddenness, the wicked exploits it. The formula itself, "says in his heart," echoes Psalm 14:1's "אָ֘מַ֤ר נָבָ֣ל בְּלִבּוֹ אֵ֣ין אֱלֹהִ֑ים" ("The benighted man thinks, 'God does not care'"), establishing a typology of practical atheism across the Psalter.

What makes these monologues striking is their accuracy. The wicked's theology of divine absence mirrors precisely the psalm's opening lament. Both the righteous and the wicked agree on the empirical reality—God appears hidden—but their responses diverge radically. The wicked interprets absence as permission; the psalmist interprets it as a theological crisis demanding resolution. This convergence is the psalm's central irony: the very hiddenness that torments the faithful emboldens the wicked. The verb דָּרַשׁ (*darash*) becomes the hinge of this ironic reversal. The wicked declares "בַּל־יִדְרֹ֑שׁ" ("He does not seek," v. 4) and "לֹ֣א תִדְרֹֽשׁ" ("You do not call to account," v. 13), but the psalmist turns this same verb against him: "תִּֽדְרוֹשׁ־רִשְׁע֥וֹ בַל־תִּמְצָֽא" ("seek his wickedness until You find it no more," v. 15). Divine seeking (*derisha*) will ultimately prove the wicked's negation false.

The extended predator imagery (vv. 8-10) translates theological abstraction into visceral threat. The wicked man "יֵשֵׁ֤ב ׀ בְּמַאְרַ֬ב חֲצֵרִ֗ים בַּֽ֭מִּסְתָּרִים יַהֲרֹ֣ג נָקִ֑י" ("sits in ambush of villages, in secret places kills the innocent," v. 8). The verb יֵשֵׁב (*yoshev*, "sits") creates a spatial parallel to God's distant "standing"—where God stands aloof, the wicked sits in ambush. The mixed metaphors that follow—lion in lair (כְּאַרְיֵ֬ה בְסֻכֹּ֗ה, v. 9), hunter with net (בְּמׇשְׁכ֥וֹ בְרִשְׁתּֽוֹ, v. 9)—compound the sense of threat through metaphorical layering rather than precision. This is calculated violence: "עֵ֝ינָ֗יו לְֽחֵלְכָ֥ה יִצְפֹּֽנוּ" ("his eyes spy on the helpless," v. 8). The predator watches, waits, strikes—a pattern that inverts pastoral imagery where God watches over His flock. Here, in God's apparent absence, other predators fill the vacuum.

The psalm's theological resolution arrives not through a change in circumstances but through a shift in perception. The pivotal verse 14 opens with a fronted verb that shatters the wicked's theology: "רָאִ֡תָה כִּי־אַתָּ֤ה ׀ עָ֘מָ֤ל וָכַ֨עַס ׀ תַּבִּיט֮" ("You DO look! For You [behold] mischief and vexation"). The emphatic structure—a perfect tense verb beginning the colon—asserts accomplished reality against the wicked's denials. This is not a plea for future intervention but an affirmation of present vision. God has been looking all along. The shift from imperfect verbs in the lament (תַּעֲמֹד, תַּעְלִים) to perfect verbs in the resolution (רָאִתָה, שָׁמַעְתָּ, v. 17) marks the psalm's rhetorical strategy: the very act of prayer contradicts the claim of divine absence. To petition an absent God is to affirm His presence.

The sudden intrusion of the kingship declaration "יְהֹוָ֣ה מֶ֭לֶךְ עוֹלָ֣ם וָעֶ֑ד אָבְד֥וּ ג֝וֹיִ֗ם מֵאַרְצֽוֹ" ("The LORD is king forever and ever; the nations will perish from His land," v. 16) shifts registers from petition to proclamation. This is not logical argument but liturgical assertion—what speech-act theory would call a "performative utterance" that creates reality through declaration. By speaking God's kingship, the psalmist invokes the cosmic order that the wicked's success had seemed to deny. The perfect verb אָבְדוּ ("have perished") reads as prophetic certainty, collapsing future judgment into present reality through grammatical force. This liturgical strategy—asserting divine kingship in the face of its apparent absence—became central to Jewish prayer, where the phrase appears in the daily *Pesukei Dezimra* of Sefardic rites as part of *Yehi Khvod*, immediately following the threefold declaration of God's reign over past, present, and future: "יְהֹוָה מֶֽלֶךְ, יְהֹוָה מָלָךְ, יְהֹוָה יִמְלֹךְ לְעֹלָם וָעֶד: יְהֹוָה מֶֽלֶךְ עוֹלָם וָעֶד אָבְדוּ גוֹיִם מֵאַרְצוֹ" ("The LORD is King, the LORD was King, the LORD will be King forever and ever; The LORD is King for ever and ever; nations have perished from His land"). By placing our verse as the fourth in this sequence, the liturgy reads Psalm 10:16 as the culmination of the kingship theme, affirming that God's sovereignty proves itself precisely by the elimination of earthly powers that challenged it.

The final plea "לִשְׁפֹּ֥ט יָת֗וֹם וָ֫דָ֥ךְ בַּל־יוֹסִ֥יף ע֑וֹד לַעֲרֹ֥ץ אֱ֝נ֗וֹשׁ מִן־הָאָֽרֶץ" ("to champion the orphan and the downtrodden, that men who are of the earth tyrannize no more," v. 18) returns to Torah's covenant categories. The orphan (יָתוֹם) appears throughout Israel's legal tradition as the paradigmatic vulnerable figure whom God particularly defends (Exod 22:21-23; Deut 10:18). The phrase אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָֽרֶץ ("man from the earth") emphasizes human mortality and earthly limitation in contrast to God's eternal kingship just declared. The verb לַעֲרֹץ ("to terrify") closes the circle: where the opening portrayed a terrorized community before a predatory wicked man, the ending envisions that terror's abolition. The temporal phrase בַּל־יוֹסִ֥יף ע֑וֹד ("no longer," "no more") marks the eschatological horizon—not a return to an idealized past but a movement toward a future where oppression has ceased.

Psalm 10 thus offers not a philosophical resolution to theodicy but a rhetorical one. The psalm does not explain why God appears hidden; it demonstrates that the very possibility of protest, petition, and proclamation contradicts the wicked's claim that God does not see. By moving from spatial complaint through psychological exposure to liturgical assertion, the psalm transforms the question "Why do You stand aloof?" into the affirmation "You are king forever." This is theodicy through doxology—suffering acknowledged, wickedness anatomized, divine sovereignty proclaimed. The broken acrostic, with its missing stanzas, remains broken. But the psalm argues that even incomplete alphabets can spell justice, and even distant kings can hear the cry of the afflicted.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

While Psalm 10 is not recited in its entirety as part of the fixed Jewish liturgy, specific verses and phrases from the psalm have been strategically incorporated into prayer at moments of profound theological significance. Most notably, verse 16's declaration of divine kingship, "יְהֹוָ֣ה מֶ֭לֶךְ עוֹלָ֣ם וָעֶ֑ד אָבְד֥וּ ג֝וֹיִ֗ם מֵאַרְצֽוֹ" ("The LORD is king forever and ever; the nations will perish from His land"), holds a stable position in the *Pesukei Dezimra* of the Sefardic and Mizrachi rites for all Shacharit services. It appears as part of *Yehi Khvod*, a curated collection of verses celebrating divine majesty. The liturgy places it as the climactic fourth element in a sequence that begins with the threefold temporal declaration "יְהֹוָה מֶֽלֶךְ, יְהֹוָה מָלָךְ, יְהֹוָה יִמְלֹךְ לְעֹלָם וָעֶד" ("The LORD is King, the LORD was King, the LORD will be King forever and ever"), then continues with our verse, followed by "יְהֹוָה הֵפִיר עֲצַת־גּוֹיִם הֵנִיא מַחְשְׁבוֹת עַמִּים" ("The LORD foils the counsel of nations"). This strategic placement transforms Psalm 10:16 from a declaration arising from theodicy into a liturgical assertion of God's triumph over earthly powers—reading it not as desperate hope but as accomplished reality.

Individual phrases also appear at moments of intense supplication. The petition "תָּכִין לִבָּם תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ" ("Prepare their heart; incline Your ear," v. 17) appears in High Holiday liturgy during the chazan's repetition of the Amidah in both Ashkenazi and Edot HaMizrach traditions. The prayer leader, feeling unworthy, shifts focus from his own merit to God's power to prepare hearts for prayer: "לְחַלּוֹתְךָ שְׁלָחֽוּנִי מַקְהֲלוֹת הֲמוֹנֶֽךָ. תָּכִין לִבָּם תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶֽךָ" ("Your teeming congregations have sent me to entreat You. Prepare their heart; incline Your ear"). This liturgical usage extracts the verse from its original context of divine vindication and reimagines it as a plea for the inner preparation necessary for genuine prayer. The phrase also appears in the Edot HaMizrach Simchat Torah *Hakafot*, where it is recited during the first circuit, associated kabbalistically with the divine attribute of *Malkhut* (Kingship), embedded in a longer liturgical sequence: "וַאֲנִי כְּזַיִת רַעֲנָן בְּבֵית אֱלֹהִים, בָּטַחְתִּי בְּחֶסֶד אֱלֹהִים עוֹלָם וָעֶד. תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים שָׁמַעְתָּ יְהֹוָה, תָּכִין לִבָּם תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ" ("But I am
