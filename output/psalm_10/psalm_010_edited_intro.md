Psalm 10 opens with an audacious question addressed to God: “Why do You stand far off? Why do You hide in times of trouble?” (לָמָה יְהוָה תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָחוֹק; תַּעְלִים לְעִתּוֹת בַּצָּרָה, v.1). That “far off” and “hide” are spatial words, but the terrain is existential. The poet is mapping the sensation of abandonment: the One who should be near is distant; the face that should be turned toward us is veiled. The psalm proceeds to diagnose what happens when that sense of hiddenness prevails in the world: the wicked become predators, the vulnerable become prey, and theology curdles into cynicism.

Form matters here. From antiquity the Septuagint (the ancient Greek translation) treated Psalms 9 and 10 as one poem. The joint composition is an acrostic—an alphabet poem—that skips letters and falters midstream. The broken alphabet mirrors a broken world. Interpreters have long noticed the irony that the missing stanza for the letter ע (‘ayin) is a poem obsessed with the עָנִי (ani), the “poor/afflicted.” A missing ‘ayin for a psalm about the ‘ani: the poem makes absence felt in its typography.

If Psalm 9 looks backward to God’s public, national victories, Psalm 10 stares into the present: the wicked prospers, and God seems silent. The poet gives us a chilling interior portrait of the wicked that unfolds across three “says in his heart” monologues (אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ): “I shall not be shaken” (בַּל־אֶמּוֹט, v.6); “God has forgotten… He never sees” (v.11); “You do not call to account” (לֹא תִדְרֹשׁ, v.13). This is not doctrinal atheism so much as practical atheism. The inner refrain recalls Psalm 14:1, “The fool says in his heart, ‘There is no God’” (אָ֭מַר נָבָ֣ל בְּלִבּ֑וֹ אֵ֣ין אֱלֹהִ֑ים). Here the wicked reaches the same empirical conclusion the sufferer fears—God’s hidden face—but draws the opposite ethical inference: absence grants permission.

The vocabulary of seeking—דרש—binds the argument. The wicked lives as though “He does not seek” (בַּל־יִדְרֹשׁ, v.4) and taunts God, “You do not call to account” (לֹא תִדְרֹשׁ, v.13). The psalmist answers with a plea that flips the verb: “Seek out his wickedness until You find none” (תִּדְרוֹשׁ רִשְׁעוֹ בַּל־תִּמְצָא, v.15). The Hebrew דרש spans “seek,” “inquire,” “investigate,” and in legal contexts, “require” or “hold to account.” The poem’s hinge is whether God will, in fact, derosh wickedness. Psalm 10 insists: He will.

Between lament and plea comes a long look at the wicked in action. He watches like a hunter and pounces like a lion. “He sits in ambush in the villages… in the secret places he kills the innocent; his eyes spy on the helpless” (יֵשֵׁב בְּמַאְרַב חֲצֵרִים… בַּמִּסְתָּרִים יַהֲרֹג נָקִי; עֵינָיו לְחֵלְכָה יִצְפֹּנוּ, v.8). The “secret places” (מִסְתָּרִים) and the “lair” (סֻכָּה) evoke predation. Parallel texts sharpen the image: “lest, like a lion, he tear my soul” (פֶּן־יִטְרֹף כְּאַרְיֵה נַפְשִׁי, Ps 7:3); “to shoot from hiding at the blameless” (לִירֹת בַּמִּסְתָּרִים תָּם, Ps 64:5). The poet stacks metaphors—a lion and a net (רֶשֶׁת, v.9)—to communicate cunning plus reach. The blending is deliberate: the wicked has both animal ferocity and human technology.

All this is narrated beneath the question of divine attention. The wicked declares, “He hides His face; He will never see” (הִסְתִּיר פָּנָיו; בַּל־רָאָה לָנֶצַח, v.11), echoing Israel’s own dread in crises: “How long will You hide Your face from me?” (עַד־אָנָה תַסְתִּיר אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ, Ps 13:2); “I will hide My face from them” (Deut 31:17–18). Psalm 94 replies with a tart doctrine of created order: “He who planted the ear, shall He not hear? He who formed the eye, shall He not look?” (הֲנֹטַע אֹזֶן הֲלֹא יִשְׁמָע? אִם־יֹצֵר עַיִן הֲלֹא יַבִּיט? Ps 94:9). Psalm 10’s answer is likewise more than theory; it is liturgy: “You do look!” (רָאִיתָה, v.14). The psalmist switches to a perfect verb—a completed action—to assert a reality already in motion. The shift is as rhetorical as it is grammatical (by “perfect,” we simply mean a past/perfective form used here for emphatic certainty).

The psalm’s dramatic turn—“You do look”—is followed by a plea that God disarm evil: “Break the arm of the wicked” (שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רָשָׁע, v.15). In biblical political speech, the “arm” is power; to break it is to dismantle harmful capacity (“The arm of Moab is broken,” נִשְׁבְּרָה זְרוֹעַ מוֹאָב, Jer 48:25; “I will break the arms of Pharaoh,” Ezek 30:21–22). Then comes an abrupt doxology: “YHWH is King forever and ever; the nations have perished from His land” (יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ עוֹלָם וָעֶד; אָבְדוּ גוֹיִם מֵאַרְצוֹ, v.16). The past tense “have perished” functions as prophetic certainty: the future is so sure it can be spoken as done.

The last lines name the vulnerable—“orphan” (יָתוֹם) and “the crushed” (דָּךְ)—and define judgment as advocacy: “to judge [i.e., champion] the orphan and the crushed, so that a mortal of the earth no longer terrorize” (לִשְׁפֹּט יָתוֹם וָדָךְ; בַּל־יוֹסִיף עוֹד לַעֲרֹץ אֱנוֹשׁ מִן הָאָרֶץ, v.18). In the Torah, God “executes justice for the orphan and the widow” (עֹשֶׂה מִשְׁפַּט יָתוֹם וְאַלְמָנָה, Deut 10:18). Here that covenant identity is prayed back to God. The last phrase—“mortal of the earth” (אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָרֶץ)—counterpoints the kingship claim. God’s reign is everlasting; human power is earthbound and brief. The prayer imagines a world where the terror that begins with a crouched predator ends with a humbled mortal and a defended child.

Psalm 10 does not solve theodicy by argument. It resolves it by prayer and proclamation. The poet moves from protest (“Why are You far?”) to perception (“You do look”), and from petition (“Break the arm… seek out his wickedness”) to enthronement (“YHWH is King forever”). The broken acrostic remains broken. But the poem refuses to let brokenness be the last word.

#### Key verses

יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ עוֹלָם וָעֶד; אָבְדוּ גוֹיִם מֵאַרְצוֹ (Psalm 10:16) — “YHWH is King forever and ever; the nations have perished from His land.” In Sefardic (and many Mizrachi) rites, this verse anchors Yehi Kevod in Pesukei Dezimra each morning, immediately after the threefold kingship formula: יְהוָה מָלָךְ, יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ, יְהוָה יִמְלֹךְ לְעוֹלָם וָעֶד (“YHWH has reigned, is King, will reign forever”). Yehi Kevod continues: יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ עוֹלָם וָעֶד; יְהוָה הֵפִיר עֲצַת גּוֹיִם… (“YHWH is King forever and ever; YHWH foils the counsel of nations…”). The sequence turns Psalm 10:16 into a daily confession that divine kingship endures beyond political gains.

תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים שָׁמַעְתָּ יְהוָה; תָּכִין לִבָּם תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ (Psalm 10:17) — “The desire of the humble You have heard, O YHWH; You will steady their heart, You will incline Your ear.” High Holiday piyyutim put these words in the mouth of the shaliach tzibbur (prayer leader): לְחַלּוֹתְךָ שְׁלָחוּנִי מַקְהֲלוֹת הֲמוֹנֶךָ; תָּכִין לִבָּם תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ — “Your teeming congregations sent me to entreat You; prepare their heart; incline Your ear.” The verse thus becomes a plea that God equip worshipers for prayer and bend toward them.

שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רָשָׁע… (Psalm 10:15) — “Break the arm of the wicked…” In the Ashkenazi Yom Kippur Musaf, after the Avodah, a piyyut implores: רוּמָה עֻזֶּךָ וְרוֹמֵם שְׁפָלִים; שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רֶשַׁע; תִּמְלֹךְ לְבַדְּךָ — “Raise Your might and lift the lowly; break the arm of wickedness; You alone reign.” The verse is re-heard as a communal plea for the dismantling of oppressive power.

#### Phrases

לָמָה יְהוָה תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָחוֹק (Psalm 10:1) — “Why, O YHWH, do You stand far off?” Sefardic Selichot for the fast of 20 Sivan weave this cry into a chain of laments: כִּי אַתָּה אֲדֹנָי טוֹב וְסַלָּח… לָמָה יְהוָה תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָחוֹק; לָמָּה פָנֶיךָ תַסְתִּיר (Ps 86:5; 10:1; 44:25). In some Edot HaMizrach communities it appears in Neilah piyyutim on Yom Kippur: עֲמֹד בַפֶּרֶץ… לָמָה יְהוָה תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָחוֹק — “Stand in the breach… why stand far?”

On Simchat Torah in Edot HaMizrach, Psalm 10:17 is recited within the Hakafot as part of a verse-garland: וַאֲנִי כְּזַיִת רַעֲנָן… תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים שָׁמַעְתָּ… — aligning joyous procession with humble dependence.

These reuses are not mere quotations. They interpret the psalm: kingship is confessed daily; helplessness becomes the posture of prayer; the cry of distance becomes the very language of returning.
