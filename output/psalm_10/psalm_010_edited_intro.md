Psalm 10 stands with Psalm 9 in ancient tradition. The Septuagint (the early Greek translation of the Bible) merges them as one poem, and the acrostic begun in Psalm 9 continues across Psalm 10, though with gaps. One conspicuous lacuna is the missing ayin stanza—striking in a poem about the עָנִי, the afflicted—suggesting that even the “alphabet” of order is broken. That formal fracture enacts the theme: the world’s moral sequence feels interrupted; God’s justice seems to skip a line.

The psalm opens with two direct questions: “לָמָה יְהוָה תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָחוֹק; תַּעְלִים לְעִתּוֹת בַּצָּרָה” (“Why, LORD, do you stand far off; why do you hide in times of trouble?” v. 1). The verbs map theology onto space: God “stands” at a distance; He “hides.” The phrase “hide your face” is a biblical idiom for withdrawing favor or presence: “וְהִסְתַּרְתִּי פָנַי מֵהֶם” (“I will hide my face from them,” Deut 31:17). Psalm 10’s opening protests that this withdrawal arrives “in times of trouble,” the very moment when divine sight and nearness are most needed. Theologically, the psalm lives in that dissonance.

What makes Psalm 10 singular is its psychological portrait of the oppressor. Three times we are allowed to overhear what “he says in his heart” (אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ)—that is, what he truly thinks, not what he would say publicly. First: “בַּל־אֶמּוֹט” (“I shall not be moved,” v. 6); then: “שָׁכַח אֵל; הִסְתִּיר פָּנָיו; בַּל־רָאָה לָנֶצַח” (“God has forgotten; He has hidden His face; He will never see,” v. 11); finally: “לֹא תִדְרֹשׁ” (“You do not call to account,” v. 13). The wicked reaches the same empirical conclusion the sufferer fears—God appears hidden—but draws the opposite inference: permission. Where the psalmist petitions, the wicked plunders.

A single verb binds the psalm’s debate: דָּרַשׁ (darash). It can mean to seek, inquire, investigate, or require in the sense of “calling to account.” The wicked, according to v. 4, “does not seek” (בַּל־יִדְרֹשׁ)—either he refuses to seek God, or he presumes God will not seek him. In v. 13 he makes the presumption explicit: “לֹא תִדְרֹשׁ.” But v. 15 turns the verb like a key: “תִּדְרוֹשׁ־רִשְׁעוֹ” (“seek out his wickedness”)—and do so “בַּל־תִּמְצָא,” “until you find none [left].” Elsewhere the Psalter can call God “דֹּרֵשׁ דָּמִים” (“the One who requires blood,” Ps 9:13), and the Torah applies the verb to vows that God will “surely require” (דָּרֹשׁ יִדְרְשֶׁנּוּ, Deut 23:22). Psalm 10 speaks in that register: a demand for divine investigation and requital.

The poem’s middle is a gallery of predation. “He sits in ambush of villages; in secret places he kills the innocent; his eyes watch the helpless” (יֵשֵׁב בְּמַאְרַב חֲצֵרִים; בַּמִּסְתָּרִים יַהֲרֹג נָקִי; עֵינָיו לְחֵלְכָה יִצְפֹּנוּ, v. 8). The language of ambush recurs in the Psalter as a metaphor for hidden attacks (cf. Ps 64:5: “לִירוֹת בַּמִּסְתָּרִים תָּם; פִּתְאֹם יוֹרֻהוּ,” “to shoot in secret at the blameless; suddenly they shoot”). Here, the image doubles: the wicked is a lion—“כְּאַרְיֵה בְּסֻכּוֹ”—and a net-hunter: “יַחְטֹף עָנִי בְּמֹשְׁכוֹ בְּרִשְׁתּוֹ” (v. 9). The metaphors need not be consistent; their stacking is the point. This is violence by patience (ambush), by brute force (lion), and by craft (nets). Psalm 9 had already sketched the justice the psalmist longs for: “בְּרֶשֶׁת־זוּ טָמְנוּ נִלְכְּדָה רַגְלָם” (“In the net they hid, their foot was caught,” Ps 9:16). Psalm 10 asks why that reversal is not happening now.

Between complaint and petition stands one of the Bible’s starkest interior confessions: “He says in his heart, ‘God has forgotten; He has hidden his face; He will never see’” (v. 11). Psalm 13 gives that cry to the righteous: “עַד־אָנָה תַסְתִּיר אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ מִמֶּנִּי” (“How long will you hide your face from me?” Ps 13:2). Psalm 94 taunts those who suppose a blind God: “הֲנֹטַע אֹזֶן, הֲלֹא יִשְׁמָע; אִם־יוֹצֵר עַיִן, הֲלֹא יַבִּיט” (“He who planted the ear, shall He not hear? He who formed the eye, shall He not behold?” Ps 94:9). Psalm 10 gathers all those texts into one polemic: if God truly “does not see,” there is no moral universe.

The turning point is v. 14, where the psalmist answers the wicked’s creed with a sentence that begins, emphatically, with the verb: “רָאִיתָה” (“You have seen” or “You do see”). Grammarians call this use of the perfect tense a rhetorical perfect: a past form used to assert a reality so firm it may be spoken as accomplished fact. It is the psalm’s wager: to pray is already to refuse the wicked’s atheism. The line continues, “כִּי אַתָּה עָמָל וָכַעַס תַּבִּיט, לָתֵת בְּיָדֶךָ” (“for You look upon mischief and vexation, to take it into Your hand”). “To take in hand” means not to permit but to assume control. The helpless, the rare and likely archaic חֵלְכָה, “entrusts” himself to God (עָלֶיךָ יַעֲזֹב חֵלְכָה); and God has been “עוֹזֵר יָתוֹם,” “the orphan’s helper” (v. 14), a phrase that reaches back to the Torah’s covenant identity: “עֹשֶׂה מִשְׁפַּט יָתוֹם וְאַלְמָנָה” (“He executes justice for the orphan and the widow,” Deut 10:18).

Then comes the imperative the poem has prepared: “שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רָשָׁע” (“Break the arm of the wicked,” v. 15). The “arm” is a biblical emblem of power; to break it is to disarm a regime (cf. “נִשְׁבְּרָה זְרוֹעַ מוֹאָב,” “The arm of Moab is broken,” Jer 48:25). The line does not ask for private revenge; it asks for public dismantling of the machinery of harm. The Talmud cites this verse in connection with the structure of the weekday Amidah’s ninth blessing, directed against systemic evildoers (Megillah 17b), and Ashkenazi liturgy places it in Yom Kippur’s Seder HaAvodah, where the community pleads: “שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רֶשַׁע,” “Break the arm of wickedness.”

Suddenly, the psalm pivots to proclamation: “יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ עוֹלָם וָעֶד; אָבְדוּ גוֹיִם מֵאַרְצוֹ” (“The LORD is king forever and ever; nations have perished from His land,” v. 16). The past tense “אָבְדוּ” is a “prophetic perfect”—a future so certain that it is spoken as already done. Why “nations” (גוֹיִם) here? The brief answer is that the psalm peels back a layer: behind the singular “wicked” lurks a larger pattern of predatory power. Medieval exegetes already heard an eschatological chord: the oppressing powers that “perish from His land” make room for God’s manifest kingship (cf. Zech 14:9). Jewish liturgy agrees. In the Sefardic “Yehi Kevod,” this verse follows the threefold temporal acclamation—“יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ… מָלָךְ… יִמְלֹךְ”—as the capstone that assures: God’s rule annuls the boasts of empires.

The end returns to the beginning: “תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים שָׁמַעְתָּ יְהוָה; תָּכִין לִבָּם; תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ” (“The desire of the lowly you have heard, LORD; you will make their hearts firm; you will incline your ear,” v. 17). The past tense “שָׁמַעְתָּ” paired with future “תָּכִין/תַּקְשִׁיב” traces a timeline of attention: God has heard; God will strengthen; God will continue to listen. In liturgy, the prayer leader on the High Holidays borrows this language: “תָּכִין לִבָּם, תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ”—not only “hear us,” but “prepare our hearts to pray.” The poem’s purpose clause is its last line: “לִשְׁפֹּט יָתוֹם וָדָךְ; בַּל־יוֹסִיף עוֹד לַעֲרֹץ אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָרֶץ” (“to judge—vindicate—the orphan and the crushed; that mortal man of the earth will no longer terrorize,” v. 18). The verb “שָׁפַט” here is advocacy, not mere adjudication, as in Deut 10:18. The oppressor is called “אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָרֶץ,” a mortal of the earth—dust after all—opposed to “יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ עוֹלָם.” That is the psalm’s polemic summarized: mortal terror against eternal kingship.

A few terms: “acrostic” refers to a poem whose lines or stanzas begin with successive letters of the alphabet. A “colon” (plural cola) is a single line in a parallel pair. A “jussive” is a verb form expressing wish or command (“may they be caught”). “Perfect” refers to a past verb form, often used in Hebrew to assert completed or sure reality (“You have seen,” “You have heard”). A “prophetic perfect” uses that past form to state what is future as if already accomplished.

Psalm 10 is not a philosophical theodicy. It is a rhetorical one. It moves from complaint to portrait to petition to proclamation, until speech itself becomes a protest against divine absence. The alphabet of justice, as the acrostic reminds us, may be broken; but the psalm insists that its missing letters will be supplied by the One who sees and hears.

#### Key verses

יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ עוֹלָם וָעֶד; אָבְדוּ גוֹיִם מֵאַרְצוֹ (Ps 10:16). “The LORD is king forever and ever; nations have perished from His land.” In Sefardic and Mizraḥi rites this verse anchors Yehi Kevod in Pesukei DeZimra, immediately after the threefold acclamation “יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ; יְהוָה מָלָךְ; יְהוָה יִמְלֹךְ לְעוֹלָם וָעֶד.” The sequence reads: “יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ עוֹלָם וָעֶד; אָבְדוּ גוֹיִם מֵאַרְצוֹ. יְהוָה הֵפִיר עֲצַת גּוֹיִם…” It recasts Psalm 10’s plea as daily praise: God’s sovereignty appears precisely as human schemes fail.

תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים שָׁמַעְתָּ יְהוָה; תָּכִין לִבָּם; תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ (Ps 10:17). “The desire of the lowly You have heard, LORD; You will prepare their heart; You will incline Your ear.” In the High Holiday repetition of the Amidah the ḥazzan pleads: “לְחַלּוֹתְךָ שְׁלָחוּנִי מַקְהֲלוֹת הֲמוֹנֶךָ. תָּכִין לִבָּם, תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ”—“Your multitudes have sent me to supplicate before You. Prepare their hearts; incline Your ear.” The verse becomes a theology of prayer itself: God both receives and prepares prayer.

לָמָה יְהוָה תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָחוֹק; תַּעְלִים לְעִתּוֹת בַּצָּרָה (Ps 10:1). “Why, LORD, do You stand far off; hide Yourself in times of trouble?” Sefardic Selichot for 20 Sivan string this cry with others—“כִּי אַתָּה אֲדֹנָי טוֹב וְסַלָּח…” and “לָמָּה פָנֶיךָ תַסְתִּיר…”—to give communal voice to historical anguish. In the Edot HaMizrach Ne’ilah service of Yom Kippur the line is woven into a piyyut that pleads, “עֲמֹד בַּפֶּרֶץ… לָמָּה יְהוָה תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָחוֹק,” turning the psalm’s question into a last light before the gates close.

שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רָשָׁע (Ps 10:15). “Break the arm of the wicked.” In the Ashkenazi Yom Kippur Musaf, within Seder HaAvodah, a piyyut implores: “רוּמָה עֻזֶּךָ וְרוֹמֵם שְׁפָלִים; שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רֶשַׁע; תִּמְלֹךְ לְבַדְּךָ בְּקוֹרְאֵי שִׁמְךָ”—“Exalt Your might and raise the lowly; break the arm of wickedness; reign alone over those who call Your Name.” The verse is heard as communal, not personal: dismantle systems of harm so Your kingship may be manifest.

#### Phrases

תָּכִין לִבָּם (Ps 10:17). In the Yom Kippur Minḥah Selichot of Edot HaMizrach, a poet prays: “וּמְחֵה הַיּוֹם חוֹבָם… וּלְךָ תָּכִין לִבָּם, וְגַם תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ” (“Erase their debt today… and for You prepare their heart, and also cause Your ear to hear”). The psalm’s description becomes a petition: prepare our interior life so that our prayer may be heard.

תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים שָׁמַעְתָּ (Ps 10:17). In the Sefardic Simḥat Torah Hakafot, the verse is cited alongside Ps 52:10 (“וַאֲנִי כְּזַיִת רַעֲנָן…”) to celebrate divine attentiveness at the moment of Torah’s joyful circuit: praise bound to humility.
