## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (12)

1. What is the significance of Psalm 10's connection to Psalm 9 as part of a broken acrostic, and how does this structural feature relate to the theme of broken/hidden divine order?
2. How does the three-fold 'says in his heart' formula (vv. 6, 11, 13) function in wisdom literature, and what does it reveal about the relationship between ideology and action?
3. What is the semantic range and usage of 'ani (poor/afflicted/lowly) in the Psalter, and how does Psalm 10's usage compare to prophetic social justice texts?
4. How does the predator/lion imagery in vv. 8-10 compare to other Ancient Near Eastern royal or military metaphors, and is there ironic reversal (the powerful acting like beasts)?
5. What is the theological significance of the verb ra'ah (see/look) in vv. 1, 11, 14—how does divine vision function in theodicy?
6. What does 'breaking the arm' (v. 15) signify in biblical political theology, and are there other texts where this metaphor appears?
7. How does the orphan (yatom) motif in vv. 14, 18 connect to Torah legislation (e.g., Exodus 22:22, Deuteronomy 10:18) and covenant identity?
8. What is the function of the nations ('goyim) in v. 16, and how does this relate to the psalm's concern with oppression—are the wicked identified with foreign powers or internal elites?
9. How does the phrase 'men of the earth' ('enosh min-ha'aretz) in v. 18 emphasize human mortality and temporal power versus divine eternality?
10. What is the rhetorical force of the shift from imperfect (future/modal) verbs in the petition section to perfect verbs in vv. 17-18, suggesting accomplished reality?
11. How does this psalm's theodicy—resolving divine hiddenness through assertion of divine kingship—compare to Job's treatment of the same problem?
12. What is the relationship between the wicked's 'prospering ways' (v. 5) and the concept of retributive justice elsewhere in Psalms—is there tension or development?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (15)

1. Why does the phrase אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ ('says in his heart') appear exactly three times (vv.6,11,13), and what is the rhetorical progression across these interior quotations?
2. What is the syntactical relationship in v.4 between 'bal yidrosh' and 'ein elohim kol-mezimmotav' - is the latter a quotation, a description, or syntactically linked to the former?
3. How does the mixed predator imagery (lion in v.9 + net in v.9) function - are these compatible metaphors or deliberately jarring juxtapositions?
4. Why does v.16's kingship declaration use prophetic perfect אָבְדוּ ('nations have perished') - does this assert accomplished fact or prophetic certainty?
5. What is the significance of the five different terms for victims (ani, chelekah, naqi, yatom, dak) - do they represent distinct social categories or poetic variation?
6. How does the spatial theology (God stands afar v.1, judgments are high v.5, but God 'looks' v.14) resolve the theodicy problem?
7. What does the phrase אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָֽרֶץ ('man from/of the earth') in v.18 contribute theologically - is this about mortality, earthly power, or human limitation?
8. Why does the verb דרש appear in three strategic locations (vv.4,13,15) with different subjects and objects - what is the wordplay's function?
9. How does the emphatic fronted verb רָאִתָה in v.14 function grammatically and rhetorically - is this standard Hebrew emphasis or unusual?
10. What is the relationship between the 'mouth full' imagery (v.7) and the 'says in heart' quotations (vv.6,11,13) - interior vs exterior speech?
11. Why does v.10 have Kethiv/Qere variants, and how do these affect the interpretation of who is crushed/crouching?
12. How does the phrase 'breaking the arm' (v.15) function as political metaphor elsewhere in biblical literature - military, juridical, or symbolic disarmament?
13. What is the significance of the sudden genre shift to hymnic declaration in v.16 - does this interrupt the petition or resolve it?
14. Why does the psalmist use both YHWH and El in v.12 - is this poetic variation, theological emphasis, or liturgical formula?
15. How does the orphan motif (vv.14,18) connect to Torah legislation about widow/orphan, and does this invoke covenant obligations?
