**Verse 1**  
לָמָה יְהוָה תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָחוֹק; תַּעְלִים לְעִתּוֹת בַּצָּרָה׃

Two compact questions launch the psalm. The verbs paint space. “תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָחוֹק” (stand at a distance) and “תַּעְלִים” (hide) create a felt map: God seems upright but far, present but concealed—especially “לְעִתּוֹת בַּצָּרָה,” at the very times we most need help. Notice the honesty: biblical prayer does not pretend. It dares to say “Why?” to God. That “why” is classic theodicy (theodicy = how to talk about God’s justice when evil seems to win).

The “hidden face” motif echoes elsewhere. Compare Ps 13:2: “עַד־אָ֫נָה… תַּסְתִּ֖יר אֶת־פָּנֶ֣יךָ מִמֶּֽנִּי” (“How long… will You hide Your face from me?”) and Ps 44:25: “לָֽמָּה־פָנֶ֥יךָ תַסְתִּ֑יר” (“Why do You hide Your face?”). The lament is not faithlessness; it’s faith talking bluntly.

There’s also a subtle contrast that the poem will develop: God “stands” far off (עָמַד can imply stability), but the wicked will “sit” (יֵשֵׁב, v. 8) right in the ambush. The spatial language becomes theology: distance belongs to God, proximity to the predator—until the psalm turns it around (vv. 14–18). If you’ve ever felt like God “ghosted” you (to borrow modern slang), you’re reading the psalm correctly. And you’re not alone; this is a chorus across Psalms 13, 44, 88, and 94.

What the poet won’t do is stop praying. That’s already a counter-argument to the wicked’s later claim (v. 13) that God “doesn’t seek/inquire” (לֹא תִדְרֹשׁ). To pray is to assume Someone hears. The question of the psalm is whether divine “hiddenness” is permanent or apparent. The answer begins to unfold in v. 14 with “רָאִתָּה.”

**Verse 2**  
בְּגַאֲוַת רָשָׁע יִדְלַק עָנִי; יִתָּפְשׂוּ בִּמְזִמּוֹת זוּ חָשָׁבוּ׃

We meet the actors: the רָשָׁע (wicked) and the עָנִי (the poor/afflicted). The verb יִדְלַק (from דלק) is a great Hebrew detail: it means “to burn, to pursue hotly.” So: “In his arrogance the wicked hotly pursues the poor.” The arrogance (גַּאֲוָה) is not a feeling; it’s an engine. It drives hunting.

The second half flips from description to wish: “יִתָּפְשׂוּ… חָשָׁבוּ”—“May they be caught in the schemes they crafted.” That’s the jussive (a Hebrew verb form expressing a wish/soft command). The poet wants poetic justice: let the trap catch the trap-setter. This is a standard biblical reversal (see Ps 7:16: “בּוֹר כָּרָה… וַיִּפֹּל בְּשַׁחַת יִפְעָל” — “He dug a pit… and fell into the pit he made”).

A small but tasty Hebrew point: זוּ is an old demonstrative “this,” used poetically. It gives the line an archaic feel. Bigger point: the psalmist isn’t content just to describe evil. He prays for its collapse under its own weight. That desire for retributive symmetry—evil undone by its own device—will return in v. 15.

—

**Verse 3**  
כִּי־הִלֵּל רָשָׁע עַל־תַּאֲוַת נַפְשׁוֹ; וּבֹצֵעַ בֵּרֵךְ, נִאֵץ יְהוָה׃

This is a theological X-ray. The wicked “boasts” (הִלֵּל) over “the desire of his soul”—his appetite rules. Then the shocking second colon: “the grasping one (בֹּצֵעַ) ‘blesses’—he reviles the LORD.” בֹּצֵעַ comes from בָּצַע, “to gain by violence.” So think “extortionist.” How can he “bless” and “blaspheme” in the same breath? Two ways to read it:
- He “blesses himself” (congratulates himself) while scorning God (Rashi), a cynical self-benign prayer.
- Or he “blesses” fellow extortionists (Ibn Ezra)—a corrupt honor system among predators.

This verse became a rabbinic prooftext for moral nonsense disguised as piety. The Talmud (Bava Kamma 94a) imagines someone who steals wheat, processes it, and then “makes a blessing” on the challah. The classics respond: “אֵין זֶה מְבָרֵךְ אֶלָּא מְנַאֵץ”—“This is not blessing but blaspheming,” and cites our verse: “בוֹצֵעַ בֵּרֵךְ נִאֵץ ה׳.” Great lesson: religious language cannot sanitize injustice.

Also notice the contrast with v. 17: God hears “תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים,” the desire of the humble. Two “desires,” two audiences.

—

**Verse 4**  
רָשָׁע כְּגֹבַהּ אַפּוֹ—בַּל־יִדְרֹשׁ; אֵין אֱלֹהִים—כָּל־מְזִמּוֹתָיו׃

Here’s a compact Hebrew puzzle. “כְּגֹבַהּ אַפּוֹ” literally “according to the height of his nose/anger”—imagine the haughty nose in the air. Then “בַּל־יִדְרֹשׁ”—“he does not seek.” Seek what? Most likely God. But then “אֵין אֱלֹהִים—כָּל־מְזִמּוֹתָיו.” Two readings:
- Quotation: “‘There is no God’—that’s the whole premise of his schemes.” This matches Ps 14:1: “אָמַר נָבָל בְּלִבּוֹ אֵין אֱלֹהִים.”
- Or description: “God is not in all his schemes”—he plans as if God didn’t exist or care (Ibn Ezra, Radak). That’s practical atheism: living as if God won’t call to account.

Either way, the next time we see דרשׁ (darash), it will be on God’s lips (v. 15). The poem is setting up a word-duel: “He says You won’t seek”—so the psalmist asks, “Seek!”

**Verse 5**  
יָחִילוּ דְרָכָיו בְּכָל־עֵת; מָרוֹם מִשְׁפָּטֶיךָ מִנֶּגְדּוֹ; כָּל־צֹרְרָיו יָפִיחַ בָּהֶם׃

Three snapshots of (annoying) success:
- “יָחִילוּ דְרָכָיו”: from a secondary sense of חוּל = be firm/secure; here “his ways prosper/stand firm—always.”
- “מָרוֹם מִשְׁפָּטֶיךָ מִנֶּגְדּוֹ”: “Your judgments are high, out of his sight.” God’s justice is in a different altitude—irrelevant to his calculations.
- “כָּל־צֹרְרָיו יָפִיחַ בָּהֶם”: he “puffs/snorts” at enemies—one contemptuous breath and they scatter (cf. Prov 29:8 “אַנְשֵׁי לָצוֹן יָפִיחוּ קִרְיָה” “scoffers inflame a city”).

This verse names the temptation behind theodicy: prosperity seems to confirm the wicked man’s theology. The psalmist won’t explain it away. He will ask God to end it.

—

**Verse 6**  
אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ, בַּל־אֶמּוֹט; לְדֹר וָדֹר אֲשֶׁר לֹא בְרָע׃

Monologue #1: “I won’t be shaken; for generations I’ll never be in trouble.” It’s the counterfeit of real trust. Compare Ps 16:8 where the righteous says, “שִׁוִּיתִי יְהוָה לְנֶגְדִּי תָמִיד… בַּל־אֶמּוֹט” (“I have set the LORD before me always… I shall not be moved”). Psalm 30:7 even quotes a pious person’s overconfidence: “וַאֲנִי אָמַרְתִּי בְשַׁלְוִי: בַּל־אֶמּוֹט לְעוֹלָם” (“In my prosperity I said: I shall never be moved”). Psalm 10 puts that line in the wrong mouth.

“לְדֹר וָדֹר” (“for generations”) is the scale of his delusion—he claims God’s own timescale.

—

**Verse 7**  
אָלָה פִּיהוּ מָלֵא; וּמִרְמוֹת וָתֹךְ; תַּחַת לְשׁוֹנוֹ עָמָל וָאָוֶן׃

We move from heart to mouth. “אָ֫לָה” can mean “oath” or “curse.” Given the trio (“oaths, deceits, oppression”), think false oaths—pious-sounding speech used to harm. “וָתֹךְ” is rare, a near-synonym of “fraud/oppression.” Then the brilliant image: “תַּחַת לְשׁוֹנוֹ עָמָל וָאָוֶן”—“Under his tongue are mischief and iniquity.” It’s like venom stored for release. Compare Job 20:12: “יִכְחִידֶנָּה תַּחַת לְשׁוֹנוֹ” (“he hides it under his tongue”).

Hebrew detail: “מָלֵא” here functions like “is full”—his mouth brims with words that look like truth but deliver damage. This is the bridge from thought to action: speech.

—

**Verse 8**  
יֵשֵׁב בְּמַאְרַב חֲצֵרִים; בַּמִּסְתָּרִים יַהֲרֹג נָקִי; עֵינָיו לְחֵלְכָה יִצְפֹּנוּ׃

Now the hunt. “He sits” (יֵשֵׁב) in ambush (מַאְרַב) in “חֲצֵרִים” (courtyards/villages)—public spaces. Then “בַּמִּסְתָּרִים” (secret places)—private spaces. He kills “נָקִי” (the innocent). And “his eyes spy on the helpless” (חֵלְכָה, a rare word for the frail/helpless; Masoretic notes preserve a spelling that can be heard as “your helpless one,” which Rashi reads as Israel: “Your helpless ones”).

The noun pair “מַאְרַב/מִסְתָּרִים” names two modes of predation: open and hidden. The verbs stay simple and concrete: sit, kill, watch. What God “hides” (v. 1; 11), the wicked exposes: he carefully “watches” his victims.

—

**Verse 9**  
יֶאֱרֹב בַּמִּסְתָּר, כְּאַרְיֵה בְסֻכּוֹ; יֶאֱרֹב לַחֲטֹף עָנִי; יַחְטֹף עָנִי, בְּמָשְׁכוֹ בְּרִשְׁתּוֹ׃

The lion metaphor arrives: “like a lion in his thicket” (בְּסֻכּוֹ). “יַחְטֹף” (to snatch) repeats—the rhythm imitates pounce. Then the switch to technology: a net (רֶשֶׁת) being drawn tight. Mixed metaphors? Absolutely—and effectively. The wicked is both apex predator and cunning trapper.

Elsewhere the lion-hunter imagery targets God’s people too (Ps 17:12: “כְּאַרְיֵה יִכְסֹף לִטְרֹף”). And nets often snap back on the wicked (Ps 9:16; 25:15). Students should mark this: Psalms consistently imagine evil as entrapment—and divine justice as reversal.

—

**Verse 10**  
יִדְכֶּה יָשֹׁחַ; וְנָפַל בַּעֲצוּמָיו חֵל כָּאִים׃  [Ketiv/Qere variants: וְדָכָה/יִדְכֶּה; חֵלְכָּאִים/חֵל כָּאִים]

Textual note first (because it matters for sense): Ketiv (what’s written) vs Qere (what’s read) diverge here. Qere reads “יִדְכֶּה יָשֹׁחַ” (“he crouches, he bows”)—keeping the wicked as subject. Ketiv can be heard as “and the crushed [one] bows”—shifting subject to the victim. Either way, the image is low posture before the strike.

“וְנָפַל בַּעֲצוּמָיו” is ambiguous: “falls by his mighty [strength/limbs/men].” “חֵל כָּאִים” (Qere) = “a company of the crushed,” or “the strength of the crushed,” or (Ketiv) “חֵלְכָּאִים” = “helpless ones.” The haze may be intentional: the point is collapse under force. If you imagine a lion’s weight pressing prey into dust, you are in the scene.

—

**Verse 11**  
אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ: שָׁכַח אֵל; הִסְתִּיר פָּנָיו; בַּל־רָאָה לָנֶצַח׃

Monologue #2, the triple denial. Past (“has forgotten”), present (“has hidden His face”), and always (“never sees”). This mirrors v. 1’s complaint—but with opposite intent. The wicked uses “hiddenness” as a permission slip.

Compare Ps 94:7, a near-quote: “וַיֹּאמְרוּ לֹא יִרְאֶה־יָּהּ; וְלֹא־יָבִין אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב” (“They say, ‘Yah won’t see; the God of Jacob won’t understand’”). Also Deut 31:17: God warns that in covenant breach, “וְהִסְתַּרְתִּי פָנַי מֵהֶם” (“I will hide My face from them”). Psalm 10 lives in that tension—hiddenness is part of the covenant script, but it is not the end.

The psalmist will now argue back—not with philosophy but with “רָאִתָּה” (You do see).

—

**Verse 12**  
קוּמָה יְהוָה! אֵל, נְשָׂא יָדֶךָ; אַל־תִּשְׁכַּח עֲנָוִים׃

The pivot to petition. “קוּמָה” (Arise!) is a stock biblical cry when God’s help is needed (Ps 3:8; 7:7; 74:22). “נְשָׂא יָדֶךָ” (lift Your hand) is a vivid idiom: show Your power; strike if needed. And the wicked’s claim “שָׁכַח אֵל” gets flipped into prayer: “אַל־תִּשְׁכַּח”—“don’t forget” the lowly. (Qere reads עֲנָוִים, “humble”; Ketiv has עֲנִיִּים, “poor”—either way, the vulnerable.)

Liturgically, this language saturates selichot (penitential prayers). It’s the grammar of need: “Arise… don’t forget.”

—

**Verse 13**  
עַל־מֶה נִאֵץ רָשָׁע אֱלֹהִים? אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ: לֹא תִדְרֹשׁ׃

Question #2: “On what basis does the wicked scorn God?” Answer: his creed—“You won’t seek/call to account.” This is the third “אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ.” The word דרשׁ (darash) returns centrally. We met it negatively in v. 4 (“doesn’t seek”); now positively, the psalmist will ask God to do exactly what the wicked denies (v. 15).

Note the verb נִאֵץ (to scorn/blaspheme). It’s used for serious covenant violations (e.g., 2 Sam 12:14). Psalm 10 is not a “minor infractions” psalm; it calls predation what it is: an act against God.

—

**Verse 14**  
רָאִתָּה: כִּי־אַתָּה עָמָל וָכַעַס תַּבִּיט; לָתֵת בְּיָדֶךָ. עָלֶיךָ יַעֲזֹב חֵלְכָה; יָתוֹם אַתָּה הָיִיתָ עֹזֵר׃

The theological hinge. “רָאִתָּה” (perfect form) fronts the line: “You have seen/You DO see.” This contradicts v. 11’s “He never sees.” “תַּבִּיט” (you behold) intensifies “see”—it suggests careful, engaged looking. What does God see? “עָמָל וָכַעַס”—mischief/oppression and provocation/anger.

“לָתֵת בְּיָדֶךָ” probably means “to take [the matter] into Your hand,” i.e., assume control and repay. Then a tender relational line: “עָלֶיךָ יַעֲזֹב חֵלְכָה”—“Upon You the helpless leaves [it].” Here עָזַב = “entrust,” like laying a burden down (cf. Ps 37:5 “גול על יהוה דרכך”—“Commit your way to the LORD”). “You have been the orphan’s helper” appeals to God’s track record.

Torah background throbs under this: “עֹשֶׂה מִשְׁפַּט יָתוֹם וְאַלְמָנָה” (Deut 10:18); “If you afflict them and they cry, I will hear” (Exod 22:21–23). Psalm 10 says: You’ve always been that God. Be that now.

—

**Verse 15**  
שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רָשָׁע; וָרָע—תִּדְרוֹשׁ רִשְׁעוֹ בַּל־תִּמְצָא׃

Concrete request: “Break the arm of the wicked.” The “arm” is a biblical symbol for power (cf. God’s “outstretched arm” in Exodus). To break it = disable the capacity to harm. Then the wordplay payoff: “תִּדְרוֹשׁ רִשְׁעוֹ”—“seek/prosecute his wickedness”—“בַּל־תִּמְצָא.” Many read that last bit as “until You find [none],” i.e., seek it down to zero—eliminate it.

This verse shaped Jewish liturgy’s structure. The Talmud (Megillah 17b) links the Amidah’s blessing against evil-doers to texts like this—the community asks God to dismantle predatory power. On Yom Kippur in Ashkenazi Seder HaAvodah, you’ll hear: “שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רֶשַׁע; תִּמְלֹךְ לְבַדֶּךָ…”—“Break the arm of wickedness; You alone reign…”

Ethically important note: the psalm prays not (here) for personal revenge but for structural disabling of harm. Break the “arm,” not the image-bearer.

—

**Verse 16**  
יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ עוֹלָם וָעֶד; אָבְדוּ גוֹיִם מֵאַרְצוֹ׃

Sudden hymnic proclamation: “The LORD is King forever and ever.” Then a “prophetic perfect” (“אָבְדוּ”—past form used to express certain future): “the nations have perished from His land.” Students sometimes ask: who are these “nations” if we’ve been talking about a single wicked person? Likely the wicked here represent oppressive powers generally; the declaration widens the lens. 

Liturgy loves this line. In Yehi Khvod (Sefardic/Mizrachi), it sits right after “The LORD is King/was King/will be King,” making v. 16 the banner that follows the time-triple.

Spiritually, it’s the line you sing when evidence is thin. It’s not denial; it’s defiance against despair.

—

**Verse 17**  
תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים שָׁמַעְתָּ יְהוָה; תָּכִין לִבָּם; תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ׃

Confidence now breathes. “You have heard” (perfect form again) the “desire” (תַּאֲוָה) of the humble. Note the contrast with v. 3’s “desire” of the wicked. Two lovely requests: “תָּכִין לִבָּם” (establish/prepare their heart) and “תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ” (incline Your ear). God readies the pray-er and leans in to hear.

This verse appears in High Holiday liturgy as the shaliach tzibbur (prayer leader) asks God to prepare the congregation’s heart. It’s a gorgeous theological claim: genuine prayer is God’s work in us as much as ours toward God.

—

**Verse 18**  
לִשְׁפֹּט יָתוֹם וָדָךְ; בַּל־יוֹסִיף עוֹד לַעֲרֹץ אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָרֶץ׃

The goal: to “judge” (here = vindicate/champion) the orphan and the crushed (דָּךְ). And the outcome: “that man of the earth” (אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָרֶץ—emphasis on mortality) will no longer terrify (לַעֲרֹץ). Two final contrasts sit here:
- God’s eternal kingship (v. 16) vs. man of the earth (v. 18). One is forever; the other is dust.
- The reign of terror (vv. 8–10) vs. the end of terror (“בַּל־יוֹסִיף עוֹד”—“no more”).

Deuteronomy keeps ringing: God’s passion for the orphan/widow/stranger is an identity marker. Psalm 10 ends by asking God to make that identity visible in public justice—so that tyrants, even dressed in religious language, won’t scare anyone again.

  
This psalm doesn’t explain suffering; it teaches us how to speak in it. The triple “he says in his heart” meets the community’s triple reply: “Arise,” “You do see,” “The LORD is King.” And the last sound we hear? God inclining His ear.
