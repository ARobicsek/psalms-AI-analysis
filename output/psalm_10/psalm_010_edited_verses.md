**Verse 1**

לָמָה יְהוָה תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָחוֹק; תַּעְלִים לְעִתּוֹת בַּצָּרָה׃

The psalm begins with two interrogatives, both “לָמָה,” “why,” and sets the spatial theology that will govern the poem. God “stands” (עָמַד) “far off” and “hides” (עלם) precisely “in times of trouble.” Standing, elsewhere, can denote presence and readiness (cf. Ps 82:1, the divine “standing” in the council), but here the prepositional “בְּרָחוֹק” reverses the expectation: present but distant; observing, not intervening. The idiom “to hide the face” (הסתר פנים) is the stock biblical image for divine withdrawal (Deut 31:17; Ps 13:2: “עַד־אָנָה… תַסְתִּיר אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ מִמֶּנִּי,” “How long… will You hide Your face from me?”). The complaint is thus not atheistic but covenantal: it presumes a God who once acted and is expected to act again.

Rashi construes the line as a protest against a pattern—God’s “eyes” seemingly averted at the hour of affliction—while Ibn Ezra notes that God’s “distance” is a human perception conditioned by the absence of visible power. The verbs in Hebrew are imperfects—forms that often express ongoing or repeated action—so the question is not “Why did You…?” but “Why do You keep…?” The psalm’s drama will turn on whether that perception is true (as the wicked supposes) or intolerable (as the petition insists).

The line’s compactness—a hallmark of biblical verse—omits conjunctions and logical links, forcing the reader to infer the relationship between cola. The two parts of the line intensify each other (“A is so—and what’s more, B”): distance (“stand far”) culminates in concealment (“hide”). The psalm will later invert both: God’s “hand” is lifted (v. 12), and God “does see” (v. 14). In other words, the opening complaint sets up the poem’s rebuttal, but that rebuttal emerges not from observation but from the act of prayer itself.

Finally, note how Psalm 10 converses with its neighbors. Psalm 44, a communal lament, uses nearly identical language: “לָמָּה־פָנֶיךָ תַסְתִּיר; תִּשְׁכַּח עָנְיֵנוּ וְלַחֲצֵנוּ” (“Why do You hide Your face? Will You forget our affliction and oppression?” Ps 44:25). The same idiom can be prayed by a nation or an individual—which is precisely Psalm 10’s point: the oppressor’s success feels like systemic failure of justice.

**Verse 2**

בְּגַאֲוַת רָשָׁע יִדְלַק עָנִי; יִתָּפְשׂוּ בִּמְזִמּוֹת זוּ חָשָׁבוּ׃

The verse moves from diagnosis to imprecation. The prefixed bet in “בְּגַאֲוַת רָשָׁע” is causal (“because of/by the arrogance of the wicked”). The verb “יִדְלַק” (dālaq) literally means “burn” but idiomatically “hotly pursue” (Gen 31:36: “כִּי דָלַקְתָּ אַחֲרָי,” “that you pursued me hotly”). The object is “עָנִי,” the afflicted poor—the first of a cluster of terms for the vulnerable in this psalm (עָנִי, חֵלְכָה, נָקִי, יָתוֹם, דָּךְ). The second colon shifts into a jussive (a wish/command form): “יִתָּפְשׂוּ” (“may they be caught”) “בִּמְזִמּוֹת זוּ חָשָׁבוּ” (“in the schemes they themselves devised”). The demonstrative זוּ (“this,” an older poetic form) adds bite: “that very thing they plotted.”

The justice envisioned is measure-for-measure (middah k’neged middah). Psalm 9 says the same of national aggressors: “בְּרֶשֶׁת־זוּ טָמְנוּ נִלְכְּדָה רַגְלָם” (“In the net they hid, their own foot was caught,” Ps 9:16). Here the verb “תָּפַשׂ,” to seize, pictures the trap springing on its owner. Radak hears this as prayer: not a description of what is happening, but a plea for an alternative moral physics where the oppressor’s plan collapses inward.

The engine of predation, the verse suggests, is “גַּאֲוָה”—haughty overreach. The Psalter repeatedly links pride to harm (Ps 73:6) and to doctrinal insolence (Ps 10:4). Pride here births pursuit (“burning chase”), a verb that lifts predation out of the accidental and into the willful. The second colon—“may they be caught”—is the first counter-move in the psalm’s chess: turn calculation back on the calculator.

**Verse 3**

כִּי־הִלֵּל רָשָׁע עַל־תַּאֲוַת נַפְשׁוֹ; וּבֹצֵעַ בֵּרֵךְ; נִאֵץ יְהוָה׃

The line names three things: boasting, grasping, blasphemy. The wicked “boasts” (הִלֵּל) “about the desire of his soul”: not merely “in” his desire but “about” it, as if desire itself were a credential. The noun תַּאֲוָה is appetite as theology. The second phrase is wonderfully paradoxical: “וּבֹצֵעַ בֵּרֵךְ”—“and the one who gains by violence (‘the extortioner’) blesses.” What can this mean? Either he blesses himself or others like him, or he wraps his acquisitiveness in pious language. Either way, the next word unmasks him: “נִאֵץ יְהוָה,” “he has reviled the LORD.”

Rabbinic tradition uses this verse to stigmatize ritual piety welded to injustice. “One who stole a measure of wheat, ground it, baked it, and recited the blessing over it—this is not a blessing but a blasphemy; of him Scripture says, ‘The extortioner blessed—he reviled the LORD’” (Bava Kamma 94a: “עַל זֶה נֶאֱמַר: בּוֹצֵעַ בֵּרֵךְ נִאֵץ ה׳”). The point is not a legal technicality; it is moral clarity: religion that sanctions exploitation profanes God’s Name.

The wicked’s “blessing” is therefore the mirror image of v. 7’s “full mouth” of oaths. He can talk God-talk; the psalm listens beneath it. “תַּאֲוַת נַפְשׁוֹ,” “the desire of his throat/life,” is a strong phrasing: the “throat” is where appetite lives. Psalm 10 will soon contrast this with “תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים” (“the desire of the lowly,” v. 17), which God actually hears.

**Verse 4**

רָשָׁע כְּגֹבַהּ אַפּוֹ בַּל־יִדְרֹשׁ; אֵין אֱלֹהִים כׇּל־מְזִמּוֹתָיו׃

A compact verse that requires unpacking. The phrase “כְּגֹבַהּ אַפּוֹ” literally, “according to the height of his nose,” is a physical caricature of pride—nose lifted high. From this posture flows “בַּל־יִדְרֹשׁ,” “he does not seek.” Seek what? Two intertwined meanings: (1) he does not seek God (compare Ps 14:2, “דֹּרֵשׁ אֶת־אֱלֹהִים”); (2) he lives as if God does not “seek” him, that is, does not investigate or require his deeds.

The second colon admits two precise readings: (a) “אֵין אֱלֹהִים” is a quoted creed: “There is no God—[so say] all his schemes.” This echoes Ps 14:1: “אָמַר נָבָל בְּלִבּוֹ: אֵין אֱלֹהִים” (“The benighted says in his heart: ‘There is no God’”). Or (b) syntactically, “God is not in all his schemes”—that is, God is absent from his calculations. Ibn Ezra and Radak prefer this practical atheism: not a metaphysical denial of God’s existence but a moral one, a life planned as if God will not weigh it.

Darash returns. The wicked “does not seek” (v. 4); he asserts God “does not call to account” (v. 13); the psalmist petitions God to “seek” the wickedness till none remains (v. 15). Elsewhere, the same verb can denote the divine investigation that safeguards justice: “דֹּרֵשׁ דָּמִים” (“the One who requires blood,” Ps 9:13). Psalm 10 hangs its theology on a verb.

**Verse 5**

יָחִילוּ דְרָכָיו בְּכָל־עֵת; מָרוֹם מִשְׁפָּטֶיךָ מִנֶּגְדּוֹ; כָּל־צֹרְרָיו יָפִיחַ בָּהֶם׃

A three-step portrayal of impunity. First, “יָחִילוּ דְרָכָיו”—not “writhe” here, but “are firm/prosper,” an attested sense of the root (cf. Job 20:21: “לֹא־יָחִיל טוּבוֹ,” “his prosperity will not endure”). And “בְּכָל־עֵת”: always. Second, “Your judgments are ‘מָרוֹם’—high—‘מִנֶּגְדּוֹ’—from before him”: justice exists, but far beyond his field of view. This spatial idiom reprises v. 1’s distance; what was “You standing far” becomes “Your judgments far” for him. Third, “he ‘snorts’ at all his foes” (פוח), a verb used elsewhere for contemptuous puffing (Prov 29:8: “אַנְשֵׁי לָצוֹן יָפִיחוּ קִרְיָה,” “scoffers inflame a city”).

The effect is crushing: unbroken success, inaccessible justice, effortless disdain. The psalm does not deny the phenomenon; it dares to articulate it. But by naming it in prayer, it invites a re-framing: if “Your judgments” are high, let Your “hand” be lifted (v. 12). The poem consistently answers spatial metaphors with spatial counter-metaphors.

**Verse 6**

אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ: בַּל־אֶמּוֹט; לְדֹר וָדֹר אֲשֶׁר לֹא־בְרָע׃

The first heart-speech. “בַּל־אֶמּוֹט,” “I shall not be moved,” is a line the Psalter puts in the mouth of the righteous, too—“שִׁוִּיתִי יְהוָה לְנֶגְדִּי תָמִיד… בַּל אֶמּוֹט” (“I set the LORD always before me… I shall not be moved,” Ps 16:8). Here it is presumption, not trust. “לְדֹר וָדֹר” makes the claim generational—his security is not just present but projected across time.

The relative clause “אֲשֶׁר לֹא־בְרָע” is compressed. Likely sense: “for generation upon generation—without evil touching me,” i.e., “never in trouble.” The heart-talk here is about permanence; later it becomes about theology: God’s forgetfulness (v. 11), God’s inaction (v. 13). Malbim shrewdly notes the progression: from personal invulnerability to a theory of divine disengagement.

This formula—“he says in his heart”—is a wisdom device across Scripture (Ps 14:1; Eccl 2:15). It exposes the logic behind behavior. In Psalm 10 that logic is chillingly coherent: if I am perpetually unshaken, therefore either God forgets me (or my victims), or there is no divine reckoning.

**Verse 7**

אָלָה פִּיהוּ מָלֵא; וּמִרְמוֹת וָתֹךְ; תַּחַת לְשׁוֹנוֹ עָמָל וָאָוֶן׃

The anatomy of harm shifts to speech. The mouth is “full” (מָלֵא)—not of praise but of “oaths” (אָלָה), “deceits” (מִרְמוֹת), and “תֹּךְ” (injurious fraud). The underside of the tongue hides “עָמָל וָאָוֶן”—mischief and iniquity. The idiom “under the tongue” recurs in Job 20:12: “אִם־יַמְתִּיק בְּפִיו רָעָה; יַכְחִידֶנָּה תַּחַת לְשׁוֹנוֹ” (“If evil is sweet in his mouth, he hides it under his tongue”). The psalm’s picture is of perjury (“oaths”) as a tool of deceit—words used to do violence.

The noun pair עָמָל/אָוֶן is a favorite in the Psalter for trouble with moral emptiness. Here the balance is elegant: public noise (full mouth) vs. hidden intent (under the tongue); performative vow vs. concealed malice. The psalm will later ask God, by contrast, to “incline Your ear” (v. 17)—divine hearing against human manipulation of speech.

**Verse 8**

יֵשֵׁב בְּמַאְרַב חֲצֵרִים; בַּמִּסְתָּרִים יַהֲרֹג נָקִי; עֵינָיו לְחֵלְכָה יִצְפֹּנוּ׃

The verbs and nouns fuse to make a scene. He “sits” in “ambush” (מַאְרַב) in “חֲצֵרִים”—villages, settlements. In “secret places” (מִסְתָּרִים) he “kills the innocent” (נָקִי). His “eyes” watch (יִצְפֹּנוּ, from צָפַן “to watch/hide/store”) “לְחֵלְכָה,” the helpless—a rare word (cf. vv. 10, 14), perhaps related to “חֵלֶךְ,” weakness/poverty.

The contrast of public space (“courts/settlements”) and hiding places captures the pervasiveness of predation—no zone is safe. Psalm 64 uses similar hunting imagery—“לִירוֹת בַּמִּסְתָּרִים תָּם; פִּתְאֹם יוֹרֻהוּ” (“to shoot in secret at the blameless; suddenly they shoot,” Ps 64:5)—for slander and conspiracy. Here the result is not reputation but blood (“יַהֲרֹג נָקִי”).

Rashi notes a masoretic curiosity: the form לְחֵלְכָה with final ה may be a graphic variant for the second person suffix (“your helpless one”), creating an address to God—“Your helpless one.” Even without that, the theological point stands: the poor belong to God; His law and prophets repeatedly claim them (Deut 10:18; Isa 11:4).

**Verse 9**

יֶאֱרֹב בַּמִּסְתָּר כְּאַרְיֵה בְּסֻכּוֹ; יֶאֱרֹב לַחֲטוֹף עָנִי; יַחְטֹף עָנִי בְּמֹשְׁכוֹ בְּרִשְׁתּוֹ׃

The image resolves: a lion in its lair (“כְּאַרְיֵה בְּסֻכּוֹ”), a hunter with a net. The double “יֶאֱרֹב” (“he lurks… he lurks”) builds the tension; the third colon releases it: “יַחְטֹף,” “he seizes,” “בְּמֹשְׁכוֹ בְּרִשְׁתּוֹ,” “as he draws his net.” The mix of metaphors is deliberate. In ancient iconography, kings and predators both hunt; the psalm suggests that the oppressor imitates both: a beast in stealth, a ruler wielding technology.

Psalm 9 already pictured the just reversal: “בְּרֶשֶׁת־זוּ טָמְנוּ נִלְכְּדָה רַגְלָם” (“In the net they hid, their foot was caught,” Ps 9:16). The shift from Ps 9 (plurals; “nations”) to Ps 10 (singular; “the wicked”) is instructive: the problem is one, whether it wears a crown or a mask.

**Verse 10**

יִדְכֶּה יָשֹׁחַ; וְנָפַל בַּעֲצוּמָיו; חֵל כָּאִים׃ [Qere]

The verse is textually difficult and therefore evocative. The Qere (the traditional reading) yields “יִדְכֶּה יָשֹׁחַ”—“he crouches, he bows down”—keeping the predator subject from v. 9. Then, “וְנָפַל בַּעֲצוּמָיו”—“and there falls, by his might” (or “by his strong [ones/forces]”), “חֵל כָּאִים”—“a host of crushed ones.” The Ketiv (consonantal text) can be read differently, with “וְדָכָה”—“and is crushed”—shifting subject, and “חֵלְכָאִים” as one word.

Radak offers a different angle: sometimes the band feigns weakness (“דָכָה,” crushed) to lure travelers into complacency; then “חֵל כָּאִים”—a band of crushed-looking folk—falls on them “בַּעֲצוּמָיו,” revealing their strength. Ibn Ezra keeps the lion focus: “בַּעֲצוּמָיו” could be the lion’s powerful limbs. The ambiguity may be the point: the victim falls beneath an unspecified “might”—claws, accomplices, policy—whatever tools tyranny employs.

The verb דָּכָה (“to crush”) appears elsewhere in plaintive prayers: “לֵב נִדְכֶּה” (“a contrite heart,” Ps 51:19). Here, the “crushed” are crushed not by God’s discipline but by human force. The crescendo of verbs—crouch, bow, fall—creates a visual descent. The poem has reached the moral bottom.

**Verse 11**

אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ: שָׁכַח אֵל; הִסְתִּיר פָּנָיו; בַּל־רָאָה לָנֶצַח׃

The second heart-speech states the theology of absence in three clauses. “שָׁכַח אֵל”—“God has forgotten.” “הִסְתִּיר פָּנָיו”—“He has hidden His face.” “בַּל־רָאָה לָנֶצַח”—“He will never see.” The adverb “לָנֶצַח” could mean “forever” or “for a long time,” but the effect is a total denial of divine sight across time.

Deuteronomy 31:17 provides the covenant background: “וְחָרָה אַפִּי… וְעָזַבְתִּים, וְהִסְתַּרְתִּי פָנַי מֵהֶם… וּמְצָאֻהוּ רָעוֹת רַבּוֹת” (“My anger will flare up… I will abandon them, and hide My face from them… and many evils shall befall them”). The wicked here takes Israel’s fear (“God has hidden His face”) and uses it as a license. Psalm 94 corrects him: “הֲנֹטַע אֹזֶן, הֲלֹא יִשְׁמָע; אִם־יוֹצֵר עַיִן, הֲלֹא יַבִּיט” (“He who planted the ear, shall He not hear? He who formed the eye, shall He not behold?” Ps 94:9). Psalm 10 will answer with the same logic in v. 14: “רָאִיתָה… תַּבִּיט”—You do see.

**Verse 12**

קוּמָה יְהוָה; אֵל נְשָׂא יָדֶךָ; אַל־תִּשְׁכַּח עֲנָוִים׃

The pivot from description to petition. Three imperatives—or better, pleas: “Arise, LORD”; “O God, lift Your hand”; “Do not forget the lowly (עֲנָוִים/עֲנִיִּים).” The verb קוּמָה is a standard cry for intervention (Ps 7:7: “קוּמָה יְהוָה בְּאַפֶּךָ,” “Arise, LORD, in Your anger”), and “lift the hand” signals power displayed and action undertaken (cf. Isa 49:22). Where v. 5 lamented that “Your judgments” are “high” and far, now God’s “hand” is asked to be high and near.

The final clause answers v. 11’s “שָׁכַח אֵל” (“God has forgotten”) with “אַל־תִּשְׁכַּח” (“do not forget”). The Qere reads “עֲנָוִים,” “the lowly/humble,” a term that in the Psalter often denotes both social vulnerability and spiritual posture (cf. Ps 37:11). It is fitting that this verse has become the language of the High Holidays: “Prepare their heart; incline Your ear” (v. 17) is the next step in the liturgical chain.

**Verse 13**

עַל־מֶה נִאֵץ רָשָׁע אֱלֹהִים; אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ: לֹא תִדְרֹשׁ׃

The psalmist’s second “Why?” This time the question is directed not at God’s distance but at the wicked’s insolence: “On what basis does the wicked scorn God?” The answer is in his heart: “You do not call to account” (לֹא תִדְרֹשׁ). The verb brings the thread back to v. 4. A theology of impunity authorizes contempt.

The Psalter elsewhere insists on the opposite: “דֹּרֵשׁ דָּמִים אֹתָם זָכָר; לֹא־שָׁכַח צַעֲקַת עֲנִיִּים” (“The One who requires blood remembered them; He did not forget the cry of the afflicted,” Ps 9:13). Psalm 10 is in dialogue with Psalm 9 at exactly this point: remembrance and requital against the wicked’s creed of forgetfulness and non-reckoning.

**Verse 14**

רָאִיתָה—כִּי אַתָּה עָמָל וָכַעַס תַּבִּיט—לָתֵת בְּיָדֶךָ; עָלֶיךָ יַעֲזֹב חֵלֵכָה; יָתוֹם אַתָּה הָיִיתָ עוֹזֵר׃

This is the psalm’s hinge. The fronted perfect “רָאִיתָה” (“You have seen/You do see”) answers v. 11’s “He will never see” with an emphatic contradiction. The reason clause specifies what God sees: “עָמָל וָכַעַס”—mischief and vexation. The purpose clause “לָתֵת בְּיָדֶךָ” means “to take [it] into Your hand”—to take charge of redressing it. Rashi, pressed by the Hebrew, reads “to give him his recompense.”

“עָלֶיךָ יַעֲזֹב חֵלֵכָה”—the helpless “leaves” his burden “upon You,” a Hebrew idiom for entrusting (compare “גּוֹל עַל־יְהוָה דַּרְכֶּךָ,” “Commit your way to the LORD,” Ps 37:5). Finally, “יָתוֹם… עוֹזֵר”—“You have been the orphan’s helper.” The perfect (“have been”) appeals to God’s track record to secure present intervention. Deuteronomy’s portrait of God—“עֹשֶׂה מִשְׁפַּט יָתוֹם וְאַלְמָנָה”—is the theological underneath.

The verse’s rhythm (assertion—cause—purpose—entrustment—appeal to precedent) models a way to argue with God: tell Him what He has been and thus what He must be.

**Verse 15**

שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רָשָׁע; וָרָע תִּדְרֹשׁ רִשְׁעוֹ; בַּל־תִּמְצָא׃

The imperative, now muscular. “Break the arm of the wicked.” Then the verb darash in its climactic turn: “Seek out his wickedness until you find none”—that is, investigate thoroughly until evil is exhausted. Radak reads the line as promise: if You do this, “לא תמצא רשע בארץ,” “You will not find wickedness in the land.” The imagery is political: to “break the arm” is to disable power structures (Jer 48:25). The Talmud connects our verse to the petition against malicious sectarians in the Amidah (Megillah 17b), and Ashkenazi Yom Kippur poetry uses it as a communal plea for the end of oppression: “שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רֶשַׁע.”

The line thus rewrites the wicked’s creed. Against “You do not seek” stands “Seek!”; against “I shall not be moved” stands the broken arm. The imperative form matters: it gives the worshiper words to demand that God be God.

**Verse 16**

יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ עוֹלָם וָעֶד; אָבְדוּ גוֹיִם מֵאַרְצוֹ׃

A burst of doxology. “The LORD is king forever and ever.” The second colon uses a perfect, “אָבְדוּ,” “have perished,” to describe a reality future to the psalmist but certain in the horizon of faith. This “prophetic perfect” functions liturgically as a declaration that, even in apparent absence, God rules, and that earthly powers—“גוֹיִם”—are temporary tenants in “His land.”

This verse stands, in Sefardic Pesukei DeZimra, immediately after “יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ; יְהוָה מָלָךְ; יְהוָה יִמְלֹךְ לְעוֹלָם וָעֶד” and before “יְהוָה הֵפִיר עֲצַת גּוֹיִם” (“The LORD foils the plans of nations,” Ps 33:10). The juxtaposition is the psalm’s best interpreter. God’s kingship is not a pious overlay; it is public truth, visibly contradicted for a time by wicked success but finally vindicated as counsel proves futile.

**Verse 17**

תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים שָׁמַעְתָּ יְהוָה; תָּכִין לִבָּם; תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ׃

Perfect followed by imperfects: “You have heard… You will establish… You will incline.” The object—“תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים,” the desire of the lowly—answers v. 3’s “תַּאֲוַת נַפְשׁוֹ,” the appetite of the wicked. What God hears is not appetite but prayer-shaped longing for justice. “תָּכִין לִבָּם,” “You will make their hearts firm,” resonates in High Holiday liturgy: “תָּכִין לִבָּם, תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ”—God prepares the heart that prays and bends His ear to hear it.

The verb “קשב” (to pay close attention) casts God as the opposite of the wicked’s creed of divine blindness. Psalm 71:2 uses the same idiom: “הַטֵּה אֵלַי אָזְנֶךָ, וְהוֹשִׁיעֵנִי” (“Incline Your ear to me, and deliver me”). Listening itself is an act of salvation.

**Verse 18**

לִשְׁפֹּט יָתוֹם וָדָךְ; בַּל־יוֹסִיף עוֹד לַעֲרֹץ אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָרֶץ׃

The finale states the purpose. “לִשְׁפֹּט”—to judge in the biblical sense of vindicating the right of the powerless (Deut 10:18: “עֹשֶׂה מִשְׁפַּט יָתוֹם וְאַלְמָנָה”). The subjects are the “יָתוֹם” and the “דָּךְ” (crushed/lowly). The result: “בַּל־יוֹסִיף עוֹד לַעֲרֹץ”—“that he will no longer continue to terrify.” The verb “עָרַץ” in the causative (“terrify”) elsewhere forbids fear of enemies (Deut 1:29: “אַל־תַּעַרְצוּן,” “do not be terrified”); here it stigmatizes the oppressor’s chief weapon: fear.

The oppressor is named “אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָרֶץ,” “a mortal of the earth”—a precise, deflating term. In contrast to “יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ עוֹלָם,” God is eternal; man is earth-bound. Radak comments that this emphasizes both mortality and limited power. The psalm closes by restoring perspective: the affliction is real and named; the terror is human and temporary; the kingship is divine and forever.

In sum: Psalm 10 offers us not an explanation but a practice. It teaches how to protest, how to diagnose, how to demand, and how to praise—until the act of speaking to God undercuts the wicked’s line that no one is listening.
