Note on terminology: A “colon” is one line in a Hebrew poetic pair. When I refer to a “perfect” verb, I mean a past/perfective form often used in Hebrew poetry to express certainty; a “jussive” is a form that expresses a wish or command (“may he be caught”).

**Verse 1**

לָמָה יְהוָה תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָחוֹק; תַּעְלִים לְעִתּוֹת בַּצָּרָה׃

“Why, O YHWH, do You stand far off; [why] do You hide in times of trouble?”

The psalm opens with twin “why” questions (לָמָה… תַּעֲמֹד; תַּעְלִים). The spatial verbs do the work. עָמַד (“to stand”) typically signals presence and readiness; here, “stand far off” (תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָחוֹק) pictures the divine as a bystander. תַּעְלִים (“You hide”) derives from עלם (“conceal”) and is sharpened by the timing phrase “in times of trouble” (לְעִתּוֹת בַּצָּרָה). The poet is not complaining about general divine mystery, but about the experience that concealment peaks precisely when help is needed. The same idiom of hiding the face bespeaks covenant judgment in the Torah: “Then My anger will flare… and I will hide My face from them” (וְחָרָה אַפִּי… וְהִסְתַּרְתִּי פָנַי מֵהֶם, Deut 31:17–18). Later psalms turn the question directly to God: “How long will You hide Your face from me?” (Ps 13:2).

Radak frames Psalm 10 as a general prayer for anyone oppressed, not a single historical crisis. That choice fits the diction. “Times of trouble” (עִתּוֹת) and “standing far” (בְּרָחוֹק) leave particulars unspecified. The line also establishes a thematic irony: the wicked in verse 11 will say nearly the same words (“He hides His face”; “He will never see”), but as a taunt. The righteous laments hiddenness as a crisis of relationship; the wicked treat hiddenness as license.

Stylistically, the terseness intensifies the plea. Hebrew poetry often omits conjunctions and connectors; the reader must infer the relation between cola. Here we hear a beat of accusation and a beat of ache. It’s a textbook instance of what scholars call parallelism: “A is so, and what’s more, B”—“You stand far; and what’s more, You hide when we most need You.”

**Verse 2**

בְּגַאֲוַת רָשָׁע יִדְלַק עָנִי; יִתָּפְשׂוּ בִּמְזִמּוֹת זוּ חָשָׁבוּ׃

“In the arrogance of the wicked the poor is hotly pursued; may they be caught in the schemes they devised.”

The first colon names a cause: “by the arrogance (בְּגַאֲוַת) of the wicked” the poor (עָנִי) are pursued. The verb יִדְלַק (from דלק) is visceral: in Genesis 31:36 it means “pursue hotly” (כִּי דָלַקְתָּ אַחֲרַי). Pride animates the hunt. The victims are plural in the psalm (עָנִי; יָתוֹם; דָּךְ): Hebrew varies the nouns to insist that the vulnerable wear many faces.

The second colon pivots to prayer: יִתָּפְשׂוּ (“may they be caught”) turns description into imprecation, asking for measure-for-measure justice. The archaic demonstrative זוּ (“this”) in זוּ חָשָׁבוּ gives the line a chiseled sound. Echoes abound elsewhere: “The nations sank in the pit they made; their own foot is caught in the net they hid” (טָבְעוּ גוֹיִם בְּשַׁחַת עָשׂוּ; בְּרֶשֶׁת־זוּ טָמָנוּ נִלְכְּדָה רַגְלָם, Ps 9:16). The pattern is a moral physics of retribution embedded in the prayer: the trapper trips himself.

The construction illustrates Hebrew “staircase” parallelism: the second colon doesn’t merely restate the first; it completes it by naming the hoped-for outcome. The wicked’s arrogance becomes not just motive but the very snare into which he should fall.

**Verse 3**

כִּי־הִלֵּל רָשָׁע עַל־תַּאֲוַת נַפְשׁוֹ; וּבֹצֵעַ בֵּרֵךְ נִאֵץ יְהוָה׃

“For the wicked boasts about his soul’s desire; the greedy one blesses [himself]—he despises YHWH.”

The wicked’s appetite becomes his praise. הִלֵּל (“boast/praise”) usually takes a worthy object; here the wicked “boasts about the craving of his own life” (עַל־תַּאֲוַת נַפְשׁוֹ), turning appetite into a liturgy of the self. The second colon shocks: “the בֹּצֵעַ (the extortionist/greedy) blesses—he despises YHWH.” How can one “bless” and “despise” in the same breath? Rabbinic tradition seized on the paradox. The Torah Temimah (citing Bava Kamma 94a) records: “If one stole a measure of wheat, ground it, baked it, and separated challah—how does he bless? He is not blessing but blaspheming; concerning this it is said, בֹּצֵעַ בֵּרֵךְ נִאֵץ יְהוָה.” In Sanhedrin 6b the dictum “Let the law pierce the mountain” is paired with “one who praises the ‘botzea’ (one who cuts a deal at justice’s expense) is blaspheming”—twisting piety to varnish injustice.

The word-pair is theologically explosive: “blesses” (בֵּרֵךְ) and “despises” (נִאֵץ). נָאֵץ appears in polemical contexts: “How long… shall the enemy revile Your name?” (יְנָאֵץ אוֹיֵב שִׁמְךָ, Ps 74:10). The verse anatomizes a religious perversion: a mouth that pronounces benediction to sanctify grasping. It is the first step down the slope toward verse 11’s “God has forgotten.”

—

**Verse 4**

רָשָׁע כְּגֹבַהּ אַפּוֹ בַּל־יִדְרֹשׁ; אֵין אֱלֹהִים כָּל־מְזִמּוֹתָיו׃

“The wicked—according to the height of his nose—‘does not seek’; ‘There is no God’ is all his schemes.”

Two hard phrases require attention. First, “according to the height of his nose” (כְּגֹבַהּ אַפּוֹ): אַף is “nose,” hence “face” and by extension “anger.” The picture is someone literally holding his nose high—a physical arrogance that mirrors spiritual posture (cf. Prov 30:13). Second, “בַּל־יִדְרֹשׁ” is either “he does not seek [God]” or “He [God] does not ‘seek/call to account’.” The ambiguity is productive; both are true of the wicked’s worldview.

The next clause may be read, with Ibn Ezra, “God is not in all his schemes”—i.e., the wicked plans as if God were irrelevant. Or, with echoes of Ps 14:1, it’s a naked creed: “There is no God [in/for] all his plans.” In either case, דרש (“seek”) will become the poem’s hinge in vv.13 and 15.

Psalm 94:9 answers the implied claim: God’s hearing and seeing are baked into creation itself. The wicked’s high nose is a metaphorical affront to the One who “formed the eye.”

**Verse 5**

יָחִילוּ דְרָכָיו בְּכָל־עֵת; מָרוֹם מִשְׁפָּטֶיךָ מִנֶּגְדּוֹ; כָּל־צֹרְרָיו יָפִיחַ בָּהֶם׃

“His ways are firm/prosper at all times; Your judgments are high, out of his sight; all his foes he snorts at.”

The verb יָחִילוּ (from חוּל) can mean “writhe,” but here (as in Job 20:21: לֹא יָחִיל טוּבוֹ) it denotes “endure/prosper.” The wicked’s road seems stable “at all times,” a phrase that mockingly parallels “in times of trouble” (v.1). Next are the spatial metaphors: “Your judgments are מָרוֹם (high), מִנֶּגְדּוֹ (away from before him).” The wicked experiences divine justice as remote—too elevated to be reckoned with. Finally, “he snorts/puffs at all his foes” (יָפִיחַ), a contemptuous breath that dismisses opposition.

The Talmud (Berakhot 7b) warns against provoking a wicked person when “the hour smiles at him,” citing this verse: “His ways prosper… Your judgments are far from him.” It is a psychological realism: there are seasons when evil is inexplicably buoyant. The psalm does not blink.

—

**Verse 6**

אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ: בַּל־אֶמּוֹט; לְדֹר וָדֹר אֲשֶׁר לֹא בְרָע׃

“He says in his heart: ‘I shall not be moved; for generation and generation I [am] not in trouble.’”

The first of three heart-sayings. בַּל־אֶמּוֹט (“I shall not be moved”) is a phrase the righteous also use—“Because He is at my right hand, I shall not be moved” (Ps 16:8). On the lips of the wicked it becomes presumption. The temporal inflation “לְדֹר וָדֹר” claims trans-generational immunity. Rashi paraphrases: no harm will ever befall me or my house. The claim parodies God’s own “generation to generation” faithfulness (Ps 33:11; 119:90). Arrogance imitates eternity.

The interior monologues trace a descent: first personal invulnerability (v.6), then divine inattention (v.11), finally denial of judgment (v.13). It is a psychology of impunity.

—

**Verse 7**

אָלָה פִּיהוּ מָלֵא; וּמִרְמוֹת וָתֹךְ; תַּחַת לְשׁוֹנוֹ עָמָל וָאָוֶן׃

“His mouth is full of oaths; and deceits and oppression; under his tongue are mischief and iniquity.”

A somatic map of evil speech: mouth and tongue. אָלָה is “oath,” often self-maledictory; here likely false oaths to launder fraud. תֹךְ is rare, akin to oppression or harm (cf. Ps 72:14). The phrase “under his tongue” (תַּחַת לְשׁוֹנוֹ) is vivid: concealed malice, venom stored for the strike. Job uses the same image: “Though evil is sweet in his mouth… he hides it under his tongue” (יַכְחִידֶנָּה תַּחַת לְשׁוֹנוֹ, Job 20:12). The paired nouns עָמָל וָאָוֶן recur in portraits of harm (Ps 7:15; 94:20). Words in this psalm both conceal and reveal—an interior theology (“he says in his heart”) and an exterior rhetoric (“his mouth is full”). The mismatch is the point.

—

**Verse 8**

יֵשֵׁב בְּמַאְרַב חֲצֵרִים; בַּמִּסְתָּרִים יַהֲרֹג נָקִי; עֵינָיו לְחֵלְכָה יִצְפֹּנוּ׃

“He sits in ambush in the villages; in the secret places he kills the innocent; his eyes spy on the helpless.”

The verbs are patient and predatory: “sits” (יֵשֵׁב), “kills” (יַהֲרֹג), “spies” (יִצְפֹּנוּ, from צפן “to hide/store/lie in wait”). The settings—villages and secret places—suggest ubiquity: public squares rife with private violence. The object “נָקִי” (innocent) makes the moral charge explicit: this is not warfare; it is murder. The rare noun חֵלְכָה (wretched/helpless) recurs in vv.10, 14. Masoretically it looks like “your helpless one,” which Rashi hears as God’s people; but as a collective it likely means “the helpless” more generally. The lion/allusions gather (see v.9), echoing Ps 7:3’s “lest he tear like a lion.” Psalm 64:5 offers an arresting parallel for tactics: “to shoot from hiding at the blameless” (לִירֹת בַּמִּסְתָּרִים תָּם).

Against the wicked’s ever-watchful eye stands the divine eye: “You do look” (v.14). The competing gazes—predator and Protector—frame the psalm’s pivot.

—

**Verse 9**

יֶאֱרֹב בַּמִּסְתָּר כְּאַרְיֵה בְסֻכּוֹ; יֶאֱרֹב לַחֲטֹף עָנִי; יַחְטֹף עָנִי בְּמָשְׁכוֹ בְרִשְׁתּוֹ׃

“He lurks in secret like a lion in his lair; he lurks to seize the poor; he seizes the poor by dragging him in his net.”

The simile is explicit: “like a lion in his shelter” (כְּאַרְיֵה בְסֻכּוֹ). Elsewhere Israel is likened to a lion that none dare rouse (Num 24:9). Here the wicked borrows the image to predatory ends. The mixed metaphor—cat and net—is pointed: this is not just brute force but also apparatus and strategy. Psalm 31:5 puts the righteous on the other end of the image: “You will bring me out of the net they hid for me” (תּוֹצִיאֵנִי מֵרֶשֶׁת זוּ טָמְנוּ לִי).

The triple cadence—יֶאֱרֹב… יֶאֱרֹב… יַחְטֹף—feels like stalking escalating to pounce. The repetition is a classic “staircase” move. The psalm invites the reader to feel the hunt.

—

**Verse 10**

יִדְכֶּה יָשֹׁחַ; וְנָפַל בַּעֲצוּמָיו חֵל כָּאִים׃ (Qere)

“He crouches, he bows; and the crushed company falls by his strong [power].”

This line is textually thorny. The Ketiv/Qere (the written vs. read forms preserved by the Masoretes) differ at several points. The Qere (as above) makes the wicked the subject of the crouching verbs—“he crouches (יִדְכֶּה), he bows (יָשֹׁחַ)”—a hunter lowering himself before the spring. The second colon’s “חֵל כָּאִים” (read as two words) means “a company of the afflicted”; they “fall by his עֲצוּמָיו”—either “his mighty [limbs]” (Ibn Ezra) or “his powerful means.” Rashi and Radak offer another stratagem: the wicked may “make himself crushed and bowed” to ingratiate and then attack when unguarded.

Either way, the motion is downward: an ambushed vulnerable group collapses under “strong” force. The ambiguity itself conveys the wicked’s guile. The Ketiv/Qere here models how the ancient tradition preserved multiple plausible senses, inviting, not foreclosing, interpretation.

—

**Verse 11**

אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ: שָׁכַח אֵל; הִסְתִּיר פָּנָיו; בַּל־רָאָה לָנֶצַח׃

“He says in his heart: ‘God has forgotten; He has hidden His face; He will never see.’”

The second heart-saying makes a theological claim across three clauses, moving from memory (שָׁכַח) to presence (הִסְתִּיר פָּנָיו) to sight (בַּל־רָאָה לָנֶצַח). It is a totalizing denial: God neither remembers, nor regards, nor sees. As noted, these phrases echo Israel’s own lament (Ps 13:2; 44:25). Psalm 94’s retort should be read alongside: “He who formed the eye—shall He not look?” (אִם־יֹצֵר עַיִן הֲלֹא יַבִּיט). The psalmist’s reply comes in v.14 with a counter-assertion in the perfect: “You have seen.”

Ibn Ezra astutely notes that the wicked’s theology is experiential, not philosophical: impunity masquerades as proof. That is why Psalm 10’s rebuttal is not argument but prayer; to address God is to refuse the premise of divine absence.

—

**Verse 12**

קוּמָה יְהוָה; אֵל, נְשָׂא יָדֶךָ; אַל־תִּשְׁכַּח עֲנָוִים׃

“Arise, O YHWH; O God, lift up Your hand; do not forget the humble.”

The imperatives pile up. קוּמָה (“Arise!”) is a liturgical cry that punctuates other laments (Ps 3:8; 7:7): move from apparent standing off to action. “Lift up Your hand” (נְשָׂא יָדֶךָ) is an idiom of readiness to strike or to act in power. The double divine name—YHWH, El—adds solemn weight.

“Do not forget the humble” (עֲנָוִים; many manuscripts read עֲנִיִּים, “poor”) answers the wicked’s charge that God forgets (v.11). The prayer operates like a legal objection: Your Honor, the defense asserts neglect; we request visible action for the lowly. In High Holiday piyyutim, this verse’s neighbor (10:17) becomes the prayer leader’s plea: “Prepare their heart; incline Your ear.” The psalm teaches us to ask for help to ask for help.

—

**Verse 13**

עַל־מֶה נִאֵץ רָשָׁע אֱלֹהִים; אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ, לֹא תִדְרֹשׁ׃

“Why does the wicked despise God? He has said in his heart, ‘You do not call to account.’”

The psalm’s second question turns from God (v.1) to the wicked. The answer is immediate: his contempt (נִאֵץ) grows from his creed—“You do not derosh,” i.e., you do not investigate, require, or avenge. The verb דרש thus completes its triad across the psalm (vv.4, 13, 15). The line also resonates with Deuteronomy’s use of דרש for legal inquiry (“you shall investigate and inquire,” Deut 13:15) and obligation (“the LORD your God will surely require it of you,” Deut 23:22). The wicked’s claim strikes at the heart of covenantal justice.

Malbim parses the heart-sayings as a progression: first “I will not be moved,” then “God doesn’t see,” finally “God doesn’t require.” Psalm 10 replies to each in turn.

—

**Verse 14**

רָאִיתָה, כִּי אַתָּה עָמָל וָכַעַס תַּבִּיט; לָתֵת בְּיָדֶךָ; עָלֶיךָ יַעֲזֹב חֵלֶכָה; יָתוֹם אַתָּה הָיִיתָ עוֹזֵר׃

“You do see! For You behold mischief and vexation, to take [it] into Your hand; upon You the helpless leaves [his case]; You have been the orphan’s helper.”

The verb fronting is emphatic: רָאִיתָה—You have seen/You do see. The next clause spells out what is seen: “עָמָל וָכַעַס” (harm and vexation), pairing terms used of the wicked’s speech (v.7) and aim. “To give into Your hand” (לָתֵת בְּיָדֶךָ) means, most plausibly, “to take it in hand”—to assume the case. The line then shifts from God’s agency to the sufferer’s: “Upon You the helpless leaves” (יַעֲזֹב), a verb also used for entrusting burdens (cf. Ps 55:23). Finally the psalm appeals to precedent: “You have been the orphan’s helper.” The perfect (“have been”) serves as a theological memory: You have done this; do it again.

Psalm 94 similarly invokes God’s attentive senses as grounds for hope: “Were it not for YHWH my help, my soul would soon dwell in silence” (לוּלֵי יְהוָה עֶזְרָתָה לִּי, Ps 94:17). Here and there, the path out of theodicy is not speculation but recollection and address.

—

**Verse 15**

שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רָשָׁע; וָרָע תִּדְרוֹשׁ רִשְׁעוֹ, בַּל־תִּמְצָא׃

“Break the arm of the wicked; and as for the evil one—seek out his wickedness until You find none.”

“Breaking the arm” is biblical shorthand for disarming a regime (Jer 48:25; Ezek 30:21–22). Psalm 10 maps this political metaphor onto individual oppression. The second colon fulfills the psalm’s wordplay: having been told “You do not derosh” (v.13), the poet asks God to derosh wickedness so thoroughly that “none is found.” Read that end-clause as result: investigate so completely that wrongdoing is exhausted.

The prayer’s halakhic echo surfaces in Megillah 17b, which links giving the ninth Amidah blessing (against sectarians) with this verse in spirit: justice requires the curbing of malicious power. In Ashkenazi Yom Kippur Musaf, the verse is sung as a cry for the end of oppression: “Break the arm of wickedness; You alone reign.” The politics of the psalm is not party or class; it is the defense of the defenseless.

—

**Verse 16**

יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ עוֹלָם וָעֶד; אָבְדוּ גוֹיִם מֵאַרְצוֹ׃

“YHWH is King forever and ever; the nations have perished from His land.”

The genre shifts mid-lament to enthronement. Similar declarations saturate Psalms 93–99. The perfect “have perished” (אָבְדוּ) is not a statistical claim but a liturgical one: the psalm speaks the verdict as if accomplished, a rhetorical device sometimes called the “prophetic perfect.” Rashi and Radak hear an eschatological note: once God judges oppressors, His kingship will be manifest universally.

In daily Sefardic prayer, this line buttresses the trilogy “YHWH has reigned, is King, will reign,” turning Psalm 10’s hard-won confidence into the community’s routine confession.

—

**Verse 17**

תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים שָׁמַעְתָּ יְהוָה; תָּכִין לִבָּם; תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ׃

“The desire of the humble You have heard, O YHWH; You will steady their heart; You will incline Your ear.”

The verbs move from a perfect (“You have heard”) to imperfects of confidence (“You will steady… You will incline”). The humble have a “desire” (תַּאֲוָה); earlier the wicked boasted of “the desire of his soul” (תַּאֲוַת נַפְשׁוֹ, v.3). The psalm pits appetites against each other: acquisitive desire vs. desire for vindication. The phrase “steady their heart” (תָּכִין לִבָּם) is exquisite: God must help people pray before God hears their prayer. Liturgy takes this literally. The High Holiday shaliach tzibbur pleads: “Prepare their heart; incline Your ear,” admitting that the congregation needs God even to reach for God.

This line replies to v.1’s “hide” and v.11’s “never see.” Not only does God see; He hears—and He readies hearts to be heard.

—

**Verse 18**

לִשְׁפֹּט יָתוֹם וָדָךְ; בַּל־יוֹסִיף עוֹד לַעֲרֹץ אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָרֶץ׃

“to champion the orphan and the crushed; that a mortal of the earth no longer terrify.”

To “judge” (שָׁפַט) here is not neutral procedure; it is advocacy—“to take up the case” of those without help (cf. Deut 10:18). The purpose is stated negatively: “that a mortal (אֱנוֹשׁ) of the earth no longer terrify” (לַעֲרֹץ). The rare verb ערץ carries the sense “strike terror” (cf. Isa 8:12; Deut 1:29). The phrase “man of the earth” is not anti-human; it is anti-hubris. Human beings are dust-bound; God’s kingship is forever. Psalm 146:10 says it simply: “YHWH shall reign forever… for generation and generation.” The psalm’s last word holds a future: terror will cease where God’s reign is acknowledged and the orphan is defended.

That is the psalm’s entire arc. Protest gives way to petition; petition yields to proclamation; proclamation circles back to the orphan at the gate. The alphabet is broken, but the prayer is whole.
