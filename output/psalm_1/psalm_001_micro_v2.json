Three distinct categories of evildoers are presented: רְשָׁעִים (wicked), חַטָּאִים (sinners), לֵצִים (scoffers/insolent). The verb progression suggests a trajectory from casual contact to settled commitment to evil.",

    "Why is the tree described as 'planted' (שָׁתוּל) rather than naturally growing - what does intentional placement suggest?",
    "How does the progressive verb sequence (walked→stood→sat) relate to ancient Near Eastern concepts of moral decline?",
    "What does the divine 'knowing' (יוֹדֵעַ) of the righteous way imply - mere awareness, approval, or covenantal care?",
    "Why is the chaff metaphor so compressed compared to the elaborate tree imagery - is brevity itself the point?",
    "How does the judicial language in v.5 relate to the nature metaphors - is this present reality or eschatological future?"
