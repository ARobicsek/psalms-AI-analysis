The wicked lack elaborate description—poetic form enacts message of insubstantiality. Chaff imagery: agricultural waste, weightless, blown away (תִּדְּפֶנּוּ רוּחַ). No rootedness, no permanence, no fruitfulness—defined entirely by absence and dispersal. Structural asymmetry is striking: 3 verses for righteous, half-verse for wicked core image.",

  "interesting_questions": [
    "What is the precise semantic range and function of יֶהְגֶּה (meditate/mutter) in v. 2—does it indicate vocalized recitation, embodied murmuring, or silent contemplation, and how does this compare with its usage in Josh 1:8 and Ps 2:1?",
    "Why does the triadic progression in v. 1 use specifically הָלַךְ/עָמָד/יָשָׁב (walk/stand/sit)—are these technical terms for levels of social commitment, spatial metaphors for proximity to wickedness, or synonymous variations for poetic effect?",
    "What is the theological significance of שָׁתוּל (planted) being a passive participle in v. 3—does this suggest divine agency in positioning the righteous, and if so, how does this affect interpretation of human moral responsibility?",
    "How do the three wicked categories in v. 1 (רְשָׁעִים/חַטָּאִים/לֵצִים - wicked/sinners/scoffers) relate to each other—are they progressive stages of moral deterioration, distinct types of wickedness, or synonymous terms, and what is the specific nuance of לֵצִים?",
    "What does יוֹדֵעַ (knows) connote in v. 6—is this epistemological awareness, covenantal/relational recognition (as in Amos 3:2; Gen 18:19), or constitutive ontological knowing that brings reality into being?",
    "What is בַּמִּשְׁפָּט (the judgment) in v. 5—earthly legal proceeding, divine judgment scene, eschatological event, or all three, and does יָקֻמוּ (stand/arise) carry resurrection imagery or purely judicial connotations?",
    "What is the agricultural and cultural background of מֹץ (chaff) imagery in v. 4, and how does this relate to threshing floor scenes as judgment contexts elsewhere in Scripture (Ruth 3; 2 Sam 24; prophetic literature)?",
    "Why is the description of the wicked so dramatically brief compared to the righteous (structural asymmetry)—is this aesthetic choice, rhetorical strategy, or theological statement about substance vs insubstantiality?",
    "What is עֲדַת צַדִּיקִים (assembly of the righteous) in v. 5—liturgical/cultic gathering, eschatological community, covenant assembly, or metaphor for blessed state, and how does עֵדָה function elsewhere in Psalms?",
    "How does the passive תֹּאבֵד (perishes) in v. 6 differ from active divine judgment language—does the wicked way self-destruct through lack of divine knowing, or is this euphemistic language for divine destruction?",
    "What is the function of כִּי in vv. 2 and 6—causal (because), emphatic (indeed), adversative (but), or explanatory, and how does this affect the logical and theological flow of the psalm?",
    "Does פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם (streams/channels of water) in v. 3 suggest natural watercourses or engineered irrigation channels, and does this distinction matter for understanding divine vs human agency in flourishing?",
    "How does Psalm 1's use of הָגָה (meditate) in v. 2 for Torah study contrast with Psalm 2:1's use of the same verb for nations 'plotting'—is this intentional wordplay establishing contrasting meditations?"
