Open the Psalter and you are not yet praying; you are being taught how to pray. Psalm 1 is instruction first, devotion after. It lays out the “two ways” with a clarity that is almost austere, then hands you a set of images—roads, a tree, chaff—to carry through the rest of the book. Its simplicity is deceptive. The poem does not argue in abstractions; it narrates a moral trajectory you can feel in your legs: “Happy the person” (אַשְׁרֵי־הָאִישׁ, `'ash-rēy-hā-'IY-sh`) who does not walk, stand, sit where evil thrives (v. 1). The verbs mark a slide from motion to stasis, from passing contact to settled identity. And then comes the positive counter-movement: a delight (חֵפֶץ, ḥef-TSŌ) in Torah that becomes daily practice, “day and night” (יוֹמָם וָלָיְלָה, yō-MĀM wā-LĀ-ye-lāh), a merism—two poles that mean “always.”

Two small details carry large freight. First, the Torah is “of YHWH” (תּוֹרַת יְהוָה) and, in the next breath, “his Torah” (תּוֹרָתוֹ). As Rashi already noted, the shift signals internalization: what begins as divine instruction becomes one’s own through labor and love. Rabbinic tradition pushes this further. In a debate about whether a teacher’s honor can be waived, Rava finally says it cannot be—then qualifies: “Is the Torah his? Indeed not… for it is written, ‘and in his Torah he meditates day and night’” (Kiddushin 32a). The paradox holds: Torah remains God’s gift even as it becomes one’s possession.

Second, the verb for study, יֶהְגֶּה (yeh-GEH), is bodily. Brown–Driver–Briggs glosses it as “moan, growl, utter, muse.” It is the sound of low recitation, the lips moving; Joshua 1:8 uses the same verb for the daily discipline that keeps the covenantal way. The ancient Greek translators chose μελετᾶν—“to practice, rehearse”—a word that captures both rumination and repetition. Torah here is not an occasional reading; it is a habit that lodges in the mouth and reshapes the mind.

The poem’s center is not an argument but a scene: a tree “transplanted by channels of water” (וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם, wə-hā-YĀH kə-ʿĒTS shā-THŪL ʿal-pal-ghēy-MĀ-yim). BDB notes that שָׁתוּל (shā-THŪL) is the passive participle of שָׁתַל, “to transplant.” This is horticulture, not happenstance. And פַלְגֵי־מָיִם (pal-ghēy-MĀ-yim) are divided runnels—irrigation channels. The image is agricultural realism: a tree secured by design to a reliable source, yielding fruit “in its season,” with leaves that do not wither (v. 3). Jeremiah 17:8 repeats the picture almost verbatim; Ezekiel 47:12 uses it to figure a restored world. Rashi, in a wry expansion, says even the leaves of such a tree serve a purpose; even the casual talk of scholars is worth listening to.

If the righteous are rooted, the wicked are weightless. “Not so the wicked!” (לֹא־כֵן הָרְשָׁעִים). They are “like chaff that the wind drives away” (כַּמֹּץ אֲשֶׁר־תִּדְּפֶנּוּ רוּחַ, kam-MŌTS ’ăsher-tid-FEN-nū RŪ-aḥ). The metaphor is an ancient cliché because it is a perennial truth: worthless husk blown off the threshing floor. Elsewhere the psalmists deploy it as a wish against enemies (Psalms 35:5; 83:14); Isaiah (41:2) uses it to describe empires swept away. The choice of verb—נָדַף, “to drive, scatter”—adds force. The contrast is not only moral; it is physical. A rooted organism versus a husk in a gust.

The ending tightens the argument. Verse 5 speaks in courtroom terms. The wicked “will not stand” (לֹא־יָקֻמוּ, lō’-yā-QU-mū) in the judgment; “sinners” will not enter “the assembly of the righteous” (בַּעֲדַת צַדִּיקִים). This is deliberate irony. The poem had warned us against “standing” (עָמָד, ʿā-MĀDH) in the path of sinners; now the wicked cannot stand at all—least of all where it truly matters. Malbim sharpens the distinction the poem suggests: “wicked” (רְשָׁעִים, hardened rebels) are excluded even individually; “sinners” (חַטָּאִים, those who miss) might plead weakness before God but still find no place among the righteous community.

The conclusion, “For YHWH knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish” (כִּי־יוֹדֵעַ יְהוָה דֶּרֶךְ צַדִּיקִים וְדֶרֶךְ רְשָׁעִים תֹּאבֵד), is a compact theology. In Hebrew, “to know” (יֹודֵעַ, yō-DHĒ-aʿ) often means to care for, to acknowledge with favor (cf. Psalm 144:3; Hosea 13:5). God’s knowing is not mere awareness; it is sustaining attention. Notice, too, that it is “the way” that perishes (תֹּאבֵד, tō-VĒDH), not simply the wicked themselves. The path collapses under its own weightlessness. Wisdom literature repeats this insight with relentless simplicity: there are ways of living that are, in their very structure, unsustainable (see Proverbs 4:19; Jeremiah 12:1).

A few literary features repay lingering over. Verse 1 uses anaphora (repetition at the head of phrases) to create pulse: לֹא (LŌ’) … לֹא … לֹא. Read aloud, the three negatives strike with the accentual rhythm characteristic of biblical verse (poets balance stresses rather than syllable counts). The whole psalm is framed by דֶּרֶךְ (“way”): implied in v. 1, explicit twice in v. 6—an inclusio, a bracket that signals coherence. And at the editorial level, Psalms 1 and 2 form a carefully designed gateway. Psalm 1 opens with אַשְׁרֵי (“happy”); Psalm 2 closes with the same word: אַשְׁרֵי כָּל־חֹוסֵי בוֹ (“happy are all who take refuge in Him,” 2:12). The pair sets Torah meditation (Psalm 1) alongside the tumult of history under divine rule (Psalm 2)—private habit beside public drama.

Finally, the Septuagint (LXX), the ancient Greek version, both confirms and colors our reading. It renders תּוֹרָה as νόμος (law), plants the student in the same practice (μελετᾷ ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτός), and translates “seat of scoffers” (מוֹשַׁב לֵצִים) as καθέδρα λοιμῶν, “seat of pestilent men”—a vivid choice that treats scoffing as contagious rot. The LXX’s voice is not decisive, but it is a second witness from antiquity: Psalm 1 was always heard as instruction and enacted habit, not merely inspiration.

Psalm 1, then, is not a whisper of private piety. It is a grammar for reading the book it opens and, by extension, a map for reading a life: roads you choose, words you chew, where you plant yourself, and what becomes of you.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

#### Full psalm
On Yom Kippur night, many communities recite Psalm 1 in full before Maariv as part of a threshold sequence of psalms. In Edot HaMizrach practice it often opens a chain (Psalms 1–3, 24) before the formal service. The Day of Atonement begins by placing the worshiper on Psalm 1’s forked road: “אַשְׁרֵי הָאִישׁ … כִּי אִם בְּתוֹרַת יְ־הוָה חֶפְצוֹ” (“Happy the person… but his delight is in the Torah of YHWH”), a liturgical way of saying that repentance is a return to the right path.

#### Key verses
1:3 “וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם … וְכֹל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ / He is like a tree transplanted by channels of water … and all he does prospers.”
- Tefillat Geshem (Prayer for Rain), Mussaf of Shemini Atzeret. The piyyut includes: “בֵּרַכְתּו כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל פַּלְגֵי מַיִם” (Bless him like a tree planted by streams of water), tying Psalm 1’s irrigation image to the season’s plea for rain. Theologically, the verse grounds the community’s dependence on God’s steady provision, not luck.

#### Phrases
1:1 “בַּעֲצַת רְשָׁעִים / the counsel of the wicked.”
- Simchat Torah, Hakafot (Sefard/Edot HaMizrach). A petition during the circuits prays: “וּתְזַכֵּנוּ שֶׁלֹּא נֵלֵךְ בַּעֲצַת רְשָׁעִים” (Grant us the merit not to walk in the counsel of the wicked). Jewish joy is guarded by Psalm 1’s moral vigilance: celebration without frivolity’s “seat of scoffers.”

1:3 “וְעָלֵהוּ לֹא יִבּוֹל / whose leaf does not wither.”
- Simchat Torah, Hakafot (Sefard). A string of exhortations culminates: “וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל פַּלְגֵי מַיִם … וְעָלֵהוּ לֹא יִבּוֹל,” applying the verse to the Torah-bearer: a life rooted in study and practice remains green under pressure.

In several Edot HaMizrach communities, phrases from 1:3 surface in festival Kiddush and Mussaf petitions, weaving “כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל” into the season’s hopes for blessing. Across these uses, the tradition reads Psalm 1 not as generic good advice but as liturgical realism: the righteous are cultivated, irrigated by Torah and rain; celebration is chastened by Psalm 1’s first line; and the assembly of the righteous (1:5) becomes, for a moment, the gathered congregation.
