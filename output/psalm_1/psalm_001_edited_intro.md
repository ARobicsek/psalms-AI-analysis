Psalm 1 is not a prayer. It is a threshold: an invitation to read the Psalter as a schooling in desire. Its first word, אַשְׁרֵי—“Happy,” “How fortunate”—is not a mood but a verdict. The poem offers a way of life, not a passing feeling, and it does so with the simplest of means: three negations, a delight, two images, and one final claim about God.

The opening line is a study in momentum and resistance: “אַשְׁרֵי־הָאִישׁ אֲשֶׁר לֹא הָלַךְ …; וּבְדֶרֶךְ … לֹא עָמָד; וּבְמוֹשַׁב … לֹא יָשָׁב” (“Happy the man who has not walked …; nor stood …; nor sat …”). The triple “no”—לֹא … לֹא … לֹא—forms an anaphora (a deliberate repetition at the head of lines) that pounds out a boundary. The verbs themselves stage a descent into complicity: walking suggests curiosity; standing, lingering; sitting, belonging. Ibn Ezra and Rashi already saw here a moral gradient. The three settings map the inner life onto social space: “counsel” (עֲצָה) to “way” (דֶּרֶךְ) to “seat” (מוֹשָׁב). And the three human types—רְשָׁעִים (wicked), חַטָּאִים (sinners), לֵצִים (scoffers)—end with the most corrosive. The lexicon gloss for לֵצִים is precise: the incorrigible mocker who rejects correction (cf. Proverbs 9:7–8: “מוֹכִיחַ לֵץ לֹקֵחַ לוֹ קָלוֹן … אַל־תּוֹכַח לֵץ פֶּן־יִשְׂנָאֶךָ” / “Whoever corrects a scoffer earns abuse… Do not correct a scoffer lest he hate you”). The Greek Septuagint curiously renders “seat of scoffers” as “seat of pestilences” (ἐπὶ καθέδρα λοιμῶν), an ancient misapprehension that, if nothing else, reminds us how decisive the Hebrew nuance is.

The turn from negation to desire is abrupt and decisive: “כִּי אִם־בְּתוֹרַת יְהוָה חֶפְצוֹ” (“but rather, his delight is in the teaching of YHWH”). חֵפֶץ is not duty but appetite. The psalm depicts Torah not as an obligation to endure but as a pleasure to savor. And it specifies the practice: “וּבְתוֹרָתוֹ יֶהְגֶּה יוֹמָם וָלָיְלָה” (“and on his Torah he meditates, day and night”). הָגָה means to murmur—of lions that “growl” (Isaiah 31:4, “כַּאֲשֶׁר יֶהְגֶּה הָאַרְיֵה”) and of students who read aloud. It is the same verb in Joshua 1:8: “לֹא־יָמוּשׁ … מִפִּיךָ; וְהָגִיתָ בּוֹ יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה” (“This book… shall not depart from your mouth; you shall meditate on it day and night”). The phrase “day and night” is a merism, a figure that names two poles to suggest the whole (as in “heaven and earth”). And a small grammatical shift carries a large theology: from “תּוֹרַת יְהוָה” (“the LORD’s Torah”) to “בְּתוֹרָתוֹ” (“his Torah”). The Talmud hears a promise: “At first it is called ‘the LORD’s Torah’; after one has labored in it, it is called ‘his Torah’” (Avodah Zarah 19a). Delight leads to ownership; murmuring becomes indwelling.

The images that follow are elemental. The righteous one is “כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם” (“like a tree planted beside channels of water”). שָׁתוּל is a passive participle: a tree not self-sown but transplanted, set there by a gardener. The “channels” (פַּלְגֵי) are divided runnels—irrigation. The result is stability with timing: “אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ; וְעָלֵהוּ לֹא יִבּוֹל; וְכֹל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ” (“It yields its fruit in its season; its leaf does not wither; whatever it does prospers”). Jeremiah borrows the image: “וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־מַיִם… וְלֹא יִדְאָג בִּשְׁנַת בַּצֹּרֶת” (“He shall be like a tree planted by water… he shall not worry in a year of drought,” Jeremiah 17:8). Within the Psalter, Psalm 92 completes the picture: “שְׁתוּלִים בְּבֵית יְהוָה… צַדִּיק כַּתָּמָר יִפְרָח” (“Planted in the house of YHWH… the righteous shall flourish like the palm,” 92:14, 13). Psalm 1 hints; Psalm 92 locates: the streams are, ultimately, the Temple precincts—and by extension, the flow of God’s teaching.

Then, as if to demonstrate how insubstantial the alternative is, the wicked receive half a line: “לֹא־כֵן הָרְשָׁעִים; כִּי אִם כַּמֹּץ אֲשֶׁר־תִּדְּפֶנּוּ רוּחַ” (“Not so the wicked; rather, like chaff which the wind drives away”). The brevity performs the point. Chaff (מֹץ) is threshing-floor waste. Isaiah says, “כְּמֹץ הָרִים לִפְנֵי־רוּחַ” (“like chaff of the mountains before the wind,” 17:13), and a psalm prays, “יִהְיוּ כְּמֹץ לִפְנֵי־רוּחַ” (“let them be like chaff before the wind,” Psalm 35:5). The site, the threshing floor, is a place of judgment; the image is the least “rooted” thing the agrarian imagination can summon.

Verses 5–6 gather the implications in the concrete idiom of the court and the congregation: “עַל־כֵּן לֹא־יָקֻמוּ רְשָׁעִים בַּמִּשְׁפָּט; וְחַטָּאִים בַּעֲדַת צַדִּיקִים” (“Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment; nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous”). “Stand” here is legal: “עַל־פִּי שְׁנֵי עֵדִים… יָקוּם דָּבָר” (“on the testimony of two witnesses a matter shall stand,” Deuteronomy 19:15). The “assembly” (עֵדָה) is the gathered people; elsewhere it is the “great congregation” of worship (Psalm 22:26). The tradition at times hears more: an eschatological exclusion (“Therefore wicked men shall not rise up in the Judgment,” Radak), even debates whether the wicked “stand” at all (Sanhedrin 107b).

The psalm’s final stroke is both gentle and radical: “כִּי־יוֹדֵעַ יְהוָה דֶּרֶךְ צַדִּיקִים; וְדֶרֶךְ רְשָׁעִים תֹּאבֵד” (“For YHWH knows the way of the righteous; but the way of the wicked will perish”). To “know” (יָדַע) in covenant speech is not to possess information; it is to recognize and attach. “רַק אֶתְכֶם יָדַעְתִּי” (“You only have I known,” Amos 3:2); “כִּי יְדַעְתִּיו” (“For I have known him,” Genesis 18:19). God’s knowledge confers stability. The grammar tells: the righteous “way” is the object of God’s active knowing; the wicked “way” perishes (אבד) without an agent. It evaporates. As Malbim puts it, what God “knows” is what endures.

Two final literary touches matter. First, “way” (דֶּרֶךְ) frames the poem (v. 1, v. 6): an inclusio (an envelope structure) that tells you where to look. Second, the verb הָגָה links Psalm 1 and Psalm 2. Here, “he meditates” (יֶהְגֶּה) on Torah; there, “the nations plot” (וְיֶהְגּוּ) vanity (Psalm 2:1: “לָמָּה רָגְשׁוּ גוֹיִם… וְיֶהְגּוּ רִיק”). Two meditations. Two outcomes. The Psalter begins by asking you to choose your murmur.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

#### Full psalm

Many communities recite the entire psalm at the opening of Yom Kippur night (Ma’ariv). In Edot HaMizrach, Psalm 1 begins a sequence (Psalms 1–4, 24) with a “יְהִי רָצוֹן” between sections, situating the Day of Atonement within the psalm’s stark choice of “ways.” Several Ashkenazic rites likewise place Psalm 1 before devotional pieces such as “Shir HaYichud” and “Anim Zemirot.” Its placement on the holiest night underscores the tradition’s reading: judgment (בַּמִּשְׁפָּט), assembly (עֲדָת צַדִּיקִים), and divine “knowing” (יוֹדֵעַ) are not abstractions but liturgical realities.

#### Key verses

Psalm 1:2 — “כִּי אִם־בְּתוֹרַת יְהוָה חֶפְצוֹ; וּבְתוֹרָתוֹ יֶהְגֶּה יוֹמָם וָלָיְלָה.” (“Rather, his delight is in the teaching of the LORD; and on his teaching he meditates day and night.”) Rabbinic tradition seizes on the shift from “תּוֹרַת יְהוָה” to “תּוֹרָתוֹ”: “בתחילה היא נקראת תורת ה׳, ומשעמל בה היא נקראת תורתו” (“At first it is called the LORD’s Torah; after he has toiled in it, it is called his,” Avodah Zarah 19a). This line underwrites the ideal of constant Torah study, especially emphasized in penitential seasons.

Psalm 1:3 — “וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי מָיִם…” (“He shall be like a tree planted by streams of water…”) In many Edot HaMizrach communities, this verse is woven into the Rosh Hashanah night Kiddush after the plea “אָנָּא ה׳ הַצְלִיחָה נָא” (“Please, LORD, grant success”), functioning as a prooftext for blessing in the new year. In the Tefillat Geshem (Prayer for Rain) on Shemini Atzeret, the chazzan invokes: “זְכוֹר אָב נִמְשַׁךְ אַחֲרֶיךָ כַּמַּיִם; בֵּרַכְתּוֹ כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל פַּלְגֵי מַיִם” (“Remember the father drawn after You like waters; You blessed him like a tree planted by streams of water”), transposing Psalm 1’s personal flourishing into a communal prayer for rain.

#### Phrases

Psalm 1:1 — “וּבְמוֹשַׁב לֵצִים לֹא יָשָׁב” (“nor sat in the seat of scoffers”). In the Shabbat afternoon study of Pirkei Avot, the dictum is recited: “שֶׁיּוֹשְׁבִין וְאֵין בֵּינֵיהֶם דִּבְרֵי תוֹרָה, הֲרֵי זֶה מוֹשַׁב לֵצִים, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: וּבְמוֹשַׁב לֵצִים לֹא יָשָׁב” (“If people sit together and there are no words of Torah between them, this is a seat of scoffers, as it is said: ‘nor sat in the seat of scoffers’”). The verse becomes an ethic of conversation: Torah talk is not ornament but safeguard.

Psalm 1:3 — “כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי מָיִם.” As part of Simchat Torah Hakafot in some Sefardic rites, this phrase appears in sequences of verses and piyyutim praising Torah; the image of rooted, fruiting life is appropriated as a portrait of the community circling the scrolls.
