Psalm 1 is less a preface than a threshold. Cross it, and you have already been taught how to read the songs that follow. The psalm sketches two paths in six verses—the righteous, whose life is rooted in Torah, and the wicked, who are as weightless as chaff—then leaves the reader with a sentence that feels like a judicial verdict (v. 6). The poet’s art is laconic and exacting. It is not a lecture in ethics, but a poem that instructs by form as much as by statement.

The opening beatitude, אַשְׁרֵי הָאִישׁ (“Happy” or “How fortunate the person”), is plural in Hebrew—literally, “felicities.” Medievals noticed the plural (Radak: “one does not call a person happy for a single good, but for many”), and the point stands: Psalm 1 is not about flashes of luck but a durable state. That durability is defined at first by refusal. Verse 1 builds by anaphora (repetition at a line’s start) and by a “staircase” of verbs: “has not walked … nor stood … nor sat.” The negatives—לֹא … לֹא … לֹא—strike like fence posts. The company likewise escalates: “the wicked … sinners … scoffers.” Ancient Jewish readers already heard in this a compressed moral psychology: casual contact hardens into stance, stance into seat. Ibn Ezra contrasts the terms: “wicked” are morally unstable, “sinners” are those who commit the deed, “scoffers” corrode the moral world with mockery. The Greek translators rendered the last term as “λοιμῶν”—pestilent persons; scorn is a social disease.

The turn in verse 2 is the hinge of the psalm: “but rather, in the Torah of YHWH is his delight, and in his Torah he meditates day and night.” The noun חֵפֶץ is desire, not mere duty; it can be erotic (cf. Gen 34:19). The verb הָגָה, as the standard lexica note, means “to mutter, murmur”—the sound of text on the lips. That is how ancient reading worked; it is also how Torah penetrates the self. The second colon’s possessive (“in his Torah”) prompted a rabbinic insight (Avodah Zarah 19a): “At first it is called ‘Torah of YHWH’; after one has labored in it, it is called ‘his Torah.’” The psalm hints at this interiorization by its own syntax.

The tree image that follows is not generic pastoral. The righteous is “like a tree שָׁתוּל (transplanted) by channels of water” (פַלְגֵי־מַיִם). The choice of שָׁתוּל matters: this is not random sprouting, but intentional placement in an optimal site—exactly the work of the cultivator. The “channels” are irrigation runs, not a wild river. In other words, the psalm makes flourishing a consequence of practices: the discipline of Torah recitation shapes a life the way a careful farmer shapes a plot. Elsewhere biblical poets use related imagery (Jer 17:8: “like a tree planted by water”; Ps 92:13-15: trees thriving in God’s courts), but here the agricultural specificity is striking. This is not a cosmic tree; this is an orchard.

The contrast is as spare as the tree is lush: “Not so the wicked—like chaff that the wind drives away” (v. 4). Chaff (מֹץ) is the light debris of threshing, the non-food, the flotsam. The image is a stock one for judgment (Ps 35:5; Job 21:18; Isa 17:13), but the poet’s brevity is an argument: evil is insubstantial; it does not merit narrative. Readers sometimes ask whether “wind” (רוּחַ) might carry a hint of the divine Spirit; perhaps—but the point is not the force but the weightlessness of what it scatters.

Verses 5–6 move from farm to court. “Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous” (v. 5). “Stand” is a legal idiom: to “stand” is to be upheld, to be established (cf. Deut 19:15, “a matter shall stand” = be valid). The line also quietly echoes v. 1: the person who did not “stand” in the path of sinners will “stand” when it matters; the wicked, who did stand in that path, will not. The phrase “assembly of the righteous” (בַּעֲדַת צַדִּיקִים) borrows the Torah’s word for Israel’s gathered community (עֵדָה), and the Greek (“βουλῇ δικαίων,” counsel of the righteous) intentionally circles back to v. 1’s “counsel of the wicked,” closing the poem’s frame.

The finale, verse 6, is wonderfully asymmetrical: “For YHWH knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked shall perish.” “Knows” in biblical Hebrew is covenantal—God’s attentive, electing recognition (Gen 18:19: “I have known/acknowledged Abraham”; Amos 3:2: “You only have I known”). Evil, by contrast, needs no agent; it collapses of its own contradictions. The poem therefore avoids a naïve calculus of reward-and-punishment; its claim is about reality’s structure. To delight in Torah is to be placed—transplanted—next to sources that make life fruitful “in its season.” To dismiss the moral order is to become, eventually, something the wind does not need to fight to remove.

This opening psalm also sets up tensions the Psalter will explore. “Whatever he does prospers” (v. 3) is true enough to orient the prayer book; it is not always true this afternoon. The laments and pleas that follow treat Psalm 1 less as guarantee than as north star. It remains the Psalter’s quiet, programmatic audacity: let this be your habit—mouth and mind set to Torah, sustained over days and nights—and see what sort of life it grows.

- Anaphora: the repetition of a word at successive line openings (here, לֹא).
- Merism: naming two poles to imply the whole (e.g., “day and night” = all the time).

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

#### Full psalm

In both Ashkenazi and Edot HaMizrach rites, many communities recite Psalm 1 at the outset of Yom Kippur night (Maariv), often as part of a chain (Pss 1–4; in some Edot HaMizrach traditions, followed by Ps 24 and a יהי רצון). Beginning the Day of Atonement with “אַשְׁרֵי הָאִישׁ” (Happy the one) frames the fast with Psalm 1’s “two ways” and its call to Torah-formed desire: “כִּי אִם בְּתוֹרַת ה׳ חֶפְצוֹ… יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה.”

#### Key verses

Psalm 1:3 — “וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם… וְכֹל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ / He is like a tree transplanted by channels of water… all he does prospers.” In the Rosh Hashanah night Kiddush (Edot HaMizrach), poetic introductions quote the verse verbatim: “וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי מַיִם… וְכָל אֲשֶׁר יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ,” turning the psalm’s horticultural promise into a communal benediction for the year.

#### Phrases

- Psalm 1:1a — “בַּעֲצַת רְשָׁעִים / in the counsel of the wicked.” In Simḥat Torah hakafot (Sephardi), a petition reads: “וּתְזַכֵּנוּ שֶׁלֹּא נֵלֵךְ בַּעֲצַת רְשָׁעִים,” making Psalm 1’s negative template an ethical guardrail during the Torah’s festive circuit.

- Psalm 1:3a — “כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם / like a tree transplanted by streams of water.” In Tefillat Geshem (Shemini Atzeret), the piyyut recalls the patriarchs and prays for rain: “בֵּרַכְתּוֹ כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל פַּלְגֵי מַיִם,” yoking Psalm 1’s irrigation image to Israel’s agricultural dependence and divine provision.

- Psalm 1:1c — “וּבְמוֹשַׁב לֵצִים לֹא יָשָׁב / in the seat of scoffers he did not sit.” In the Pirkei Avot study rubric (as printed in many siddurim), gatherings without words of Torah are labeled “מוֹשַׁב לֵצִים… שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: וּבְמוֹשַׁב לֵצִים לֹא יָשָׁב,” while Torah-centered fellowship is said to host the Shekhinah. In some versions, Psalm 1:3 buttresses a teaching on moral steadfastness: “כָּל הָרוּחוֹת… אֵין מְזִיזִין אוֹתוֹ… שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל…”

Liturgical use confirms how Jewish tradition has read the psalm: as a rule for life (“Do not walk… stand… sit”), a pedagogy of desire (Torah murmured “day and night”), and a blessing prayed over the community’s seasons.
