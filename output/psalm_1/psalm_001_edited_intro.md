The editors of the Psalter begin not with a song of rescue but with a lesson in orientation. Psalm 1 is a wisdom poem that sets the compass: there are two ways to travel through the world. One leads to rootedness and fruit; the other blows away like dust. Read after this psalm, the lament and praise that follow become part of a larger schooling—how to live before God when joy is abundant or when joy runs out.

The opening word, אַשְׁרֵי, is both promise and posture. The phrase “אַשְׁרֵי הָאִישׁ”—“Happy is the man”—enters the Greek Bible as μακάριος ἀνήρ (makarios anēr), a cadence that will echo in later beatitudes. The Hebrew, though, is more than a headline. Medieval readers noted that אַשְׁרֵי is plural in form; Radak glossed: happiness is never a single windfall but a gathering of good. The psalm proceeds to specify that “gathering” not as luck but as a disciplined avoidance of bad company and a cultivated love for instruction.

The first line runs on three negations: “has not walked… has not stood… has not sat” (`**LŌ'** hā-**LAKH** … **LŌ'** ʿā-**MĀDH** … **LŌ'** yā-**SHĀV**`). Three “no’s” in a row make an anaphora (a deliberate repetition at the start of lines), and the sibilants in “מוֹשַׁב… יָשַׁב” (mōshav… yashav) bind the last two. The point is not pedantry but progression: in biblical idiom to “walk” a “way” means to adopt a manner of life (Deut 8:6; 10:12; 19:9). To “stand” can mean to hold one’s ground, especially in court (compare Deut 19:15: “A single witness shall not stand [לֹא יָקוּם] to establish a case”). To “sit” signals belonging: you’ve taken a seat, joined the circle. The nouns escalate too: “wicked” (רְשָׁעִים), the broad biblical term for those set against God’s order; “sinners” (חַטָּאִים), those who miss the mark; and “scoffers” (לֵצִים), the incorrigible mockers of Proverbs who treat correction as a joke. The Septuagint renders לֵצִים as λοιμοί (“pestilent ones”), shifting the emphasis from mockery to social contagion—moral derision as a public health hazard. Either way, the psalm begins with the sociology of character: the people you walk with train your gait.

Then comes the pivot: “but rather” (`**KIY** 'im-`)—a reversal in grammar and path. The blessed person delights in “the Torah of YHWH” and “meditates” on it “day and night.” The key verb, יֶהְגֶּה (`yeh-**GEH**`), is tactile: to murmur, to growl, to keep words in the mouth until they flavor the mind. When Joshua is told “וְהָגִיתָ בּוֹ יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה” (“meditate on it day and night,” Josh 1:8), a habit is prescribed: recitation becoming rumination. Here, the poem moves from “תּוֹרַת יְהוָה” (“the teaching of YHWH”) to “וּבְתוֹרָתוֹ” (“in his teaching”); the sages loved that turn. Rashi cites the rabbinic gloss (Avodah Zarah 19a): at first it is God’s Torah; through toil it becomes yours. The merism “day and night” (naming two poles to mean the whole) signals not an hour count but a through-line: this is what your mind returns to.

The heart of the psalm is horticulture. “He is like a tree planted (`shā-**THŪL**`) by channels of water (`pal-ghēy-**MĀ**-yim`).” The participle שָׁתוּל means transplanted—set in a chosen place (Jer 17:8; Ezek 19:10; Ps 92:14). The site is irrigated: פַלְגֵי מַיִם are divided runnels, not a single river. This is cultivation as much as nature. The three clauses that follow are compact and sensuous: “gives its fruit in season,” “its leaf does not wither,” “whatever he does prospers.” BDB notes יִבּוֹל (“withers,” from נָבֵל) is used for leaves and for moral collapse; here its negation is botanical and ethical stamina. The last line—“כֹּל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ”—feels absolute. Readers as early as the Talmud pressed it into daily life with audacity (Ketubbot 62b: “This is one who fulfills marital ‘season’ on the eve of Sabbath”), while others noticed that the Psalter itself will complicate the claim. Psalm 73 looks squarely at prosperous wickedness. The wisdom of Psalm 1 is not a vending machine. It describes the long arc of a life rooted by a reliable water source; the time-scale is “in season.”

The wicked receive only a sketch: “Not so… but like chaff the wind drives away” (כַּמֹּץ אֲשֶׁר־תִּדְּפֶנּוּ רוּחַ). Chaff is threshing-floor waste—light, good for nothing, at the mercy of a breeze (Ps 35:5; 83:14; Isa 17:13). The asymmetry is deliberate; there is less to say about insubstantiality. The legal turn in vv. 5–6 completes the moral geography. “Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment” (עַל־כֵן לֹא־יָקֻמוּ רְשָׁעִים בַּמִּשְׁפָּט). Again the verb “stand” carries forensic weight: Deuteronomy uses יָקוּם for the validation of testimony (19:15). To “stand in judgment” is to be vindicated; they will not. Nor will “sinners stand in the assembly of the righteous” (בַּעֲדַת צַדִּיקִים). עֵדָה is the technical word for an appointed congregation; here it marks belonging—who counts as part of the enduring people.

The final couplet states, with lapidary clarity, the antithesis the poem has been building: “For YHWH knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked perishes.” To “know” (יָדַע) in Hebrew often exceeds cognition: “I have known you by name,” God tells Moses (Exod 33:12); “I knew you in the wilderness,” the prophet says for God (Hos 13:5). It is elective regard, watchful care. The line is as compact a theology as the Bible offers: the path aligned with God’s instruction is kept in God’s knowledge; the other path, by its own design, unravels.

Two features sharpen this architecture. First, the psalm is framed by “way” (דֶּרֶךְ) in v. 1 and v. 6—an inclusio, a matching phrase at start and finish that marks a unit and its theme. Second, early Jewish tradition paired Psalm 1 with Psalm 2 (see b. Berakhot 9b): together, they stretch from “Torah” in the quiet mind to “nations” in public tumult. Read in tandem, they teach that meditation and politics are not separate compartments but adjoining rooms.

Comparative literature does help. Egyptian and Mesopotamian instruction texts do speak of two paths and of a righteous life. What is distinctive here is not the binary but the source: delight is anchored to Torah—the particular instruction of Israel’s God—not to royal etiquette or pragmatic shrewdness. And the figure is not a sage in a court but an ordinary person placed like a tree by hand.

Technical notes for the curious:
- “Colon” refers to a single line (or half-line) of verse; biblical poetry builds meaning by the relation between cola.
- “Antithetic parallelism” is when the second colon sets an opposite against the first (“A is so, but B”); Psalm 1:6 is a classic instance.
- “Inclusio” is the bracketing of a unit with a repeated word or phrase (“way” in vv. 1 and 6).
- “MT” denotes the Masoretic Text, the standard medieval Hebrew tradition; “LXX” is the Septuagint, the ancient Greek translation; “BDB” is the Brown–Driver–Briggs Hebrew lexicon.

The effect of Psalm 1 is to reorient the reader: before we learn to cry out or to rejoice, we are taught where to put our roots. The Psalter opens not with a mood but with a planting.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

Psalm 1 is not part of the fixed daily or Shabbat cycle as a whole, but its language threads through Jewish prayer. The beatitude formula אַשְׁרֵי stands behind the prayer popularly called “Ashrei” (recited daily at Shacharit and Mincha), whose refrain is Psalm 145 but is framed by beatitude verses (Ps 84:5; 144:15). The prominence of אַשְׁרֵי as a liturgical word of blessed orientation gives Psalm 1’s opening line wide resonance.

Verse 2’s “יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה” (“day and night”) shapes the morning blessings over Torah (Birkhot HaTorah). After those blessings, many rites include a short anthology of texts on learning Torah that features Joshua 1:8 (“וְהָגִיתָ בּוֹ יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה”), whose language mirrors Psalm 1:2’s “וּבְתוֹרָתוֹ יֶהְגֶּה יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה.” The pairing makes explicit what Psalm 1 implies: a life ordered by regular, audible study.

The tree image of v. 3 has colored piyyut (liturgical poetry) and communal blessings that pray for “planting” and prosperity, especially in communities that emphasize Torah learning as the heart of communal flourishing. In short, Jewish liturgy receives Psalm 1 as a doorway: blessedness is a practiced orientation—resisting corrosive company, taking delight in the words that make a people—and prayer assumes that orientation as its daily ground.
