Two paths open the Psalter. One leads under shade—the cool, irrigated ground where a transplanted tree puts down roots. The other is a threshing floor, a swirled haze of husks that do not last. Psalm 1 is not merely first; it is a doorknob. It tells you how to enter the book and what to look for once inside.

The poem’s architecture is simple and exact. A three‑part refusal—“does not walk… does not stand… does not sit”—is followed by a single desire: “his delight is in the teaching (`torah`) of the LORD.” A sustained simile develops the consequence: a well-sited tree whose fruit comes “in its season.” Then the turn: “Not so the wicked,” who are like chaff in a sudden wind. The closing couplet sets the two ways side by side: the LORD “knows” the way of the righteous; the wicked way “perishes.”

Several literary devices deserve names, if only to help us see them. The psalm opens with an anaphora (repetition at the start of clauses): three `lo’ (“not”) clauses in a row. The final verse is antithetic parallelism—one line set against its opposite. The poem is framed by inclusio—“way” (`derek`) in verse 1 and again in verse 6—forming an envelope that keeps the reader’s attention on moral direction rather than private feelings. A “colon,” incidentally, is a single poetic line; Hebrew verse often comes in paired cola whose relationship creates the meaning.

The progression—walk, stand, sit—has the tidy inevitability of habit becoming character. Classical Jewish commentators noticed the deepening involvement (Rashi; Radak). Ibn Ezra suggests a different nuance: the “wicked” (`resha‘im`) are unstable, already unmoored, making the walker easy prey to counsel that is all drift and no root. The last group, `letzim`, are not merely naughty; in Proverbs they are unteachable mockers of instruction itself (BDB). The ancient Greek translation (the LXX) renders them as λοιμῶν—“pestilent fellows,” literally “plague‑people”—a revealing shift from mockery to contagion.

If the negative is crisp, the positive is expansive. The righteous do not merely avoid; they desire. The verb `ḥefetz` denotes pleasure and want, not duty. And the meditation verb `yehgeh` does not mean silent musing. It is a murmured recitation—a voiced study that moves from lips to memory, the same verb used in Joshua 1:8, where reciting Torah “day and night” is linked to success. “Day and night” is a merism (two extremes naming a whole), a Hebrew way of saying “constantly.”

Two editorial decisions seem intentional. First, Psalm 1 pairs naturally with Psalm 2; both poems end with the word “happy” (`ashrei` 1:1; 2:12), creating an entry arch to the Psalter that is at once personal and political: devotion to God’s teaching (Psalm 1) and trust in God’s reign over arrogant powers (Psalm 2). Second, Psalm 1’s language leans toward wisdom rather than cult. The temple is not the focus; Torah is. That suits the book’s later history, when study and prayer often had to replace rites. But the psalm does not date itself. Its theological center—the “two ways”—is classically Deuteronomic: “Follow the path… that you may thrive” (Deut 5:30); “I set before you life and death” (Deut 30:15–20). The Psalm’s metaphor of “way” (`derek`) and “walking” (`halakh`) is the Bible’s long habit of turning ethics into a path underfoot.

The tree is not merely blessed; it is cultivated. The participle `shatul` means “transplanted” (BDB), the gardener’s act of re‑siting a good sapling. Its placement is beside `palgei mayim`—divided watercourses. These are channels, irrigation rills, not a single stream. In a land of seasonal rain, the difference is everything. Jeremiah 17:8, likely echoing our psalm, speaks of a tree whose root reaches out to a stream and which does not fear heat. Ezekiel 19:10 pictures a vine planted “beside abundant waters.” The point is not prosperity gospel but rootedness: fruit in the proper time and leaves that don’t wither in stress. The final line—“whatever he does prospers”—troubles modern ears. But “prosper” (`yatsliaḥ`) here is closer to “comes to good effect” than “strikes it rich.” Its nearest scriptural cousin is again Joshua 1:8: success as the outworking of obedience, not as a guarantee against suffering. Read inside the Psalter, with its laments and exiles, the promise is backbone, not insulation.

By contrast, the wicked are “like chaff which the wind drives away.” The simile is terse and cruel. Chaff (`motz`) has two properties that matter in biblical usage: it is weightless and it is waste. The figurative database confirms the pattern: chaff, almost always, is the image of enemies in judgment (Ps 35:5; Isa 17:13). Here the agent is the `ruaḥ`, wind—or spirit. The ambiguity is theological: the same word names the breeze and the breath of God. Either way, nothing holds.

The legal turn in verse 5 sharpens the destinies. “Will not stand in the judgment” uses `qum` in its juridical sense: to stand means to have your case established. Deuteronomy 19:15: “a matter will stand [`yakum`—be established] on the testimony of two witnesses.” The wicked have no standing. Nor do sinners belong in “the assembly of the righteous” (`‘adat tsaddiqim`). The noun `‘edah` can mean Israel’s congregation; here it leans eschatological—fellowship under God’s verdict. The poets’ final verb chooses relationship over surveillance: “the LORD knows (`yada‘`) the way of the righteous.” In biblical idiom this knowing is intimate and covenantal: “I have known Abraham” (Gen 18:19); “You only have I known” (Amos 3:2). The opposite fate needs no actor. The wicked way “perishes.” Rot is what happens when something has no root in the real.

A word on reception. Rabbinic tradition loved the small hinge in verse 2: “the teaching of the LORD… and on his teaching.” “At first,” says Avodah Zarah 19a, “it is called God’s Torah; after one labors in it, it becomes his.” The Talmud even uses our verse in a wry legal debate (Kiddushin 32a) about whether a teacher can forgo honor: is Torah “his”? Elsewhere the rabbis hear in “its fruit in its season” a humane rhythm for scholars’ lives, down to domestic obligations (Ketubot 62b). One need not follow the halakhic byways to feel the larger point: Psalm 1 imagines devotion as something that becomes your voice, your mind, your rootedness—your way.
