PART 1: Main Introduction Essay (about 1100 words)

Psalm 1 does not so much introduce the Psalter as instruct us how to read it. It teaches us to see prayer, lament, thanksgiving, and royal hope through the old, stubborn wisdom contrast of “two ways.” The psalm’s brevity is deceptive. Its metaphors are concrete, its syntax taut, and its argument unfolds in the interplay of lines—a hallmark of biblical poetry, which advances thought by parallel cola (a “colon” is a single poetic line) that confirm, sharpen, or oppose one another.

The opening beatitude, אַשְׁרֵי־הָאִישׁ (`'ash-RĒY hā-'IYSH`)—“Happy/blessed is the person”—is a plural noun (אַשְׁרֵי) that, as Radak notes, suggests a fullness of goods; happiness is never a single stroke of luck but a composite life. The psalm begins by drawing a silhouette: the righteous is first described by what he declines to do. Three short clauses form a staircase of refusal: “who has not walked in the counsel of the wicked, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of scoffers” (v. 1). The verbs “walked/stood/sat” (הָלַךְ/עָמַד/יָשַׁב) trace a movement from casual exposure to rooted belonging. The three groups—רְשָׁעִים (rə-shā‘īm, “the wicked”), חַטָּאִים (ḥaṭṭā’īm, “sinners”), and לֵצִים (lētsīm, “scoffers”)—span active malice, habitual failure, and corrosive cynicism. BDB remarks that the lēts, the “scoffer,” delights in scorning and resists correction; the Septuagint’s choice of λοιμοί (“pestilent ones”) widens the damage from private vice to public contagion.

Even the sound underscores the stance. With the repetition of the emphatic לֹא (lo, “not”)—“לֹא הָלַךְ … לֹא עָמָד … לֹא יָשָׁב”—the Hebrew makes negation a beat. In the provided phonetic line, each לֹא bears the stress (`LŌ' … LŌ' … LŌ'`), giving the refusal a drum-like cadence. The first wisdom lesson is restraint: flourishing here depends as much on what one declines as on what one desires.

The pivot comes with כִּי אִם (ki 'im, “but rather,” v. 2), an adversative that ushers in a positive posture: “his delight is in the Torah of YHWH, and in his Torah he meditates day and night.” “Torah” (תוֹרָה, tôrāh) means instruction—divine teaching—more than “law code.” The subtle shift from “the Torah of YHWH” (בְּתוֹרַת יְהוָה) to “his Torah” (וּבְתוֹרָתוֹ) received a famous gloss in Rashi: what begins as God’s instruction becomes “his” through toil; teaching internalized becomes a life. The verb יֶהְגֶּה (`yeh-GEH`) is onomatopoetic: to mutter, muse, murmur. The psalm does not picture silent reading but audible rumination, lips moving—and not sporadically, but “day and night,” a merism (naming two poles to evoke the whole) for steady habit. This is the wisdom answer to the negative company of v. 1: the righteous seats himself under teaching.

From habit to image: “He will be like a tree transplanted beside channels of water” (וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַלְגֵי־מָיִם, v. 3). “Transplanted” (שָׁתוּל, shātûl) matters; BDB glosses the root as “to transplant.” This tree did not chance upon a stream; it was set by design. The “channels” (פַלְגֵי, palgēy) are divided runnels—agricultural irrigation, not a romantic brook. In other words, this is cultivation as much as nature, a figure for a life intentionally positioned under steady nourishment. The fruit arrives “in its season” (בְּעִתּוֹ), which rescues the verse from naïveté: this is not a promise of perpetual harvest but of reliable rhythms. Even the leaves “do not wither” (לֹא־יִבּוֹל), a touch the rabbis read with some whimsy: even a scholar’s casual talk proves useful (Rashi). 

The image reverberates across Israel’s Scriptures. Jeremiah 17:7–8 borrows the tree-by-water figure but emphasizes drought-proof trust; Psalm 1 stresses placement by channels and seasonal fruitfulness. The figurative database confirms how pervasive such arboreal metaphors are for stability and nourishment; here they are sharpened by the agricultural specificity.

The wicked receive less ink but not less force: “Not so the wicked! Rather, they are like chaff that the wind drives away” (v. 4). Chaff (מֹּץ, mots) is the fine, worthless husk separated on a threshing floor. The verb נָדַף (nadaph, “drive away”) suggests violent dispersal. The Bible’s imagination reaches for this picture whenever it wants to render enemies or evildoers insubstantial (Psalms 35:5; Isaiah 41:2). The psalm’s own rhetoric enacts this weightlessness: where the righteous gets an extended, layered simile, the wicked vanish in a single gust. Brevity is meaning.

From image to verdict, the psalm turns juridical: “Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous” (v. 5). The verb “stand” (קוּם, qum) in judicial contexts means “endure” or “hold one’s ground.” There is dark wit here: the righteous refused to “stand” in the way of sinners (v. 1); now the wicked cannot “stand” when judgment turns its face upon them. The “assembly” (עֲדַת, ‘ădat) of the righteous is a gathered company “by appointment” (BDB), a community of belonging that sinners cannot inhabit. The rabbis took such phrases with eschatological seriousness and practical bite: Torah Temimah cites debates about who rises in judgment and who belongs among the righteous—this psalm was not read as moral wallpaper but as a chart of ultimate belonging.

The last line states the theology that underwrites all the imagery: “For YHWH knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish” (v. 6). “Knows” (יוֹדֵעַ, yôdēa‘) in biblical idiom reaches beyond awareness to covenant regard—recognition that entails care (Radak glosses: “recognizes and attends, to do them good”). The psalm’s form here is antithetic parallelism (a device in which the second colon opposes the first): what God “knows,” endures; what God does not “know” perishes. Note the inclusio (envelope): the poem begins with “way” (דֶּרֶךְ, derekh, v. 1) and ends with “way” (v. 6), bracketing the whole with the moral road one travels. Life is not a static attribute but a direction that God either tends or allows to run to ruin.

Placed at the head of the Psalter, Psalm 1 gives us an interpretive habit. It teaches us to hear the laments not as cynical but as the speech of one planted by teaching; to hear royal psalms as sorting kings into two ways; to hear thanksgiving as the fruit of seasons rather than the denial of droughts. It also tells us how instruction becomes character: delight, muttering, placement—all quotidian. The psalm insists that the “choice” between ways is not only made at crises but rendered day and night, by what counsel one keeps and by what words one speaks to oneself.

A brief word on the Greek: the Septuagint opens with μακάριος ἀνήρ (“happy the man”), and renders “seat of scoffers” as καθέδρα λοιμῶν—“seat of pestilences”—a pungent choice that turns mockery into social infection. It keeps the metaphors of tree and chaff intact and mirrors the Hebrew antithesis in v. 6 (“the way of the ungodly shall perish,” ἀπολλύω). The LXX confirms how early readers sensed the psalm’s public stakes: scoffing spreads; chaff disperses; a tended life endures.

One rabbinic coda reveals how intimately Israel read this poem. Torah Temimah, following Bavli (Ketubot 62b; Bava Kamma 82a), draws “who gives his fruit in its season” (אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ, v. 3) into the calendar of marital life, praising the rhythm of conjugal intimacy Erev Shabbat as a kind of seasonal fruit. It is an audacious, tender reading: Torah study does not eclipse embodied life but seasons it. The psalm’s metaphors bear such weight because they come from the ground and lead back to it: roots near channels; speech in the mouth; ways underfoot.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

Psalm 1 stands at thresholds in Jewish prayer, marking choice and renewal.

Full psalm (Yom Kippur Maariv). In many communities (Ashkenazi and Edot HaMizrach), the entire psalm is recited on Kol Nidrei night as a devotional preface. Its opening refusal and its closing assurance frame the Day of Atonement’s work. The sequence in some Edot HaMizrach rites proceeds through Psalms 2, 3, and 24 before Barekhu, forming a liturgical porch.

Key verse (1:3). “וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ וְעָלֵהוּ לֹא־יִבּוֹל; וְכֹל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ.” “He shall be like a tree transplanted by channels of water, which gives its fruit in its season; its leaf does not wither; and all he does prospers.” In Sefardi/Edot HaMizrach usage this appears in festival contexts, including the Mussaf Amidah of the Shalosh Regalim and in expanded Rosh Hashanah night Kiddush poems, where the petition “אָנָּא יְהוָה הוֹשִׁיעָה נָּא … וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי מַיִם” ties the psalm’s image to seasonal blessing and success.

Phrase (1:3) in Tefillat Geshem (Shemini Atzeret). The rain service incorporates the line: “בֵּרַכְתּו כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל פַּלְגֵי מַיִם” (“Bless him like a tree transplanted by streams of water”), immediately before invoking “מַשִּׁיב הָרוּחַ וּמוֹרִיד הַגֶּשֶׁם.” The imagery becomes a prayer for reliable water and, by extension, reliable life.

Phrases from 1:1 in Simchat Torah Hakafot. The processional supplication often includes: “וּתְזַכֵּנוּ שֶׁלֹּא נֵלֵךְ בַּעֲצַת רְשָׁעִים” (“Grant us not to walk in the counsel of the wicked”), echoing “בַּעֲצַת רְשָׁעִים” (v. 1). During a festival of joy, the community asks for moral ballast.

Prooftext in Pirkei Avot. The tractate cited in many Shabbat-minḥah customs teaches that conversation empty of Torah is a “seat of scoffers,” quoting: “וּבְמוֹשַׁב לֵצִים לֹא יָשָׁב” (1:1). The psalm thus polices the border between frivolity and sanctified speech. Across these placements, Psalm 1 is heard as both diagnosis and promise: Torah as irrigation channel; community as “assembly of the righteous.”
