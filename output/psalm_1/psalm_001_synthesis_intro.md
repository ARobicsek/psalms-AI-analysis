# Introduction Essay

The opening psalm of the Psalter is not a prayer, a lament, or a plea for deliverance. It is a programmatic thesis statement—a Torah wisdom piece that functions as the interpretive lens through which the entire collection is meant to be read. Psalm 1 proposes a stark binary, developed through contrastive imagery: the flourishing tree rooted beside water streams versus the weightless chaff scattered by the wind. The two paths are defined not primarily by discrete moral choices but by fundamental orientations—anchored, fruitful engagement with the תּוֹרַת ה׳ (torah YHWH, the teaching of the LORD) versus ethical drift into communities of wickedness. Yet the psalm's concluding theological assertion shifts the ground entirely, grounding this dualism not in human moral effort but in divine knowledge: כִּֽי־יוֹדֵ֣עַ ה׳ דֶּ֣רֶךְ צַדִּיקִ֑ים וְדֶ֖רֶךְ רְשָׁעִ֣ים תֹּאבֵֽד (ki yodea YHWH derekh tzadiqim, ve-derekh resha'im to'ved, "For the LORD knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish"). The psalm thus transforms from ethical instruction into an ontological claim about divine recognition and the very nature of reality.

The opening beatitude—אַשְׁרֵי־הָאִישׁ ("happy is the man")—introduces a triadic progression that has puzzled commentators. The blessed person is one אֲשֶׁר לֹא הָלַךְ בַּעֲצַת רְשָׁעִים וּבְדֶרֶךְ חַטָּאִים לֹא עָמָד וּבְמוֹשַׁב לֵצִים לֹא יָשָׁב (asher lo halakh ba'atzat resha'im u-ve-derekh chatta'im lo 'amad u-ve-moshav leitzim lo yashav, "who has not walked in the counsel of the wicked, or stood in the way of sinners, or sat in the seat of scoffers"). The threefold repetition of לֹא (lo, "not") creates an emphatic drumbeat of negation. But what do the three verbs—"walk," "stand," "sit"—signify? Ibn Ezra suggests these represent progressive stages of entanglement: first, the wandering step (הָלַךְ, halakh) toward wickedness; then, the pausing to consider (עָמָד, 'amad); finally, the settled residence (יָשָׁב, yashav) among the corrupt. Rashi, drawing on the Talmud (Avodah Zarah 18b), interprets this sequence as describing increasingly committed states of social participation in wickedness. The lexicon evidence supports this interpretation—the root ישב (y-sh-b, "to sit/dwell") often carries connotations of permanence and establishment, as in the covenantal promise of dwelling securely in the land. The three categories of the wicked—רְשָׁעִים (resha'im, "wicked"), חַטָּאִים (chatta'im, "sinners"), and לֵצִים (leitzim, "scoffers")—similarly suggest escalating alienation from God. The BDB lexicon notes that לֵצִים specifically refers to those who scorn divine truth, who are "proud and haughty" and "incapable of discipline."

The structural asymmetry between the descriptions of the righteous and the wicked is striking—and poetically deliberate. The righteous receive three full verses of elaborate, sensory imagery: כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי מָיִם אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ וְעָלֵהוּ לֹא־יִבּוֹל (ke-'eitz shatul 'al-palgei mayim asher piryo yitten be-'itto ve-'alehu lo-yivvol, "like a tree planted beside streams of water, which yields its fruit in season, whose foliage never fades"). The passive participle שָׁתוּל (shatul, "planted") is theologically significant—the righteous person is positioned by an external agent (divine, one presumes), not self-made. The concordance reveals that this imagery of transplantation appears only once elsewhere in the Psalter, in Psalm 92:14: שְׁתוּלִים בְּבֵית ה׳ בְּחַצְרוֹת אֱלֹהֵינוּ יַפְרִיחוּ (she-tulim be-veit YHWH be-chatzrot eloheinu yafrichu, "planted in the house of the LORD, they flourish in the courts of our God"). This intertextual link between the two psalms is no accident. Both employ the tree metaphor to depict righteous flourishing, but Psalm 92 makes explicit what Psalm 1 implies: the righteous are "planted" in proximity to God's dwelling. The streams of water (פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם, palgei-mayim) likely represent more than natural irrigation—they symbolize the sustaining flow of divine teaching, an interpretation supported by the juxtaposition in verse 2 between חֵפֶץ בְּתוֹרַת ה׳ (cheifetz be-torat YHWH, "his delight is in the teaching of the LORD") and the meditation practice that follows.

This meditation—יֶהְגֶּה יוֹמָם וָלָיְלָה (yehgeh yomam va-laylah, "he meditates day and night")—raises a critical question about practice. The verb הָגָה (h-g-h) is richly ambiguous. Klein's lexicon notes that it means "to hum, murmur, ponder," carrying connotations of both vocalized recitation and internal contemplation. The verb appears elsewhere describing the growl of a lion (Isaiah 31:4) and the cooing of a dove, suggesting a physical, embodied act of speech. This aligns with ancient Jewish practice, where Torah study was never silent but always involved vocalization—a "murmuring" aloud. The phrase "day and night" (יוֹמָם וָלָיְלָה, yomam va-laylah) functions as a merismus, expressing totality through polar opposites. This continuous engagement with Torah appears programmatically in Joshua 1:8: לֹא־יָמוּשׁ סֵפֶר הַתּוֹרָה הַזֶּה מִפִּיךָ וְהָגִיתָ בּוֹ יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה (lo-yamush sefer ha-torah ha-zeh mi-pikha ve-hagita bo yomam va-laylah, "this book of the teaching shall not depart from your mouth, and you shall meditate on it day and night"). The link between continuous meditation and the flourishing tree suggests that the "water" sustaining the righteous is precisely this unceasing engagement with divine instruction.

By contrast, the wicked receive a single terse image: כַּמֹּץ אֲשֶׁר־תִּדְּפֶנּוּ רוּחַ (ka-motz asher tiddefennu ruach, "like chaff that the wind drives away"). The brevity is performative—the form enacts the message of insubstantiality. Chaff (מֹץ, motz) is the agricultural waste product, the lightest and most worthless byproduct of threshing. The verb תִּדְּפֶנּוּ (tiddefennu, "drives away") suggests effortless dispersal. The concordance reveals similar imagery in Psalm 35:5, where enemies are described as כְּמֹץ לִפְנֵי־רוּחַ (ke-motz lifnei-ruach, "as chaff before the wind"), and in Psalm 83:14, where God is petitioned to make adversaries כְּקַשׁ לִפְנֵי־רוּחַ (ke-qash lifnei-ruach, "like stubble before the wind"). The threshing floor was a well-known biblical site of judgment (cf. Ruth 3, 2 Samuel 24, and prophetic literature), reinforcing the judicial overtones.

The forensic language intensifies in verse 5: עַל־כֵּן לֹא־יָקֻמוּ רְשָׁעִים בַּמִּשְׁפָּט (al-ken lo-yaqumu resha'im ba-mishpat, "therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment"). The verb יָקֻמוּ (yaqumu, "stand/arise") has sparked debate. Is this judicial language (the accused unable to stand before the court), resurrection imagery (the wicked not rising at the eschaton), or both? The concordance shows mixed usage. In Deuteronomy 19:15, the phrase לֹא־יָקוּם עֵד אֶחָד בְּאִישׁ (lo-yaqum 'ed echad be-ish, "a single witness shall not stand against a person") uses the verb in a clearly forensic context. Yet in Job 25:3, the phrase לֹא־יָקוּם אוֹרֵהוּ (lo-yaqum 'orehu, "upon whom does his light not arise") suggests a more general sense of endurance or establishment. The phrase בַּמִּשְׁפָּט (ba-mishpat, "in the judgment") could refer to an earthly legal proceeding, divine judgment, or both. The second exclusion—וְחַטָּאִים בַּעֲדַת צַדִּיקִים (ve-chatta'im ba-'adat tzaddiqim, "nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous")—employs the term עֲדַת (adat, "assembly/congregation"), which in the Psalter often refers to cultic or liturgical gatherings (cf. Psalm 22:26, 35:18, 89:6). The wicked are thus excluded both from judicial vindication and from communal worship.

The psalm's concluding verse shifts the ground entirely. The dualism, it turns out, is not ultimately about human moral effort but about divine recognition: כִּֽי־יוֹדֵעַ ה׳ דֶּרֶךְ צַדִּיקִים (ki yodea YHWH derekh tzaddiqim, "for the LORD knows the way of the righteous"). The verb יוֹדֵעַ (yodea, "knows") carries covenantal overtones. In Amos 3:2, God declares to Israel, רַק אֶתְכֶם יָדַעְתִּי מִכֹּל מִשְׁפְּחוֹת הָאֲדָמָה (raq etkhem yada'ti mi-kol mishpachot ha-adamah, "you only have I known of all the families of the earth"). This "knowing" is not mere cognitive awareness but relational acknowledgment, divine election. The way (דֶּרֶךְ, derekh) of the righteous is "known" by God—it exists within the sphere of divine care and recognition. By contrast, the way of the wicked תֹּאבֵד (to'ved, "perishes"). The verb is significantly passive and intransitive. The wicked way does not require active destruction; it simply ceases to exist. This is not divine retribution but ontological collapse. That which is not rooted in God's recognition has no ultimate reality.

The term דֶּרֶךְ (derekh, "way") appears at the beginning and end of the psalm, creating an inclusio that frames the entire composition. In verse 1, we encounter בְּדֶרֶךְ חַטָּאִים (be-derekh chatta'im, "in the way of sinners"). In verse 6, we encounter both דֶּרֶךְ צַדִּיקִים (derekh tzaddiqim, "the way of the righteous") and דֶּרֶךְ רְשָׁעִים (derekh resha'im, "the way of the wicked"). This ring composition is no mere stylistic flourish—it establishes "the way" as the psalm's central concern. The two ways theology is deeply rooted in Deuteronomic thought (cf. Deuteronomy 30:15-20: "See, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil..."). But Psalm 1 reconfigures this tradition. The choice between ways is less about moral willpower than about where one plants oneself. The righteous are "planted" beside life-giving streams; the wicked are blown about like chaff. One is rooted in divine teaching, the other has no anchor.

The psalm's placement at the head of the Psalter is not accidental but redactional and programmatic. Scholars generally agree that the final form of the Psalms reflects post-exilic editing, when Torah piety became central to Jewish identity in the absence of monarchy and temple. Psalm 1 reframes the entire collection—originally cultic songs, royal laments, and communal celebrations—as material for Torah meditation. The emphasis on יוֹמָם וָלָיְלָה (yomam va-laylah, "day and night") continuous study reflects a community for whom temple worship was disrupted or supplemented by text-centered devotion. Every subsequent psalm, whether lament or praise, is now to be read through the lens of this opening vision: blessed engagement with divine teaching, continuous meditation, and the ontological security that comes from being "known" by God.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

Psalm 1 is recited in its entirety during the Yom Kippur evening (*Ma'ariv*) service in multiple traditions. In the Edot HaMizrach rite, the complete psalm opens a devotional sequence that precedes *Aleinu*, forming part of a block of Psalms 1-4 and 24 with an intervening *Yehi Ratzon* supplication. Similarly, in Ashkenazic Yom Kippur night traditions, Psalm 1 introduces a collection of devotional texts including *Shir HaYichud* and *Anim Zemirot*. This concentrated placement on the Day of Atonement underscores the psalm's thematic appropriateness as an opening meditation on righteous conduct during the most solemn moment of the Jewish calendar.

Individual verses from Psalm 1 appear in several distinct liturgical contexts. The phrase וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ ("and he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season") appears in the Rosh Hashanah night Kiddush ceremony in Edot HaMizrach communities, where it functions as scriptural support following the supplications אָנָּא ה׳ הוֹשִׁיעָה נָּא, אָנָּא ה׳ הַצְלִיחָה נָא ("Please, O LORD, save us; please, O LORD, grant us success"). The verse serves as a prooftext for blessing and prosperity in the coming year, transforming the wisdom psalm's individual imagery
