# Introduction Essay

Psalm 1 stands as more than an opening to the Psalter—it functions as a hermeneutical key that transforms the entire collection into a guide for navigating what the psalm calls the "two ways" of human existence. While scholars have long recognized its programmatic function, the evidence suggests something more architecturally sophisticated: this wisdom psalm operates as a theological engine that reframes the diverse genres of the Psalter through the lens of Torah-centered piety, arguing that ultimate human flourishing depends not merely on avoiding evil, but on active, continuous engagement with divine instruction as the wellspring of life itself.

The psalm's opening beatitude, "אַשְׁרֵי הָאִישׁ אֲשֶׁר לֹא הָלַךְ בַּעֲצַת רְשָׁעִים" (*ashrei ha-ish asher lo halakh ba-atzat resha'im*, "Happy is the man who has not walked in the counsel of the wicked"), immediately establishes this binary through what appears to be a straightforward negation. But the Hebrew reveals a more complex taxonomy of moral decline. The threefold progression—walked (הָלַךְ), stood (עָמַד), sat (יָשַב)—traces a trajectory from casual contact to settled commitment, while the three categories of evildoers create what amounts to a spectrum of wickedness: *resha'im* (רְשָׁעִים, the actively wicked), *chatta'im* (חַטָּאִים, sinners or those who miss the mark), and *letzim* (לֵצִים, scoffers or mockers). The BDB lexicon's analysis of *letzim* proves particularly illuminating, defining it as those who "scorn" and noting that "the scorner is proud and haughty, delights in scorning, is incapable of discipline." This isn't merely a list but a progression from active rebellion through moral failure to cynical mockery—a complete taxonomy of spiritual corruption.

What makes this opening remarkable is not just its comprehensiveness but its method. The psalm defines righteousness first by negation, creating space for a positive vision. This rhetorical strategy reflects ancient Near Eastern wisdom traditions where moral instruction often begins with prohibitions, but here the poet uses the negative space to heighten the contrast with what follows: "כִּי אִם בְּתוֹרַת יְהוָה חֶפְצוֹ וּבְתוֹרָתוֹ יֶהְגֶּה יוֹמָם וָלָיְלָה" (*ki im be-torat YHWH cheftzo u-ve-torato yehgeh yomam va-laylah*, "but his delight is in the Torah of the LORD, and on his Torah he meditates day and night").

The shift from "Torah of the LORD" (תוֹרַת יְהוָה) to "his Torah" (תוֹרָתוֹ) has puzzled interpreters for centuries. The Talmudic tradition recorded by Rashi suggests that "initially it is called the Torah of the LORD, and after he has toiled to master it, it is called his own Torah." This reading captures something profound about the psalm's understanding of study: Torah becomes internalized through engagement, not merely memorized but integrated into the very fabric of one's being. The verb *yehgeh* (יֶהְגֶּה), often translated as "meditate," carries connotations of muttering or verbal rumination—suggesting not silent contemplation but active, vocalized engagement with the text. The lexical evidence shows this word refers to "moaning, growling, uttering, speaking," indicating an embodied, almost physical relationship with divine instruction.

The psalm's central metaphor emerges from this foundation: "וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם" (*ve-hayah ke-etz shatul al-palgei-mayim*, "And he shall be like a tree planted beside streams of water"). The imagery here is precise and purposeful. The tree is *shatul* (שָׁתוּל)—not naturally growing but deliberately planted, suggesting divine intentionality rather than accident. The "streams of water" (*palgei-mayim*, פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם) evokes irrigation channels, artificial waterways that ensure consistent nourishment regardless of seasonal variation. This is not a tree dependent on unpredictable rainfall but one with access to reliable, channeled water—a perfect metaphor for the person whose life is sustained by continuous engagement with Torah rather than the sporadic influences of surrounding culture.

The tree's threefold blessing—fruit in season, unfading leaves, and universal success—creates a portrait of comprehensive flourishing that contrasts dramatically with what follows. The wicked receive exactly four Hebrew words: "לֹא־כֵן הָרְשָׁעִים כִּי אִם־כַּמֹּץ אֲשֶׁר־תִּדְּפֶנּוּ רוּחַ" (*lo-khen ha-resha'im ki im-ka-motz asher tiddafennu ruach*, "Not so the wicked, but they are like chaff that the wind drives away"). The brevity itself makes a theological point: wickedness lacks substance, depth, staying power. Where the righteous receive an extended metaphor of rootedness and seasonal reliability, the wicked get a single image of weightlessness and dispersal.

This compression serves the psalm's larger argument about the nature of reality itself. The righteous person is described with agricultural imagery that suggests permanence, rootedness, and cyclical productivity—they exist in harmony with created order. The wicked, by contrast, are *motz* (מֹּץ), the worthless byproduct of grain processing, easily separated and blown away. The Klein Dictionary confirms that chaff represents the "worthless byproduct," emphasizing not just transience but fundamental lack of value.

The psalm's conclusion moves from individual destiny to cosmic perspective: "כִּי־יוֹדֵעַ יְהוָה דֶּרֶךְ צַדִּיקִים וְדֶרֶךְ רְשָׁעִים תֹּאבֵד" (*ki-yodea YHWH derekh tzaddikim ve-derekh resha'im toved*, "For the LORD knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish"). The verb *yodea* (יוֹדֵעַ) means more than intellectual awareness; in Hebrew, knowing implies intimate relationship and active care. The LORD doesn't merely observe the righteous path—he knows it in the sense of approving, supporting, and sustaining it. Meanwhile, the way of the wicked doesn't just fail; it actively perishes (*toved*, תֹּאבֵד), suggesting not passive fade but active destruction.

The psalm's placement as the Psalter's introduction becomes clearer when we recognize its function as an interpretive grid. The laments, praises, royal psalms, and wisdom poems that follow all assume this fundamental binary. When Psalm 2 speaks of kings raging against the LORD's anointed, we understand them as the *resha'im* of Psalm 1. When Psalm 23 describes the LORD's guidance, we see it as the divine "knowing" of the righteous way. The entire Psalter becomes a meditation on these two paths and their ultimate destinations.

In its ancient Near Eastern context, Psalm 1 participates in a widespread wisdom tradition that emphasizes the moral structure of reality, but it innovates by making Torah the decisive factor. Where other wisdom traditions might emphasize natural law, social harmony, or royal instruction, this psalm insists that written divine revelation—and continuous engagement with it—becomes the source of both individual flourishing and cosmic stability. The psalm doesn't merely commend Torah study as one virtue among others; it presents it as the fundamental orientation that determines one's place in the moral universe.

The liturgical tradition has recognized this programmatic function by placing Psalm 1 at threshold moments: it opens Yom Kippur evening prayers in some traditions and appears in seasonal celebrations where themes of renewal and moral choice are paramount. The phrase describing the righteous as a tree "planted by streams of water" (*shatul al-palgei-mayim*) appears in both the Prayer for Rain and in Simchat Torah celebrations, suggesting that Jewish liturgy has understood the psalm's agricultural imagery as fundamentally about spiritual nourishment and Torah's life-giving power.

Psalm 1 thus functions as more than introduction—it establishes the theological grammar that makes the rest of the Psalter intelligible. By insisting that human flourishing depends on continuous, delighted engagement with divine instruction, it transforms the Psalter from a miscellaneous collection of religious poetry into a coherent guide for the "two ways" of existence. The psalm's genius lies in its recognition that the choice between these ways is not made once but renewed daily through the seemingly simple act of meditation on Torah, day and night.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

Psalm 1 occupies significant liturgical space in Jewish worship, appearing both as a complete recitation and through individual verses incorporated into various prayers. The entire psalm is recited during the Maariv (evening) service on Yom Kippur night across both Ashkenazi and Edot HaMizrach traditions, where it serves as a spiritual foundation for the Day of Atonement's penitential themes. In Edot HaMizrach practice, it opens a devotional sequence including Psalms 2, 3, and 24, preceding the Yehi Ratzon supplication and formal evening prayers.

Individual phrases from Psalm 1 appear strategically throughout the liturgical calendar. The complete verse "וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ וְעָלֵהוּ לֹא־יִבּוֹל וְכֹל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ" (And he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water...) appears in the Edot HaMizrach Rosh Hashanah night Kiddush and in the Mussaf Amidah for the Three Pilgrimage Festivals, reinforcing petitions for divine blessing and prosperity.

The tree imagery finds particular resonance in the Tefillat Geshem (Prayer for Rain) recited on Shemini Atzeret, where "כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם" appears within the acrostic "בֵּרַכְתּו כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל פַּלְגֵי מַיִם" (Blessed him like a tree planted by streams of water), connecting the psalm's agricultural metaphor with seasonal prayers for rain. During Simchat Torah, Sefard communities incorporate phrases about avoiding "the counsel of the wicked" (*ba-atzat resha'im*) and remaining like the flourishing tree into the Hakafot liturgy, emphasizing Torah's role in righteous living even during moments of celebration. These liturgical placements reveal how Jewish tradition has understood Psalm 1 as fundamentally concerned with spiritual nourishment, seasonal blessing, and the life-sustaining power of Torah study.
