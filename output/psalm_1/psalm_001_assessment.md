# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 1

What works: The draft rightly treats Psalm 1 as the gate to the Psalter and links its “two ways” to Torah-centered piety. It makes good use of traditional Jewish commentaries (Rashi, Radak, Ibn Ezra) and correctly stresses the verb sequence in v. 1 (walk–stand–sit) and the crucial force of יֶהְגֶּה (yeh-GEH, “mutter/meditate,” v. 2). The image of a transplanted tree by irrigation channels is well handled, and the closing antithesis (v. 6) is read aptly as covenantal “knowing.”

What needs revision: 
- Style: At times the tone leans toward academic insider or sermonizing; it should be leaner, crisper, and more literary, with technical terms briefly defined in context (colon, antithetic parallelism, inclusio, merism).
- Lexicon: “שָׁתוּל” is best rendered “transplanted” (not just “planted”). This matters. “פַלְגֵי־מָיִם” are divided channels; this should be explicit. 
- Sound and structure: The poem’s cadence (the three emphatic לֹא, lo, in v. 1) and the inclusio on “way” (דֶּרֶךְ, derekh, vv. 1, 6) deserve a sharper literary reading. If phonetic points are made, they should be purposeful, not perfunctory.
- LXX: The Septuagint’s renderings (e.g., choosing λοιμοί “pestilent” for לֵצִים) are worth noting because they subtly shift the social portrait of wickedness.
- Figurative database: The chaff motif should be situated with specific parallels (e.g., Psalms 35:5; Isaiah 41:2), and the tree-by-water image alongside Jeremiah 17:7–8 to show the psalm’s distinct nuances.
- Liturgy: The draft collects uses but needs clearer structure, Hebrew citations from the prayers, and a brief statement of theological significance.
- Missed rabbinic uses: Torah Temimah’s applications of v. 3 (“fruit in its season”) to conjugal rhythms on Erev Shabbat are too telling to omit.

Questions answerable from the supplied materials: 
- Does “knowing” (יוֹדֵעַ) in v. 6 mean mere cognition or covenantal regard? (Answer: the latter, per Radak and usage across Scripture.)
- Is the tree “planted” or “transplanted”? (Answer: “transplanted,” with implications of divine agency and careful cultivation.)
- Does the psalm’s rhetoric promise naïve prosperity? (Answer: no; the imagery is seasonal, measured, and tethered to “in its season,” v. 3.)

Overall: tighten the prose; sharpen Hebrew-literary detail; define terms; integrate LXX and liturgy judiciously; add a few decisive, vivid insights.
