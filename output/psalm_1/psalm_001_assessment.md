# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 1

What works: The draft rightly treats Psalm 1 as the Psalter’s threshold—framing the “two ways,” highlighting the pivot from refusal (v. 1) to delight (v. 2), and drawing out the asymmetry of v. 6 (God “knows” the righteous way; the wicked way “perishes”). The notes on חֵפֶץ (delight) and הָגָה (to murmur/meditate), and on שָׁתוּל (transplanted) and פַלְגֵי־מַיִם (irrigation channels), are solid. The draft also nods toward liturgical use.

What needs work: 
- It leans on generalities where the text rewards close reading. The rhetorical mechanics—parallelism, anaphora (repetition at a line’s opening), and the poem’s internal echoes (“stand” in vv. 1 and 5)—should be made explicit. 
- The LXX (ancient Greek translation) is left unused; its choices (“μελετήσει,” meditate/study; “λοιμῶν,” pestilent persons) sharpen interpretation. 
- Figurative language is under-illustrated by specific biblical parallels; Psalm 1’s chaff and tree are standard images with a history (e.g., Ps 35:5; Job 21:18; Isa 17:13; Jer 17:8) that should be mobilized to show what is distinctive here.
- Rabbinic reception (Avodah Zarah 19; Sanhedrin 107b) and liturgical usage are mentioned but not integrated as interpretation—how tradition reads Psalm 1 should be shown to illuminate the psalm itself.
- Occasional phonetic asides feel gratuitous. Use sound only where it illuminates craft (e.g., the triple לֹא, “not,” in v. 1).
- Some missed opportunities: the legal idiom “stand in judgment” (v. 5) resonates with Deut 19:15 (“a matter shall stand”), and Joshua 1:8 tightly links Torah recitation to “prospering,” echoing v. 3.

Figurative language assessment: The draft does not systematically cite parallels. It should: 
- Tree by water: Jer 17:8; Ps 92:13-15.
- Chaff: Ps 35:5; Job 21:18; Isa 17:13.
- “Walk in God’s ways”: Deut 8:6; 10:12.
Doing so will let us ask: how does Psalm 1’s planting-as-transplant (שָׁתוּל) and cultivation (פלגי) nuance a well-worn image? Why is chaff so tersely sketched here? And what do these choices signal about the psalm’s confident, programmatic tone?

In sum: deepen the literary analysis, bring in the LXX and specific cross-references, integrate rabbinic and liturgical reception as interpretation, and refine the style—lucid, precise, unlabored.
