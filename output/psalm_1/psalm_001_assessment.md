# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 1

The draft introduction rightly treats Psalm 1 as the gate to the Psalter and highlights its asymmetry: the righteous receive luxuriant exposition; the wicked are dispatched in a gust. The commentary shows command of Hebrew terms (`’ashrei`, `yehgeh`, `shatul`), recognizes the merism “day and night,” and draws helpful lines to Joshua 1:8 and Jeremiah 17:8. The use of traditional Jewish sources (Avodah Zarah 19a; Rashi, Radak, Meiri) and the attention to the “God’s Torah”/“his Torah” shift are strengths.

Weaknesses: the prose sometimes lapses into insider shorthand (e.g., “Hiphil” or “construct” without lay explanation) and overconfident historical claims (“post‑exilic manifesto”) that would be better framed as plausible readings. Sound analysis leans speculative; keep only what the phonetic data clearly supports (the triple `lo’` anaphora). The LXX is noted but not analyzed where it matters (e.g., rendering of `letzim` as λοιμός/λοιμῶν, “pestilence/pestilent fellows,” a telling shift). The tree/chaff metaphors deserve fuller comparison with their biblical pattern of usage (Jer 17:7–8; Ps 35:5; Isa 17:13). Verse 5’s juridical idiom could be sharpened by pointing to Deuteronomy’s courtroom “standing” (Deut 19:15: “a matter stands”) and to BDB’s legal sense of `qum`.

Missed opportunities: the editorial pairing of Psalms 1–2 (“happy”/`ashrei` in 1:1; “happy” again in 2:12) frames the Psalter’s entrance; that connection should surface. The Torah Temimah’s reception-history vignettes (Kiddushin 32a on “his Torah”; Ketubot 62b on “its fruit in season”) are worth concise inclusion. The “two ways” motif has rich Pentateuchal grounding (Deut 5:29–30; 11:28; 30:15–20) that should be foregrounded before any historical theorizing.

Figurative-language assessment: the draft cites some parallels but can do more and better. Each major figure should be tied to at least one concrete biblical parallel with brief pattern notes: path/way idiom (Deut 5:30), tree by water (Jer 17:8; Ezek 19:10), chaff in judgment (Ps 35:5; Isa 17:13). Finally, define terms for lay readers (LXX, MT, merism, anaphora, inclusio, colon), and pare back jargon. The revised version below aims to do all this while keeping the prose lucid and inviting.
