# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 1

The draft rightly treats Psalm 1 as an architectural threshold to the Psalter, and it makes several strong moves: the “two ways” frame is clear; the treatment of שָׁתוּל (shā-THŪL, “transplanted”) and פַלְגֵי־מָיִם (pal-ghēy-MĀ-yim, “water channels”) is accurate and illuminating; the shift from “Torah of YHWH” to “his Torah” is well read through Rashi and rabbinic tradition; and the liturgical notices are a valuable, underused strand.

That said, the essay needs tightening and some corrections. Most pressing: it claims “the wicked receive exactly four Hebrew words,” which is simply false (v. 4 is longer, and the brevity point stands without the error). The tone sometimes turns breathless (“theological engine”), when the psalm’s spare craft speaks best for itself. Some scholarly terms (e.g., “merism,” “inclusio”) are used without definition for general readers. The phonetic analysis notes “stress pattern” vaguely; if we comment on sound, we should use the provided phonetics (e.g., the triple anaphora of לֹא, LŌ’, in v. 1). The LXX deserves a clearer glance: its “καθέδρα λοιμῶν” (“seat of pestilent [men]”) broadens לֵצִים (lē-TSIY-m, “scoffers”) in a revealing way, and μελετᾶν (“to study, practice”) nuances יֶהְגֶּה (yeh-GEH). 

Missed opportunities: (1) the editorial seam with Psalm 2 (“אַשְׁרֵי” inclusio at 1:1 and 2:12) that frames the opening diptych; (2) explicit parallels to the Bible’s “path” metaphor (Deuteronomy 5:29–30; 11:28; Proverbs 4:18–19), confirming that “way” (דֶּרֶךְ, DE-rekh) is a moral itinerary; (3) the figurative patterning of “chaff” (מֹּץ, MŌTS) across Psalms 35:5 and 83:14 and Isaiah 41:2; (4) verse 5’s irony (“did not stand” in v. 1 // “will not stand” in judgment) and Malbim’s smart distinction between רְשָׁעִים (rə-shā-ʿIY-m, hardened wicked) and חַטָּאִים (ḥat-tā-’IY-m, strayers). Liturgy should be structured more clearly, with Hebrew prayer citations and why they matter. 

In revision, we will: correct errors; define terms; integrate LXX and sound where they actually help; fold in the “Psalms 1–2” seam; deepen verse-by-verse with concrete Hebrew, figurative parallels, and liturgical reception; and smooth the tone for an intelligent lay audience.
