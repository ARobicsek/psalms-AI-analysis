# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 1

What works: The current draft rightly frames Psalm 1 as the Psalter’s gateway and traces the psalm’s “two ways” through its emblematic images: the transplanted tree and the wind-blown chaff. It gives due weight to the shift from ethics to theology in verse 6 (“the LORD knows”), treats the triad walk/stand/sit well, and explains the verb הָגָה as embodied, murmured study, linking to Joshua 1:8. Much of the medieval Jewish commentary is well deployed, and the structural asymmetry between righteous and wicked is perceptively described.

Weaknesses: The prose is often longer than it needs to be, and at points the tone veers toward the programmatic. Several opportunities are missed. When parallels are cited (e.g., chaff imagery, “stand” in judgment, “know”), they are rarely quoted in Hebrew and English; readers should see the texts. LXX differences (notably its puzzling rendering of לֵצִים) go unremarked. The inclusio on דֶּרֶךְ is noted but not exploited to connect Psalm 1 to Psalm 2 (both share הָגָה). The imagery of פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם likely denotes irrigation channels; the draft asserts this but doesn’t show how other texts use the same vocabulary. Verse 5’s “assembly of the righteous” could benefit from concrete Psalms examples of עֵדָה/קָהָל. The “Modern Jewish Liturgical Use” section is serviceable but thin: it should quote the liturgy in Hebrew and English and clarify how the tradition re-reads the psalm.

Answerable questions left hanging: (1) How do biblical parallels sharpen “he meditates” (הָגָה)? (2) What does “stand in the judgment” (לֹא־יָקֻמוּ … בַּמִּשְׁפָּט) mean in concrete biblical usage? (3) What does “know” (יָדַע) imply in covenant contexts? (4) How does Psalm 92’s “planted” (שְׁתוּלִים) deepen the arboreal image? These can be answered with the bundle.

Figurative-language assessment: Many excellent cross-references are named but not quoted; that is the chief failure. The revision below shows rather than tells, with Hebrew-plus-English examples, clearer definitions of terms (anaphora, merism, inclusio, colon), brief LXX notes, and integrated liturgical quotations. The goal is lucidity, concision, and depth.
