**Verse 1**

The psalm begins with אַשְׁרֵי־הָאִישׁ (`'ash-rēy-hā-'IY-sh`), “Happy is the person.” Medievals noticed that אַשְׁרֵי (’ashrei) is plural in form; Radak glossed it as a cluster of goods, not a single stroke of luck. The opening line then sets a negative profile in three beats: “who has not walked in the counsel of the wicked, nor stood in the path of sinners, nor sat in the seat of scoffers.” The verbs—הָלַךְ (`hā-LAKH`), עָמַד (`ʿā-MĀDH`), יָשַׁב (`yā-SHĀV`)—trace moral settling: from motion (walk) to arrested presence (stand) to settled belonging (sit). The triple anaphora לֹא (LŌ’) … לֹא … לֹא gives the line its pulse; read aloud, the negatives strike like posts in a fence.

The three groups are not mere synonyms. רְשָׁעִים (`rə-shā-ʿIY-m`) are the hardened wicked; חַטָּאִים (ḥat-tā-’IY-m) are those who miss the mark; לֵצִים (lē-TSIY-m) are scoffers. BDB’s portrait of the lēṣ is sharp: proud, immune to correction, delighting in mockery (Proverbs 1:22; 9:7–8; 21:24). Torah Temimah (Avodah Zarah 18b) anchors “the seat of scoffers” in social realities: “ההולך לאיצטדינין ולכרקום… הרי זה מושב לצים” (“One who goes to the stadium or circus… that is a seat of scoffers”). The poem aims not only at private vice but at cultural habitats that make cynicism feel normal.

The line is also about paths. “Counsel… path… seat” sketches a movement from advice to habitual way to identity. In the Bible, “way” (דֶּרֶךְ, DE-rekh) is a moral itinerary: “Do not turn aside to the right or to the left” (Deuteronomy 5:29–30); “you have been quick to stray from the path” (Deuteronomy 9:16). Proverbs 4:18–19 sets the binary with Psalm 1’s starkness: “The path of the righteous is like the light of dawn… The way of the wicked is deep darkness.” Our poem begins by ruling out the wrong companions and the wrong rhythms. That negative profile is not puritanism; it is preparation for a positive delight (v. 2).

The Septuagint (LXX) renders “seat of scoffers” as καθέδρα λοιμῶν, “seat of pestilent [men],” treating scoffing as a social contagion. The translator also keeps the movement: “did not go… did not stand… did not sit.” The Greek confirms how ancient readers heard the line: not a single prohibition but a staged warning about moral gravity.

Finally, a small irony seeds the poem’s end: the righteous refuse to “stand” (עָמַד) where sin traffics; in v. 5 the wicked “will not stand” (לֹא־יָקֻמוּ) in judgment. What you refuse now, you will be refused later.

**Verse 2**

The pivot comes with an emphatic contrast: כִּי אִם (ki ’im, “but rather”). Happiness is not mere avoidance; it is attachment. “But his delight is in the Torah of YHWH, and in his Torah he meditates day and night.” The noun חֵפֶץ (`ḥef-TSŌ`) is stronger than approval; it is pleasure, desire. The phrase תּוֹרַת יְהוָה (torat YHWH, “Torah of YHWH”) shifts, with deliberate boldness, to וּבְתוֹרָתוֹ (“and in his Torah”). Rashi hears the internalization: at first it is God’s Torah; after toil, it is yours. Meiri, with philological tact, notes that had the second phrase referred to God again, we might expect “בְּדָתוֹ” (“in His law” with a parallel term). The variation is meaning-bearing.

The key verb יֶהְגֶּה (`yeh-GEH`) is wonderfully physical. BDB’s range—“moan, growl, utter, muse”—runs from sound to sense. The study envisioned is vocal: murmured recitation, not silent scanning. Joshua 1:8 commands the same daily rumination; the LXX’s μελετᾶν (“to practice”) reinforces the sense of repeated rehearsal that penetrates memory and manner. The time-phrase יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה (yō-MĀM wā-LĀ-ye-lāh, “day and night”) is a merism, naming the poles to mean “always.” Psalm 55:11 uses the same idiom for constant watch; Genesis 8:22 uses “day and night” to denote ongoing cycles. Here the phrase turns study into a habit forming a life.

Torah Temimah (Kiddushin 32a) preserves a rabbinic dialectic that circles this verse: Is the Torah “His,” or can a teacher waive the honor due because it is “his” (the teacher’s) to waive? Rava’s concluding turn cites our verse—“וּבְתוֹרָתוֹ יֶהְגֶּה”—to insist that the Torah becomes one’s own through devotion, even as it remains God’s. The paradox both democratizes and sanctifies study.

We should not miss the literary engine. Verse 1’s triple לֹא (“not… not… not”) gives way to a single desire. The poet’s craft—negative space opening to a positive center—tells a moral truth: habits of refusal make room for a persistent joy. This is not sternness; it is eros redirected to the right object.

**Verse 3**

The poem’s thesis becomes an image: “He is like a tree transplanted by channels of water.” שָׁתוּל (`shā-THŪL`) is precise: a transplant, not a volunteer. The righteous are not naturally lucky trees; they have been sited and tended. פַלְגֵי־מָיִם (`pal-ghēy-MĀ-yim`) are divided channels—the irrigation system of an intentional planter. Across the Bible such “streams” signal reliable nourishment (Psalm 46:4; Isaiah 32:2). Jeremiah 17:8 is the closest parallel: a tree unafraid in drought; Ezekiel 47:12 pictures trees whose “leaf does not wither” (לֹא יִבּוֹל, lō’ yi-BŌL), the very phrase here.

Three clauses complete the portrait: “that yields its fruit in its season” (פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ), “its leaf does not wither,” “and whatever he does prospers” (כֹּל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ). The first tempers any simplistic “prosperity gospel”: fruit “in season” implies rhythm, not constant harvest. The second speaks to endurance; Rashi famously extends it—“even its leaves are for use,” i.e., even the side-talk of sages repays listening. The third, comprehensive line is often misunderstood. Wisdom literature means by הַצְלָחָה (success) thriving within the moral order, not invulnerability to misfortune. The LXX’s καταευοδωθήσεται (he “will be prospered well”) carries the same moral shading: the path made straight, not the bank account fattened.

This verse has an ongoing liturgical life. In Tefillat Geshem (Shemini Atzeret), the community prays: “בֵּרַכְתּו כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל פַּלְגֵי מַיִם” (Bless him like a tree planted by streams of water), yoking Psalm 1’s irrigation to the season’s plea for rain. The metaphor is doing double duty: Torah is a watercourse; rain is grace; rootedness is both discipline and gift.

The figurative pattern is common but pointed. Our database shows “tree/fruit/leaf” imagery regularly marks fertility or offspring (e.g., Deuteronomy 28:4), but here the agricultural scene is moral: stability, appropriateness (“in season”), perseverance. The psalmist prefers horticultural patience to spectacle. A life close to water is slow and sure.

**Verse 4**

“Not so the wicked!” The abruptness (לֹא־כֵן, lō’-KHĒN) is a reset: everything said of rootedness does not apply. “Rather, they are like chaff that the wind drives away” (כַּמֹּץ אֲשֶׁר־תִּדְּפֶנּוּ רוּחַ, kam-MŌTS ’ăsher-tid-FEN-nū RŪ-aḥ). מֹּץ (MŌTS) is the fine husk stripped from grain on the threshing floor; BDB notes נָדַף (to “drive, scatter”) often connotes force. The metaphor recurs: “Let them be like chaff before the wind” (Psalm 35:5); “like stubble before the wind” (Psalm 83:14); Isaiah 41:2 uses the image for nations routed by a conqueror. The usage pattern is consistent: chaff equals insubstantiality and vulnerability.

It is also instructive to notice the poem’s proportions. The righteous get an extended, layered portrait (root, fruit, leaf, success). The wicked get one image, conventional and brief. The brevity is not an accident of space; it is part of the verdict. Wickedness is a negative capability—it produces waste and gets carried off. Radak adds a farmer’s note: chaff not only has no value; it stings eyes and fouls gardens when blown about. It is useless and harmful.

The LXX doubles the negation—οὐχ οὕτως οἱ ἀσεβεῖς, οὐχ οὕτως—pressing the point and making the chaff line almost a refrain. The Greek later adds “ἀπὸ προσώπου γῆς” (“from the face of the earth”), a flourish not in the Hebrew that underscores disappearance.

Theological modesty is in order. Verse 4 does not claim the wicked always present as losers; Psalm 73 knows they often prosper. It claims, rather, that their way “will not stand” (cf. v. 5). The image is a judgment of quality, not a snapshot of circumstances: a husk cannot carry weight.

**Verse 5**

“Therefore” (עַל־כֵּן, ʿal-KĒN) shifts from metaphor to consequence. “The wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.” The verb יָקֻמוּ (`yā-QU-mū`) here is forensic: to stand one’s ground in court, to endure scrutiny. The irony with v. 1 ripens: the blessed refused to “stand in the path of sinners”; now those very sinners cannot stand when it counts. The structure makes the moral point memorable.

Two spheres appear: individual judgment (בַּמִּשְׁפָּט, bam-mish-PĀT) and communal belonging (בַּעֲדַת צַדִּיקִים, ba-ʿa-DHATH tsa-diy-QIY-m). The “assembly” (עֵדָה) is not a chance crowd; BDB notes it is an appointed congregation. Malbim’s gloss is subtle and helpful: “wicked” (רשעים) fail even when judged alone; “sinners” (חטאים), who err by appetite and weakness, might find some extenuation before God but still cannot be included in the refined measure of the righteous community. Ibn Ezra offers a more existential reading of “judgment” as “the day of death”—the decisive divine reckoning when the question of belonging is settled.

The LXX flattens the two spheres slightly by repeating its favorite word: “οὐδὲ ἁμαρτωλοὶ ἐν βουλῇ δικαίων,” “nor sinners in the council of the righteous,” echoing v. 1’s βουλή. Even so, the sense remains: no seat in that company.

Liturgically, the line’s “assembly of the righteous” invites the congregation to see itself, for a moment, as that body—if only aspirationally. But the psalm also cautions against presumption. The “assembly” in view is God’s, not ours to police; the boundary runs through a life before it runs between people.

**Verse 6**

“For YHWH knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.” The causal כִּי (ki) grounds all that precedes in God’s regard. As Radak explains, “to know” (יֹודֵעַ, `yō-DHĒ-aʿ`) here is “to recognize and attend in order to do good.” The verb has covenantal warmth: “I knew you in the wilderness” (Hosea 13:5). Ibn Ezra, thinking about divine knowledge philosophically, insists God knows both universals and particulars; he then reads our verse ontologically: the righteous way adheres to what lasts and so “stands” in divine knowledge; the wicked way adheres to what cannot last and so “perishes.” The psalm’s last word, תֹּאבֵד (`tō-VĒDH`), carries the weight of many biblical uses: to vanish, fail, be destroyed (cf. Psalm 37:20; 73:27).

Formally, the verse is perfect antithetic parallelism: A (God’s knowing) versus B (the perishing of the other way). The inclusio is complete: we began with “counsel/path/seat” and end with “way… way,” the road motif bracketing the whole. The psalm’s argument is deliberately unoriginal; it repeats Moses and Proverbs. “Follow only the path that YHWH has enjoined upon you, so that you may thrive” (Deuteronomy 5:30). “There is a way that seems right… but its end is the way to death” (Proverbs 14:12). Psalm 1’s gift is tone and image: it makes the choice visible and habitual—a tree and chaff; a voice murmuring Torah; a God who knows.

There is also an editorial grace note: with this “אַשְׁרֵי” at the start and the “אַשְׁרֵי” at Psalm 2:12, the canonical editors bound private devotion to public tumult. The one who delights in Torah (Psalm 1) is the same one who takes refuge in the God who laughs at raging nations (Psalm 2). Between those two “happys,” a reader learns how to stand.
