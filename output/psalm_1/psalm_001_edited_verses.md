**Verse 1**

The psalm opens with אַשְׁרֵי הָאִישׁ, “Happy is the man.” Radak notes that אַשְׁרֵי is plural in form, hinting that happiness is composite, a confluence of goods. In Greek the line becomes μακάριος ἀνήρ, the beatitude cadence that later literature will make famous.

The three clauses build a staircase of refusal—“has not walked… has not stood… has not sat” (`**LŌ'** hā-**LAKH** … **LŌ'** ʿā-**MĀDH** … **LŌ'** yā-**SHĀV**`). The repeated `**LŌ'**` (no/not) creates anaphora (deliberate initial repetition), and the sibilant cluster in “מוֹשַׁב … יָשַׁב” (mōshav … yashav) tightens the cadence. The metaphor of “walking” as conduct is idiomatic: “לָלֶכֶת בִּדְרָכָיו” (“to walk in His ways”) defines covenant life (Deut 8:6; 10:12; 19:9). “Standing” carries forensic force: “לֹא יָקוּם עֵד אֶחָד” (“A single witness shall not stand,” Deut 19:15) means “shall not be legally valid.” “Sitting” suggests settled belonging—taking one’s seat among a group.

The nouns also escalate: רְשָׁעִים (“wicked”), the broad antithesis of righteousness; חַטָּאִים (“sinners”), those who miss the target; and לֵצִים (“scoffers”), the incurable mockers of Proverbs (BDB: proud, allergic to correction; see Prov 9:7–8; 21:24). The Septuagint renders לֵצִים as λοιμοί, “pestilent [people],” highlighting their social toxicity rather than their sarcasm. The pairing “עֲצַת רְשָׁעִים” (“counsel of the wicked”) recurs elsewhere only in Job 21:16, where the speaker distances himself from that counsel—an intertext that underlines the psalm’s call to refusal. “מוֹשַׁב לֵצִים” (“seat of scoffers”) is unique to this verse; the very uniqueness of the phrase makes it memorable as a social warning label.

Poetically, each colon (single line of verse) pushes the image forward: from passing association (“walk”) to lingering presence (“stand”) to settled identity (“sit”). The “way” (דֶּרֶךְ), introduced here, will return in v. 6 as an inclusio (a repeat at beginning and end that frames the unit). The verse sketches a sociology of virtue by negation: do not apprentice yourself to cynicism; do not ratify wicked advice by your presence; do not become what you sit among.

Finally, the stress pattern in the provided phonetic line makes the triple `**LŌ'**` audible as a rhythmic brake, while the shared “-SHAV” in “מוֹשָׁב … יָשָׁב” reinforces the idea of settling. Form enacts meaning: the poem slows the reader at each threshold—walk … stand … sit—so that the “no” can do its work.

**Verse 2**

“כִּי אִם” marks the reversal—“but rather.” The movement from negative to positive is the hinge of the psalm’s ethic. The blessed person delights: “כִּי אִם־בְּתוֹרַת יְהוָה חֶפְצוֹ” (“but his pleasure is in the teaching of YHWH”). חֵפֶץ denotes desire, not duty; BDB registers its use for divine purpose as well (Isa 53:10). Piety here is eros for wisdom.

The verb “יֶהְגֶּה” (`yeh-**GEH**`) is bodily: to murmur, growl, mutter. It is the on-the-lips study style of antiquity, the sound of words being kept in circulation until their sense settles in. Its semantic range includes “to plot” (negatively in Ps 2:1: “לָמָּה רָגְשׁוּ גוֹיִם… וִיהְגּוּ רִיק”—“why do the nations rage… and peoples devise vain things”), which heightens the contrast: the righteous “plot” Torah; nations “plot” vanity. The merism “יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה” (“day and night”) signals comprehensiveness, as when Joshua is commanded, “וְהָגִיתָ בּוֹ יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה” (Josh 1:8). This is not a stopwatch requirement but a center of gravity: what does the mind return to when it has a moment?

Rashi, citing Avodah Zarah 19a, notices the pivot from “תּוֹרַת יְהוָה” to “וּבְתוֹרָתוֹ”: at first it is God’s Torah; after labor it becomes yours. That possessive pronoun marks internalization. The psalm thus defines devotion not as generic spirituality but as the joyful, sustained attention to revealed instruction—a specifically Israelite move when set against ANE wisdom’s courtly pragmatism.

Sound and syntax matter. The flowing vowels in `**KIY** 'im-bə-thō-**RATH** … khef-**TSŌ**` contrast with the staccato negatives of v. 1. The music shifts from “no-no-no” to a long vowel pour, matching the content: renunciation opens into savoring. The verse also completes a parallel with v. 1: avoiding corrosive counsel (“עֲצַת רְשָׁעִים”) is matched by embracing YHWH’s counsel; “walking/standing/sitting” is replaced by “meditating.”

Liturgically, the phrase “יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה” reverberates in the Birkhot HaTorah (daily blessings over Torah), where Joshua 1:8 is recited; the shared language underscores the tradition’s reading of Psalm 1 as a charter for life ordered by study.

Define two terms: “merism” is naming two extremes (“day and night”) to suggest the whole. “Colon” is a single poetic line; here, the colon pair works as “A is so, and what’s more, B.”

**Verse 3**

The central simile is lush and precise: “וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם.” שָׁתוּל (shātul) is not simply “planted” but “transplanted”—set intentionally (BDB; cf. Jer 17:8; Ezek 19:10; Ps 92:14). The site, “פַּלְגֵי מַיִם,” denotes channels, divided streams—irrigation runnels rather than a lone river. This is husbandry: stable water supply engineered for flourishing.

The triad that follows is a picture of steady abundance: “אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ” (“that yields its fruit in its season”), “וְעָלֵהוּ לֹא יִבּוֹל” (“its leaf does not wither”), “וְכֹל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ” (“and in all he does he prospers”). The verb יִבּוֹל (from נָבֵל) elsewhere describes withering leaves (Isa 34:4) and moral decline (Ps 37:2). Negated here, it renders a moral-botanical stability. יַצְלִיחַ (Hifil of צלח) is the causative of “advance/succeed,” often with God as the agent (“YHWH made all he did prosper,” Gen 39:3–4). The psalm leaves the agent implicit, but within the canon the verb leans theologically: prosperity comes by alignment with divine instruction.

The image has a biblical cluster: Jeremiah 17:8 uses the same transplanting near water; Ezekiel 47:12 pictures trees by a life-giving stream whose “leaf does not wither.” Our psalm’s channels connect a righteous person to a reliable source in a climate where rain is not a given. That concreteness matters: the metaphor is not reward-by-dispensation but rootedness-by-placement.

The absolute tone of “כֹּל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ” has long provoked commentary. The Psalter will qualify the timetable (see Ps 73), and life does the same. But the metaphor quietly answers the worry: fruit “in season.” Stability is seasonal, not instantaneous; the blessing of Torah is sufficiency at the right time, not an immunity to drought. Even the leaf—what seems decorative—is preserved; rabbinic readers took this to mean that even the offhand conversation of the learned has purpose (Rashi ad loc., Avodah Zarah 19b).

Phonetically, the provided stresses—`wə-hā-**YĀH** kə-**ʿĒTS** shā-**THŪL** ʿal-pal-ghēy-**MĀ**-yim`—open into long vowels (YĀH… ʿĒTS… MĀ-) that slow the line into a broad, verdant cadence. The sound fits the picture: a planted, well-watered life.

Figurative pattern: the “tree by water” is a wisdom staple (Jer 17:8), but the plural “channels” marks cultivated abundance. This is Israel’s desert agriculture transposed into moral topography.

**Verse 4**

“לֹא כֵן הָרְשָׁעִים” (“Not so the wicked!”) is a sudden snap. The image is chaff: “כַּמֹּץ אֲשֶׁר־תִּדְּפֶנּוּ רוּחַ” (“like chaff which the wind drives away”). מֹץ is the fine husk left after threshing, worthless and light. The verb נָדַף (“drive away”) appears with wind as subject elsewhere (Ps 68:3; Isa 41:2); the wicked are imagined as unanchored residue. The figurative language database locates the chaff image some ten times; Psalm 35:5 (“Let them be like chaff before the wind”) and Psalm 83:14 (“like stubble before the wind”) are close parallels; Isaiah 17:13 adds the threshing-floor context. In every case, the pattern is fragility and ephemerality under divine judgment.

What is distinctive here is the asymmetry of development. The righteous are unfolded across three clauses of growth and season; the wicked receive a single breath of dispersion. The psalm refuses to grant evil an elaborate poetics. Radak underlines chaff’s nuisance: it blows into eyes and gardens, doing harm as it goes, but it has no substance and no future.

Sound-wise, the line’s stressed syllables `lō'-**KHĒN** … **MŌTS** …` land on harsh gutturals and hard consonants, then the air of “רוּחַ” empties the line. The phonetic effect is vanishing.

Theologically, this is not retribution fantasy; it is ontology. Chaff is not punished; it is what it is—disconnected from grain, easily moved, quickly gone. The psalm insists that moral choices have weight or weightlessness; one outcome leaves residue, the other does not.

**Verse 5**

“עַל־כֵּן” (“Therefore”) draws the legal conclusion. “לֹא יָקֻמוּ רְשָׁעִים בַּמִּשְׁפָּט” (“The wicked will not stand in the judgment”). The verb יָקוּם (“stand/arise”) is a legal term for validity (Deut 19:15: “עַל־פִּי שְׁנֵי עֵדִים… יָקוּם דָּבָר,” “by two witnesses a matter shall stand”). To “stand” at judgment is to be upheld; they will not. Nor will “חַטָּאִים” (“sinners”) be in “בַּעֲדַת צַדִּיקִים” (“the assembly of the righteous”). עֵדָה is the appointed congregation (a technical term in Pentateuchal usage). Here the image shifts from court to community: exclusion is not only a verdict but a loss of belonging.

Medieval readers debated timing. Radak hears “the day of death”: no rising again into the noble assembly; others read an eschatological horizon. Malbim suggests a two-tiered hearing: a person might “stand” when judged by his own weak excuses but cannot stand when measured among those who mastered the same appetites and chose otherwise. Either way, the verse establishes a forensic horizon that makes sense of the psalm’s moral urgency.

Phonetically, the stresses `ʿal-**KĒN** lō'-yā-**QU**-mū … bam-mish-**PĀT**` thump like a gavel—“there-fore … stand … judg-ment”—a mimetic cadence of finality.

Comparative idiom: “stand” as “endure or prevail” is common (Ps 24:3: “מִי־יַעֲמֹד בִּמְקוֹם קָדְשׁוֹ,” “who may stand in His holy place?”). “Assembly of the righteous” answers the “seat of scoffers” in v. 1; the psalm’s social logic runs from benches to congregations.

**Verse 6**

The final couplet is antithetic parallelism at its most distilled: “כִּי־יוֹדֵעַ יְהוָה דֶּרֶךְ צַדִּיקִים // וְדֶרֶךְ רְשָׁעִים תֹּאבֵד.” To “know” (יָדַע) in biblical idiom frequently signals covenantal care, selection, and sustained regard (Exod 33:12: “יְדַעְתִּיךָ בְשֵׁם,” “I have known you by name”; Hos 13:5: “אָנֹכִי יְדַעְתִּיךָ בַּמִּדְבָּר,” “I knew you in the wilderness”). Rashi paraphrases: the righteous way remains before Him; the wicked path He removes from before Him. The verb תֹּאבֵד (“perishes”) has punch (BDB: used for annihilation of idols, peoples, hopes). Here the way itself comes to nothing, not merely the walker.

The inclusio on “דֶּרֶךְ” (v. 1, v. 6) frames the poem: life is a route; God’s care is pictured as a road preserved; the opposite road is a cul-de-sac. Malbim presses the metaphysics: what God “knows” abides; what God does not “know” cannot endure.

Two clarifications for readers:
- “Antithetic parallelism” is when a second line opposes the first to sharpen meaning (“A is so; B is its opposite”). The psalm’s last line is the textbook case.
- “Inclusio” is a framing device: the same key word opens and closes the unit to mark its unity and focus.

The Greek version (LXX) reads, “ὅτι γιγνώσκει κύριος ὁδὸν δικαίων // καὶ ὁδὸς ἀσεβῶν ἀπολεῖται”—very close to the Hebrew. The makarios of v. 1 and the gnōskei (“knows”) of v. 6 set the tone for how the Greek-speaking synagogue and later readers heard the psalm: as a beatitude anchored in a God who keeps a people’s way.

Across six verses, Psalm 1 moves from the company we keep, through the habits we love, to the kind of future such loves make possible. It is not a lecture, finally, but a planting: the editors set a tree with a steady water source at the very gate of prayer and invited us to step under its shade.

- “MT” (Masoretic Text): the standard medieval Hebrew text tradition.
- “BDB” (Brown–Driver–Briggs): a classic Hebrew lexicon, useful for word ranges and examples.
- “Colon”: a single line or half-line of Hebrew verse.
- “Inclusio”: bracketing a unit with the same term or phrase at beginning and end.
- “Antithetic parallelism”: a poetic device where the second line opposes the first to clarify meaning.
