Verse 1

The threefold refusal—“לֹא הָלַךְ … לֹא עָמָד … וּבְמוֹשַׁב לֵצִים לֹא יָשָׁב”—is more than moral scruple; it is choreography. The verbs sketch descent from transient exposure to fixed identity: walking (הָלַךְ), then standing (עָמַד), then sitting (יָשַׁב). The stress pattern in the supplied phonetic line places weight on each לֹא (`LŌ'`), making negation the beat that blocks the slide. Hebrew wisdom loves such staircases (sometimes called “climactic” or “staircase” parallelism when lines build by repetition and addition), but here the repetition is negative—a beautifully austere start.

The three groups map a social world: רְשָׁעִים (`rə-shā-‘IY-m`) are the “wicked”—people whose agency bends toward injustice; חַטָּאִים (`ḥat-tā-’IY-m`) are “sinners”—those whose path is marked by missing the mark; לֵצִים (`lē-TSIY-m`) are “scoffers,” whom BDB calls unteachable and haughty. The Septuagint’s “καθέδρα λοιμῶν” (“seat of pestilent [men]”) reads the last not as wit but contagion—mockery that corrupts a community. Ibn Ezra already sensed gradients here: influences that “do not stand at one standard,” luring the naive to “walk in counsel” and then fix them in place.

Two structural touches deserve notice. First, “way” (דֶּרֶךְ, derekh) appears already—“the way of sinners”—preparing the inclusio with v. 6. Second, the psalm begins with a beatitude (אַשְׁרֵי, `'ash-RĒY`), a formula used across Psalms (e.g., 2:11; 32:1) to open a horizon rather than to end an argument. Medievals (Radak, Meiri) note the plural form signals composite well-being; Malbim distinguishes “success” in this world from “happiness” of the soul—the verse aims at the latter.

Aggadic reception gives the verse social edge. Torah Temimah cites Avodah Zarah 18b condemning the Roman stadium and circus as “מוֹשַׁב לֵצִים,” applying the line to institutions that professionalize diversion. The point is not puritanism; it is attention: where one sits determines what one hears, and what one hears becomes who one is. The beat of לֹא keeps time until v. 2 supplies the alternative rhythm.

Verse 2

“כִּי אִם”—“but rather”—is the poem’s hinge. Desire turns toward instruction: “בְּתוֹרַת יְהוָה חֶפְצוֹ” (“his delight is in the Torah of YHWH”). The noun חֵפֶץ (`ḤEF-tso`) is more than preference; it is relish. Torah here is not a statute-book but instruction (tôrāh) that forms a life. The next clause shifts from the objective to the possessed: “וּבְתוֹרָתוֹ יֶהְגֶּה” (“and in his Torah he meditates”). Rashi’s famous gloss—“at first God’s, then his”—honors the verse’s delicate grammar: ownership here is not sovereignty but interiority.

The verb יֶהְגֶּה (`yeh-GEH`) is tactile. BDB lists “moan, growl, utter, muse,” and the sound echoes the motion it names. The image is not of silent study but of murmuring. The adverbial phrase “יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה” (“day and night”) is a merism that signals constancy rather than literal 24/7 practice; compare Joshua 1:8, where the same verb and timeframe commission Israel’s leader. The figurative database shows the phrase’s idiomatic scope across Scripture (e.g., Genesis 8:22; Psalms 55:11): “day and night” marks a habit that frames a life.

A subtle doctrinal precision: the psalmist does not say “in commandments he meditates,” but “in Torah.” Instruction includes commands, but also narrative and promise. Meiri hears here a twofold perfection—study and practice. Malbim adds a moral interior: one does good not for gain but because it is the good; to delight in Torah is to be disinterested in reward. Torah Temimah relays an austere Talmudic riff (Kiddushin 32a) on whether Torah becomes “the sage’s,” concluding (and then qualifying) that what seems “his” remains God’s gift—an elegant counterpoint to “his Torah.”

Liturgically, the line surfaces when Jewish communities need to declare what orders time. On Yom Kippur night, as all other delights are set aside, the congregation puts this delight in its mouth. The psalm teaches a quiet art: to make the words you love your own, you must speak them until they do not merely inform you but form you.

Verse 3

“וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל”—“he will be like a tree transplanted.” The passive participle matters: like vines carefully set (cf. Ezekiel 19:10), this life is positioned. The site is “עַל־פַלְגֵי־מָיִם” (al-pal-gēy-māyim), “by channels of water,” a term from the root פ-ל-ג (“divide”), used of irrigation and, poetically, of the streams that gladden God’s city (Psalm 46:4). Ancient readers understood the practicalities: in a Mediterranean climate, prosperity comes not from romance with a stream but from reliable channels. The metaphor honors habit and husbandry.

Three results follow in a settled cadence:
- “אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ” (“which gives its fruit in its season”): “season” (עֵת) is the correction to our impatience. Fruit is not constant; it is reliable. 
- “וְעָלֵהוּ לֹא־יִבּוֹל” (“its leaf does not wither”): a picture of sustained vitality even between harvests. Ezekiel 47:12 echoes this phrase for the trees nourished by the temple river.
- “וְכֹל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ” (“and all he does prospers”): a line sometimes read as a blithe guarantee. Its own context qualifies it: “all he does” within a life irrigated by Torah; “prospers” (יַצְלִיחַ) as in “comes to good effect,” not necessarily “becomes wealthy.”

Ibn Ezra collects readings that apply “prospers” to the person (most likely) or even to the “leaf”—a midrashic hint of how readers savored the image’s parts. Rashi, with memorable warmth, says “even the waste” (פסולת) of such a person—their casual conversation—proves useful, a way of honoring how Torah-speech can season all speech.

The figure has a deep biblical life. Jeremiah 17:7–8 uses a similar tree to teach heat-resilience, not just fruitfulness; our psalm adds the agricultural specificity of channels and timing. The figurative database confirms the frequency of tree metaphors but also their flexibility: sometimes the point is rootedness (Psalm 92:13–15), sometimes resilience (Jeremiah 17), sometimes fruit (here).

Rabbinic imagination even brought the line into human cycles. Torah Temimah, citing Bavli (Ketubot 62b; Bava Kamma 82a), links “fruit in its season” to the conjugal “season” of Erev Shabbat—a reminder that “seasoned” fruitfulness includes love’s rhythms. In liturgy, the line blossoms each Shemini Atzeret in Tefillat Geshem—“בֵּרַכְתּו כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל”—where Israel begs for rain and, by implication, for lives set by waters that do not fail.

Verse 4

“לֹא־כֵן הָרְשָׁעִים”—“Not so the wicked.” The brevity is part of the argument. The righteous merited an extended, architected simile; the wicked are dispatched with a single, standard picture: “כַּמֹּץ אֲשֶׁר־תִּדְּפֶנּוּ רוּחַ” (“like chaff the wind drives away”). Chaff (מֹּץ) is the fine husk; the verb נָדַף (nadaph) means “to drive/scatter,” not drift. Elsewhere the psalmist prays his enemies “be as chaff before the wind” (Psalm 35:5); Second Isaiah uses the same threshing-floor physics for routed kings (Isaiah 41:2). The figurative database shows how often this image carries the same load: worthlessness, vulnerability, dispersal.

Radak adds a shrewdly agrarian touch: chaff not only lacks weight but annoys—blowing into eyes and houses. Wickedness is not merely empty; it is irksome and injurious in its movement. Ibn Ezra contrasts “grain” (דָּגָן) that “stands” with chaff that does not—preparing the wordplay of v. 5. The Septuagint follows suit with an equally brief “ὡς ὁ χνοῦς” (“like thistledown”), preserving the gust.

This compression does not preach instant downfall. It says: without roots, nothing resists the elements. That is why v. 3’s channels matter, and why v. 2’s murmuring matters: if you would be more than light debris in a wind, be transplanted near a source. The psalm trusts the physics of the moral world. It does not always happen at noon on a Tuesday; it happens.

Verse 5

“עַל־כֵּן”—“Therefore”—draws a line from character to consequence. “לֹא־יָקֻמוּ רְשָׁעִים בַּמִּשְׁפָּט” (“the wicked will not stand/endure in the judgment”). The verb קוּם (qum) means here to be upheld or established; it is the judicial opposite of collapse. The irony from v. 1 now comes due: the righteous refused to “stand” in the path of sinners; now sinners cannot “stand” when the tribunal convenes. The “judgment” (מִשְׁפָּט, mishpat) can be read as either the daily operation of God’s order or the final reckoning (the tradition holds both possibilities in view). Ibn Ezra and Radak gloss it as “day of death/Day of Judgment”—language that gave the verse eschatological edge.

The twin clause completes the exclusion: “וְחַטָּאִים בַּעֲדַת צַדִּיקִים” (“nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous”). The noun עֵדָה (‘ēdāh) is a gathered company, often “by appointment” (BDB), not a random crowd. Malbim suggests a distinction: the “wicked” cannot stand even in their own case; “sinners,” who might plead human frailty, still cannot join the sharpened standard of the righteous assembly.

The line resonated in halakhic and aggadic debates: Torah Temimah cites Sanhedrin 107b on those “who do not stand in judgment” and those excluded from the righteous assembly. The verse’s social imagination matters: flourishing is not a solo act but a membership. To be “transplanted” (v. 3) is to be set not only near water but among a people. That is why communities sing this line on Yom Kippur night. It solemnly names both the dignity of judgment and the consolation of belonging.

Verse 6

The final couplet is antithetic parallelism at its purest: “כִּי־יוֹדֵעַ יְהוָה דֶּרֶךְ צַדִּיקִים // וְדֶרֶךְ רְשָׁעִים תֹּאבֵד.” The second colon opposes the first to clarify the claim. “Knows” (יוֹדֵעַ, yôdēa‘) here is covenantal knowing—recognition with regard. Compare Deuteronomy 34:10 (“whom YHWH knew,” of Moses), or Psalms 144:3 (“what is man that you know him?”). Radak glosses: “recognizes and attends, to do them good.” To be “known” is to be kept in view.

The “way” (דֶּרֶךְ) frames the psalm—appearing in v. 1 and here—an inclusio that says life is a path, not a pose. The wicked “way” perishes (תֹּאבֵד, toved), the same verb used of idols and hopes that vanish (e.g., Job 8:13): not merely “fails to prosper,” but runs to nothing. The Septuagint’s “γινώσκει κύριος ὁδὸν δικαίων … ὁδὸς ἀσεβῶν ἀπολεῖται” keeps the antithesis crisp: known versus lost.

The line is not a threat but a map. It teaches the reader how to read the rest of the Psalter: to trust that the path God “knows” has a future even through lament, and that the path God does not “know” has within it the seeds of its end. In Pirkei Avot’s spirit, one could say: the choice of counsel (v. 1) is already a choice of future (v. 6). The psalm insists that God’s knowledge is not the chill omniscience of a camera but the warm attention of a gardener who knows where he has set the tree. That is why the last word is perishing—not because God crushes, but because rootlessness does the work itself.

Definitions in-line: antithetic parallelism (second line opposes first to clarify meaning); inclusio (a framing repetition); “know” in Hebrew often signals covenant regard, not bare cognition; LXX (Septuagint) preserves the logic of the opposition.

Finally, the verse is a benediction the Psalter places over every prayer to come. The book will traverse rage and illness, exile and coronation. Psalm 1 does not deny the weather; it points to the channels.
