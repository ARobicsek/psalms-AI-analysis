**Verse 1**

אַשְׁרֵי־הָאִישׁ אֲשֶׁר לֹא הָלַךְ בַּעֲצַת רְשָׁעִים; וּבְדֶרֶךְ חַטָּאִים לֹא עָמָד; וּבְמוֹשַׁב לֵצִים לֹא יָשָׁב׃

The verse is built as a staircase—a three-step anaphora (repeated opening) of לֹא (“not”), climbing through motion verbs: הָלַךְ (“walked”), עָמָד (“stood”), יָשָׁב (“sat”). The progression is theatrical: first movement toward, then pause within, then residence among. Ibn Ezra reports the classic view that each verb intensifies entanglement; Rashi aligns the social settings accordingly. The three spheres—עֲצָה (counsel), דֶּרֶךְ (way), מוֹשָׁב (seat)—move from the intellectual to the practical to the habitual. The blessed person’s “happiness” is first defined by refusals.

The three human labels sharpen the threat. רְשָׁעִים (“wicked”) in the Psalter are not hapless sinners; they pursue a path (דֶּרֶךְ) in contest with God. חַטָּאִים (“sinners”) miss the mark, by impulse or negligence. לֵצִים (“scoffers”), chiefly in Proverbs, are those who despise correction: “אַל־תּוֹכַח לֵץ פֶּן־יִשְׂנָאֶךָ; הוֹכַח לְחָכָם וְיֶאֱהָבֶךָ” (Proverbs 9:8: “Do not reprove a scoffer, lest he hate you; rebuke a wise man, and he will love you”). The Septuagint’s odd “seat of pestilences” (λοιμῶν) signals an ancient difficulty with לֵצִים, but the Masoretic reading, anchored by Proverbs, is secure.

“Walk/stand/sit” is the Bible’s idiom for a life’s moral course. “To walk in God’s ways” is the Deuteronomic ideal: “לָלֶכֶת בְּכָל־דְּרָכָיו” (Deuteronomy 10:12: “to walk in all His ways”). Conversely, “walking after other gods” marks apostasy: “לָלֶכֶת אַחֲרֵי אֱלֹהִים אֲחֵרִים” (Deuteronomy 28:14). Psalm 1 domesticates that idiom. “Counsel/way/seat” are not abstractions; they are the places where we think, move, and belong.

Sound amplifies sense. Read aloud, the triple negation creates a pulse—לֹא … לֹא … לֹא—that hammers in a fence line. The initial לֹא (and its two echoes) are syntactic posts marking a boundary the blessed one refuses to cross. Classical Jewish pedagogy turned this into positive instruction: the Mishnah (Avot) warns that a table with no words of Torah between companions becomes a “seat of scoffers,” citing our line in full. Psalm 1’s “no” becomes the liturgical yes of purposeful speech.

Finally, “אַשְׁרֵי” is plural in form, which Radak reads as a “collection of felicities.” The psalm is not promising a single reward but a way of life that accrues goods—moral, emotional, communal—because it avoids an ecology that corrodes them.

(Definitions: anaphora = deliberate repetition at the start of clauses; idiom of “walk/stand/sit” = conventional biblical metaphor for conduct.)

**Verse 2**

כִּי אִם־בְּתוֹרַת יְהוָה חֶפְצוֹ; וּבְתוֹרָתוֹ יֶהְגֶּה יוֹמָם וָלָיְלָה׃

The adversative כִּי אִם (“but rather”) pivots from negation to appetite. חֵפֶץ (“delight, desire”) names an affect, not an obligation. The blessed one’s posture is not stoic avoidance but positive pleasure “in the LORD’s Torah.” The second colon completes the thought (a classic example of what modern scholars call “synthetic parallelism”): what delight sounds like is a murmur. “וּבְתוֹרָתוֹ יֶהְגֶּה”—the verb הָגָה is onomatopoetic. Isaiah uses it for a lion’s growl (“כַּאֲשֶׁר יֶהְגֶּה הָאַרְיֵה,” 31:4) and for the necromancer’s mutterings (8:19). In study, the same verb denotes recitation under the breath: “לֹא־יָמוּשׁ … מִפִּיךָ; וְהָגִיתָ בּוֹ יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה” (Joshua 1:8: “This book… shall not depart from your mouth; you shall meditate on it day and night”). Jewish learning was audible; Psalm 1 hears it.

Two subtle devices enrich the line. First, the merism “day and night” signals scope: not literally every minute, but habitually, regularly. Second, the possessive shift from “תּוֹרַת יְהוָה” to “בְּתוֹרָתוֹ” (“his Torah”) is theological. The Talmud famously infers: “בתחילה נקראת תורת ה׳; ולבסוף נקראת תורתו” (Avodah Zarah 19a). Delight leads to intimacy; murmuring produces ownership. Meiri notes the same: after one has learned it, “it is called his Torah,” because its words have become his thought-world.

The phrase “כִּי אִם” in Hebrew is more than “but”; it is “but on the contrary.” Psalm 1 is not offering a grim austerity. It is a trade: declining the quick hit of scorn yields the slow joy of study. R. Shlomo Alkabetz’s Lecha Dodi later made that liturgical: “לִקְרַאת שַׁבָּת לְכוּ וְנֵלְכָה”—walk away from work-world cynicism; walk toward a murmured delight.

(Definitions: synthetic parallelism = a two-part line in which the second half completes or advances the first; merism = naming two extremes to suggest the whole.)

**Verse 3**

וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם; אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ; וְעָלֵהוּ לֹא־יִבּוֹל; וְכֹל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ׃

An emblematic simile anchors the psalm’s rhetoric: “like a tree, transplanted beside channels of water.” שָׁתוּל, as BDB notes, suggests deliberate placement, not wild growth. Jeremiah reproduces it: “וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־מַיִם” (17:8). Psalm 92 internalizes it to the sanctuary: “שְׁתוּלִים בְּבֵית יְהוָה; בְּחַצְרוֹת אֱלֹהֵינוּ יַפְרִיחוּ” (92:14: “Planted in the house of YHWH; they flourish in the courts of our God”). In Psalm 1, the “streams” (פַּלְגֵי) are probably irrigation channels (cf. Psalm 46:5: “נָהָר פְּלָגָיו יְשַׂמְּחוּ עִיר אֱלֹהִים”—“A river whose streams gladden God’s city”). The gardener is implicit; the agency is God’s.

Three clauses unpack the image. First, productivity with timing: “יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ” (“yields its fruit in its season”). This is not frenetic maximalism but aptness. Radak observes that a rain-fed tree delays in drought, but a channel-fed tree fruits on time. Second, unfading vitality: “וְעָלֵהוּ לֹא־יִבּוֹל” (“its leaf does not wither”). The verb נבל (“to wither”) elsewhere marks human fragility (“וַאֲנִי כָּעֵשֶׂב אִיבָשׁ,” Psalm 102:12: “I wither like grass”). Here the negation asserts durability without triumphalism. Rabbinic imagination, noticing even the leaves, said, “Even the ‘chaff’ of sages is useful—שִׂיחָתָן של תַּלְמִידֵי חֲכָמִים צְרִיכָה לִמּוּד” (Avodah Zarah 19b): even their casual talk enlightens. Third, comprehensive flourishing: “וְכֹל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ” (“all that he does prospers”). The idiom recalls Joseph: “וַיְהִי יְהוָה אֶת־יוֹסֵף… וְכֹל אֲשֶׁר הוּא עֹשֶׂה ה׳ מַצְלִיחַ בְּיָדוֹ” (Genesis 39:2–3: “The LORD was with Joseph… and all that he did the LORD made prosper in his hand”). In the world of Psalm 1, success is not luck but rootedness.

Liturgically, this image has been recruited for both rain and renewal. In Tefillat Geshem (Shemini Atzeret), the community prays: “בֵּרַכְתּוֹ כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל פַּלְגֵי מַיִם”—“You blessed him like a tree planted by streams.” In some communities the verse accompanies Rosh Hashanah Kiddush, a blessing at the hinge-point of the year. The point is not prosperity gospel; it is stability: fruit in season, a leaf that does not crisp under heat, work that is not wasted.

(Definition: emblematic simile = a “this is like that” figure that carries moral or theological freight.)

**Verse 4**

לֹא־כֵן הָרְשָׁעִים; כִּי אִם־כַּמֹּץ אֲשֶׁר־תִּדְּפֶנּוּ רוּחַ׃

The antithesis is total: “Not so the wicked.” No elaboration follows, only a single clause: “like chaff which the wind drives away.” The aesthetic asymmetry—lush arboreal portrait versus bare waste—embodies the theological claim: substance endures; insubstance cannot hold description.

Chaff (מֹץ) is a favored biblical vehicle for worthlessness under judgment. Isaiah: “כְּמֹץ הָרִים לִפְנֵי־רוּחַ” (17:13: “like chaff of the mountains before the wind”). Psalms: “יִהְיוּ כְּמֹץ לִפְנֵי־רוּחַ” (35:5: “let them be as chaff before the wind”). The threshing floor, where grain is separated from husk, becomes a moral stage: the wicked are weightless. The verb נָדַף (“drive away, scatter”) underscores ease: nothing must be exerted; the wind does the work.

Radak notes that chaff not only fails to feed; it can injure as it blows—getting in eyes, fouling gardens. Evil in the psalms is never neutral. Yet notice the restraint: there is no gloating, no fire here (contrast Malachi 3:19: “כִּי הִנֵּה הַיּוֹם בָּא בֹּעֵר כַּתַּנּוּר… וְהָיוּ… קַשׁ”—“the day is coming, burning like an oven… they shall be stubble”). Psalm 1’s interest is ontological. One way is real enough to be described; the other falls apart as you look at it.

Sound again assists: after the gentle liquids of the tree-line, this verse is clipped, with the guttural ק–כ (k) in “כַּמֹּץ” and “כִּי אִם,” the sudden stop of the period after “Not so.” The poet has no more to say; that is the point.

**Verse 5**

עַל־כֵּן לֹא־יָקֻמוּ רְשָׁעִים בַּמִּשְׁפָּט; וְחַטָּאִים בַּעֲדַת צַדִּיקִים׃

“Therefore”—a judgment follows from the images. “The wicked will not stand in the judgment.” קוּם (“to arise, stand”) is the biblical verb for legal standing: “לֹא־יָקוּם עֵד אֶחָד” (Deuteronomy 19:15: “a single witness shall not stand,” i.e., does not establish a case). Here the wicked fail to “stand” when cases are heard. The second clause turns from court to congregation: “nor sinners in the assembly (עֵדָה) of the righteous.” In the Psalter, “assembly” and its twin “congregation” (קָהָל) often mean the worshipping community: “אֲהַלֶּלְךָ בְּקָהָל רָב” (Psalm 22:26: “I will praise You in the great congregation”); “עֲדַת־קְדֹשִׁים” (Psalm 89:6: “assembly of the holy ones”). Psalm 1 uses both layers: forensic and liturgical.

Medieval exegesis sometimes hears an eschatological overtone. Radak glosses “the Day of Judgment,” understanding “will not rise” in the sense of no share in resurrection. The Talmud stages a debate on precisely this (Sanhedrin 107b), reading our line as excluding both Sodomites and generation of the Flood “from the judgment” and “from the assembly of the righteous.” The psalm itself refuses speculative timetable; its grammar paints the moral: there is a community shaped by Torah-delight, and scoffers do not find footing there.

Note that the labels from verse 1 reappear, but not the לֵצִים (“scoffers”). The scoffer’s penalty, in wisdom literature, is often solitary exclusion (Proverbs 22:10: “גָּרֵשׁ לֵץ—וַיֵּצֵא מָדוֹן” / “Cast out the scoffer, and strife will go out”). Psalm 1 observes the same sociology: mockery corrodes communal worship.

(Definitions: forensic idiom = language drawn from law court; עֵדָה/קָהָל = technical terms for gathered community.)

**Verse 6**

כִּי־יוֹדֵעַ יְהוָה דֶּרֶךְ צַדִּיקִים; וְדֶרֶךְ רְשָׁעִים תֹּאבֵד׃

The final “for” grounds the whole psalm in God’s posture. The hinge-verb is “know” (יָדַע). In covenant parlance, to “know” a person is to recognize and regard them: “רַק אֶתְכֶם יָדַעְתִּי” (Amos 3:2: “You only have I known”) and “כִּי יְדַעְתִּיו” (Genesis 18:19: “For I have known him”). Radak glosses: “מכיר ומשגיח להיטיב להם” (“He recognizes and watches to do them good”). Malbim heightens the claim: God’s “knowing” adheres to what is eternal; the righteous “way,” joined to God’s life, endures.

The grammar contrasts elegant agency. The righteous way is the object of God’s active knowing; the wicked way “perishes” (תֹּאבֵד), an intransitive that assigns no agent. In other words: evil does not need to be smitten to end; it collapses. Psalm 112 observes the same when it says, “תַאֲוַת רְשָׁעִים תֹּאבֵד” (112:10: “The desire of the wicked will perish”). Psalm 1 applies that to a whole derekh, a “way.” The poem’s inclusio—דֶּרֶךְ appears in v. 1 and twice here—frames the choice and its end. A “way” known by God is a real path; a “way” without that recognition, however viable for a season, comes to nothing.

One last, quiet juxtaposition situates Psalm 1 beside Psalm 2. The same root הָגָה (murmur) heads both: here, Torah-delight (1:2); there, politics in revolt (2:1: “לָמָּה רָגְשׁוּ גוֹיִם… וְיֶהְגּוּ רִיק” / “Why do nations rage… and the peoples plot emptiness?”). The Psalter opens by asking: What will you murmur? Whose “knowing” do you seek? Psalm 1’s answer is minimalist and maximal: choose the way that God attends to—and you will become attendable.

(Definitions: inclusio = an “envelope” formed by repeating a key term at start and end; intransitive verb = a verb without a direct object; covenant “knowing” = recognition that confers relation, not mere awareness.)
