**Verse 1**

“Happy the man who has not walked in the counsel of the wicked, nor stood in the path of sinners, nor sat in the seat of scoffers.”

The opening word, `’ashrei`, is a plural of intensity: not a mood but a state of flourishing (Radak: “many good things”). The grammar builds a staircase. Each rung is a refusal: “has not walked… has not stood… has not sat.” The nouns track the verbs. `‘Atzat` (counsel) is advice you can still ignore; `derek` (path) is a chosen course; `moshav` (seat) is a place you settle and a platform of influence. In wisdom literature, these are not separate sins so much as a deepening posture. Ibn Ezra notes a complementary angle: the “wicked” are themselves unstable; the walker risks being drawn into their drift.

The last group, `letzim`, is not a throwaway insult. In Proverbs the `lets` is a technical villain: the mocker who rejects instruction (Prov 1:22; 9:7–8; 15:12). The LXX renders “seat of scoffers” as “seat of pestilent [persons]” (ἐπὶ καθέδρα λοιμῶν), converting mockery into contagion. It is a translation by interpretation: moral derision spreads like disease.

The line also works in the ear. The Hebrew recitation (see the phonetic line) hammers the triple `lo’` (`LŌ'` hā-`LAKH`… `LŌ'` `ʿāMĀDH`… `LŌ'` `yāSHĀV`). This is anaphora—repeating the same word at the start of successive phrases—and the stresses land where the ethic lives: on the refusal and the act. What we are told to admire in verse 1 is self‑governance: a capacity to say no to a setting that will shape you if you let it.

The imagery of “way” and “walking” is biblical idiom for moral life. Deuteronomy is full of it: “Follow only the path… that you may thrive” (Deut 5:30), and negatively, “turn away from the path” as a metaphor for idolatry (11:28). Our psalm’s last line will circle back to `derek` (way), creating an inclusio—a frame that keeps us thinking in terms of paths.

Finally, “happy” is not the same as “untroubled.” The Psalter will spend far more ink on trouble than on ease. Psalm 1 sets not the weather but the direction: what you attend to, what you refuse, where you plant your life.

Technical notes:
- Anaphora: repetition of `lo’` (“not”) creates rhythmic emphasis.
- Inclusio: `derek` appears in vv. 1 and 6, bracketing the poem.
- LXX: λοιμῶν (“pestilent [ones]”) for `letzim` marks mockery as socially infectious.

**Verse 2**

“But rather, in the teaching of the LORD is his delight, and on his teaching he murmurs day and night.”

The adversative `ki ’im` (“but rather”) turns the thought from avoidance to appetite. The core claim is about desire: `ḥefetz` denotes pleasure and longing, not mere compliance. The object is `torat YHWH`—the LORD’s instruction. “Torah” here is not a statute book only; it is the teaching that shapes a life.

The verse’s second half delights in a grammatical pivot: “and on his teaching he meditates (`yehgeh`).” The rabbis noticed and coined a maxim: “At first it is God’s Torah; after one has labored in it, it becomes his” (Avodah Zarah 19a). The Talmud even drew halakhic implications from this possessive (Kiddushin 32a): if Torah can be called “his,” does a teacher’s honor yield? You need not enter that debate to grasp the literary point. The pronoun signals internalization. What was external becomes native speech.

The verb `yehgeh` is onomatopoetic in the lexicon: a low murmur, the voiced recitation of someone committing words to memory (BDB; cf. Josh 1:8). Biblical meditation is vocal. The phrase “day and night” is a merism, a Hebrew way to say “always.” Connected texts confirm the pattern: God guides Israel “day and night” in the wilderness (Exod 13:21), and Joshua is told to recite Torah “day and night” in order to act faithfully (Josh 1:8). Psalm 1 borrows that cadence to describe a civilian, not a general. The democratization is striking: devotion once associated with leaders and priests becomes a lay vocation.

“Delight” carries its own corrective. Malbim insists that the good is done because it is good, not as a calculated bid for reward. The psalm’s promise of flourishing will arrive in the following verse; the desire comes first. Love of instruction precedes any outcome.

Technical notes:
- Merism: “day and night” = all the time.
- `yehgeh`: murmured recitation, not silent musing (cf. Isa 31:4; Josh 1:8).
- Reception: “God’s Torah” → “his Torah” in rabbinic interpretation (Avodah Zarah 19a; Kiddushin 32a).

**Verse 3**

“He shall be like a tree transplanted by channels of water, that yields its fruit in its season; its leaf does not wither; and whatever he does prospers.”

Every word of the simile is chosen. `Shatul` is not wild growth; it is a transplant (BDB), the gardener’s act of deliberate placement. The site is `al‑palgei mayim`—beside divided watercourses. These are irrigation channels (note the plural), not a single stream that might run dry. In the Levant, irrigation is security.

The figurative pattern is widespread. Jeremiah 17:8 likely echoes our psalm: the blessed one is “like a tree planted by water,” not fearing heat, its leaves ever green. Ezekiel 19:10 speaks of a vine planted by abundant waters. In the figurative database, “tree by water” consistently signals stability and sustained vitality in arid conditions. Our psalm adds three effects, a small staircase of blessing: fruit comes “in its season” (timely productivity); the leaf does not wither (ongoing vitality under stress); “whatever he does prospers” (general efficacy).

That last clause is easily misread. `Yatsliaḥ` means “come to good effect,” not “hit every market high.” Its paired text, Joshua 1:8, is helpful: the promise of “success” comes not as a hedge against adversity but as the reliable outcome of aligning action with instruction. Within the Psalter, packed with complaint, “prosper” cannot mean immunity from loss. It means rootedness that bears in season, and endurance that does not go brittle.

Traditional commentary noticed a human extension of the tree: even the “leaf” is good for something (Rashi), a way of saying that the righteous person’s speech and minor acts are of use. The Meiri extends the image to teaching: fruit “in season” is the ability to nourish others once one has first been rooted oneself—a humane rhythm that the rabbis elaborated, even in their scheduling of scholars’ domestic obligations (Ketubot 62b).

Technical notes:
- `shatul`: “transplanted,” implying deliberate placement.
- `palgei mayim`: “channels” or “rivulets”—secured irrigation.
- Figurative parallels: Jer 17:8; Ezek 19:10; cf. Deut 32:2 for nourishing water imagery.
- Canonical echo: “prosper/succeed” (`yatsliaḥ`) links to Josh 1:8.

**Verse 4**

“Not so the wicked! Rather, they are like chaff which the wind drives away.”

The reversal is abrupt. The Hebrew `lo’‑khen`—“not so!”—is a full stop. Rhetorically, the psalm’s asymmetry does the work: three verses to the righteous; four quick words to the wicked, who are immediately shifted into a simile and blown offstage.

Chaff (`motz`) is more than refuse; it is the lightest possible thing on a threshing floor. In biblical usage it marks worthlessness and instability and is often yoked to scenes of judgment. The figurative database shows the pattern: “Let them be like chaff before the wind” (Ps 35:5); the nations are “like chaff on the hills before the wind” (Isa 17:13). Our verse keeps the same grammar of weight and motion.

Agency is compressed into a single verb: `tidd’fennu` (Hiphil—causative—of `dāphāh`), “drives him away,” suggesting not a gentle wafting but a forcible expulsion. The agent is the `ruaḥ`: wind—or spirit. Hebrew leaves the constructive ambiguity in place. Sometimes the wind is simply wind; sometimes it is the breath of God (Exod 15:8). Either way, what lacks weight does not remain.

Ibn Ezra draws a tight contrast: the righteous are like grain that stands; the wicked are like the fine waste at winnowing. Radak notes chaff’s petty nuisance—dust that stings the eyes—and its lack of use. The psalm’s sound matches its economy; where the tree grew in layered clauses, the chaff is one short line: named, gusted, gone.

Technical notes:
- Figurative parallels: Ps 35:5; Isa 17:13.
- `ruaḥ`: wind/spirit—deliberate ambiguity.
- Hiphil `tidd’fennu`: causative “drive away,” intensifying the image.

**Verse 5**

“Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.”

The “therefore” ties verse 5 to the image of chaff. What cannot remain on the threshing floor cannot stand in court. The verb `qum` (“stand”) here carries a legal sense: to “stand” is to have one’s case established, to be validated. Deuteronomy uses the idiom: “A matter shall stand [`yakum`] by the testimony of two or three witnesses” (Deut 19:15). The wicked cannot “stand” in that sense; they lack legal standing before divine scrutiny.

“Judgment” (`mishpat`) here reads as “the judgment,” a definite proceeding rather than a vague principle. Classical Jewish readers debated its timing—at death? the end of days?—but the point is functional: the wicked cannot maintain their cause when weighed.

The second clause shifts from tribunal to fellowship: `ba‘adat tsaddiqim`, “in the assembly of the righteous.” The noun `‘edah` is familiar in Priestly texts for Israel’s congregation; in the Psalter it can mark the worshiping community (Ps 111:1) or the society of the faithful. Here the contrast is pointed. The righteous have a congregation; the wicked are solitary in their collapse. Malbim nuances the two classes: “wicked” as those hardened in malice; “sinners” as those overtaken by appetite. Even the latter, he argues, might find excuses when judged alone, but they cannot stand when measured against a company who overcame the same desires.

The syntactic asymmetry across verses 5–6 is instructive. God is named as knowing the righteous way; no agent is named for the wicked’s end. Some collapses are self‑inflicted. A way without root falls of its own scant weight.

Technical notes:
- Legal idiom: `qum` (“stand”) = have standing/validity (Deut 19:15).
- `‘edah`: assembly/congregation, here the fellowship of the vindicated.
- Atmosphere: forensic (court) to communal (assembly).

**Verse 6**

“For the LORD knows the way of the righteous; but the way of the wicked shall perish.”

The conclusion is all economy. `Yada‘` (“knows”) in biblical idiom means more than awareness; it is covenantal regard and ongoing care. “I have known Abraham” (Gen 18:19) signals choice and charge; “You only have I known” (Amos 3:2) marks exclusive relationship. Applied to “the way,” the verb suggests more than God’s knowledge of persons. God attends to paths. A life ordered toward God is held in God’s regard.

The second colon is deliberately impersonal. No subject acts upon the wicked way. It “perishes” (`tō’ved`) of itself. The psalm thus avoids a cartoon of retribution. It suggests something more sober: a path severed from reality is entropic. It unwinds.

Two framing moves repay notice. First, “way” (`derek`) appears in verse 1 (“path of sinners”) and here, creating an inclusio that keeps the poem’s horizon practical. Psalm 1 is not about feelings in the abstract but about a manner of life. Second, Psalm 1’s final cadence prepares the reader for Psalm 2’s clash of powers: the local choice of a way under God (Psalm 1) opens into the global contest of ways (Psalm 2). Both end with `’ashrei`, “happy”—personal flourishing and political refuge braided into one entrance arch.

The theology is bracing in its simplicity. Righteousness requires maintenance—cultivation, irrigation, attention—and the psalm names God as the one who sees and sustains that way. Wickedness requires no actor to destroy it. It burns itself out. That is less dramatic than thunderbolts, and perhaps more frightening.

Technical notes:
- `yada‘`: covenantal “know” = attend, care for, commit (Gen 18:19; Amos 3:2).
- Inclusio: `derek` in vv. 1 and 6 frames the poem.
- Asymmetry of agency: active divine care vs. impersonal perishing.

References: Gen 18:19; Amos 3:2.
