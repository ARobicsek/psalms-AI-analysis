## Introduction
PART 1: Main Introduction Essay (about 1100 words)
Psalm 1 does not so much introduce the Psalter as instruct us how to read it. It teaches us to see prayer, lament, thanksgiving, and royal hope through the old, stubborn wisdom contrast of “two ways.” The psalm’s brevity is deceptive. Its metaphors are concrete, its syntax taut, and its argument unfolds in the interplay of lines—a hallmark of biblical poetry, which advances thought by parallel cola (a “colon” is a single poetic line) that confirm, sharpen, or oppose one another.
The opening beatitude, אַשְׁרֵי־הָאִישׁ (`'ash-RĒY hā-'IYSH`)—“Happy/blessed is the person”—is a plural noun (אַשְׁרֵי) that, as Radak notes, suggests a fullness of goods; happiness is never a single stroke of luck but a composite life. The psalm begins by drawing a silhouette: the righteous is first described by what he declines to do. Three short clauses form a staircase of refusal: “who has not walked in the counsel of the wicked, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of scoffers” (v. 1). The verbs “walked/stood/sat” (הָלַךְ/עָמַד/יָשַׁב) trace a movement from casual exposure to rooted belonging. The three groups—רְשָׁעִים (rə-shā‘īm, “the wicked”), חַטָּאִים (ḥaṭṭā’īm, “sinners”), and לֵצִים (lētsīm, “scoffers”)—span active malice, habitual failure, and corrosive cynicism. BDB remarks that the lēts, the “scoffer,” delights in scorning and resists correction; the Septuagint’s choice of λοιμοί (“pestilent ones”) widens the damage from private vice to public contagion.
Even the sound underscores the stance. With the repetition of the emphatic לֹא (lo, “not”)—“לֹא הָלַךְ … לֹא עָמָד … לֹא יָשָׁב”—the Hebrew makes negation a beat. In the provided phonetic line, each לֹא bears the stress (`LŌ' … LŌ' … LŌ'`), giving the refusal a drum-like cadence. The first wisdom lesson is restraint: flourishing here depends as much on what one declines as on what one desires.
The pivot comes with כִּי אִם (ki 'im, “but rather,” v. 2), an adversative that ushers in a positive posture: “his delight is in the Torah of YHWH, and in his Torah he meditates day and night.” “Torah” (תוֹרָה, tôrāh) means instruction—divine teaching—more than “law code.” The subtle shift from “the Torah of YHWH” (בְּתוֹרַת ה׳) to “his Torah” (וּבְתוֹרָתוֹ) received a famous gloss in Rashi: what begins as God’s instruction becomes “his” through toil; teaching internalized becomes a life. The verb יֶהְגֶּה (`yeh-GEH`) is onomatopoetic: to mutter, muse, murmur. The psalm does not picture silent reading but audible rumination, lips moving—and not sporadically, but “day and night,” a merism (naming two poles to evoke the whole) for steady habit. This is the wisdom answer to the negative company of v. 1: the righteous seats himself under teaching.
From habit to image: “He will be like a tree transplanted beside channels of water” (וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַלְגֵי־מָיִם, v. 3). “Transplanted” (שָׁתוּל, shātûl) matters; BDB glosses the root as “to transplant.” This tree did not chance upon a stream; it was set by design. The “channels” (פַלְגֵי, palgēy) are divided runnels—agricultural irrigation, not a romantic brook. In other words, this is cultivation as much as nature, a figure for a life intentionally positioned under steady nourishment. The fruit arrives “in its season” (בְּעִתּוֹ), which rescues the verse from naïveté: this is not a promise of perpetual harvest but of reliable rhythms. Even the leaves “do not wither” (לֹא־יִבּוֹל), a touch the rabbis read with some whimsy: even a scholar’s casual talk proves useful (Rashi). 
The image reverberates across Israel’s Scriptures. Jeremiah 17:7–8 borrows the tree-by-water figure but emphasizes drought-proof trust; Psalm 1 stresses placement by channels and seasonal fruitfulness. The figurative database confirms how pervasive such arboreal metaphors are for stability and nourishment; here they are sharpened by the agricultural specificity.
The wicked receive less ink but not less force: “Not so the wicked! Rather, they are like chaff that the wind drives away” (v. 4). Chaff (מֹּץ, mots) is the fine, worthless husk separated on a threshing floor. The verb נָדַף (nadaph, “drive away”) suggests violent dispersal. The Bible’s imagination reaches for this picture whenever it wants to render enemies or evildoers insubstantial (Psalms 35:5; Isaiah 41:2). The psalm’s own rhetoric enacts this weightlessness: where the righteous gets an extended, layered simile, the wicked vanish in a single gust. Brevity is meaning.
From image to verdict, the psalm turns juridical: “Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous” (v. 5). The verb “stand” (קוּם, qum) in judicial contexts means “endure” or “hold one’s ground.” There is dark wit here: the righteous refused to “stand” in the way of sinners (v. 1); now the wicked cannot “stand” when judgment turns its face upon them. The “assembly” (עֲדַת, ‘ădat) of the righteous is a gathered company “by appointment” (BDB), a community of belonging that sinners cannot inhabit. The rabbis took such phrases with eschatological seriousness and practical bite: Torah Temimah cites debates about who rises in judgment and who belongs among the righteous—this psalm was not read as moral wallpaper but as a chart of ultimate belonging.
The last line states the theology that underwrites all the imagery: “For YHWH knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish” (v. 6). “Knows” (יוֹדֵעַ, yôdēa‘) in biblical idiom reaches beyond awareness to covenant regard—recognition that entails care (Radak glosses: “recognizes and attends, to do them good”). The psalm’s form here is antithetic parallelism (a device in which the second colon opposes the first): what God “knows,” endures; what God does not “know” perishes. Note the inclusio (envelope): the poem begins with “way” (דֶּרֶךְ, derekh, v. 1) and ends with “way” (v. 6), bracketing the whole with the moral road one travels. Life is not a static attribute but a direction that God either tends or allows to run to ruin.
Placed at the head of the Psalter, Psalm 1 gives us an interpretive habit. It teaches us to hear the laments not as cynical but as the speech of one planted by teaching; to hear royal psalms as sorting kings into two ways; to hear thanksgiving as the fruit of seasons rather than the denial of droughts. It also tells us how instruction becomes character: delight, muttering, placement—all quotidian. The psalm insists that the “choice” between ways is not only made at crises but rendered day and night, by what counsel one keeps and by what words one speaks to oneself.
A brief word on the Greek: the Septuagint opens with μακάριος ἀνήρ (“happy the man”), and renders “seat of scoffers” as καθέδρα λοιμῶν—“seat of pestilences”—a pungent choice that turns mockery into social infection. It keeps the metaphors of tree and chaff intact and mirrors the Hebrew antithesis in v. 6 (“the way of the ungodly shall perish,” ἀπολλύω). The LXX confirms how early readers sensed the psalm’s public stakes: scoffing spreads; chaff disperses; a tended life endures.
One rabbinic coda reveals how intimately Israel read this poem. Torah Temimah, following Bavli (Ketubot 62b; Bava Kamma 82a), draws “who gives his fruit in its season” (אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ, v. 3) into the calendar of marital life, praising the rhythm of conjugal intimacy Erev Shabbat as a kind of seasonal fruit. It is an audacious, tender reading: Torah study does not eclipse embodied life but seasons it. The psalm’s metaphors bear such weight because they come from the ground and lead back to it: roots near channels; speech in the mouth; ways underfoot.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use
Psalm 1 stands at thresholds in Jewish prayer, marking choice and renewal.
Full psalm (Yom Kippur Maariv). In many communities (Ashkenazi and Edot HaMizrach), the entire psalm is recited on Kol Nidrei night as a devotional preface. Its opening refusal and its closing assurance frame the Day of Atonement’s work. The sequence in some Edot HaMizrach rites proceeds through Psalms 2, 3, and 24 before Barekhu, forming a liturgical porch.
Key verse (1:3). “וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ וְעָלֵהוּ לֹא־יִבּוֹל; וְכֹל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ.” “He shall be like a tree transplanted by channels of water, which gives its fruit in its season; its leaf does not wither; and all he does prospers.” In Sefardi/Edot HaMizrach usage this appears in festival contexts, including the Mussaf Amidah of the Shalosh Regalim and in expanded Rosh Hashanah night Kiddush poems, where the petition “אָנָּא ה׳ הוֹשִׁיעָה נָּא … וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי מַיִם” ties the psalm’s image to seasonal blessing and success.
Phrase (1:3) in Tefillat Geshem (Shemini Atzeret). The rain service incorporates the line: “בֵּרַכְתּו כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל פַּלְגֵי מַיִם” (“Bless him like a tree transplanted by streams of water”), immediately before invoking “מַשִּׁיב הָרוּחַ וּמוֹרִיד הַגֶּשֶׁם.” The imagery becomes a prayer for reliable water and, by extension, reliable life.
Phrases from 1:1 in Simchat Torah Hakafot. The processional supplication often includes: “וּתְזַכֵּנוּ שֶׁלֹּא נֵלֵךְ בַּעֲצַת רְשָׁעִים” (“Grant us not to walk in the counsel of the wicked”), echoing “בַּעֲצַת רְשָׁעִים” (v. 1). During a festival of joy, the community asks for moral ballast.
Prooftext in Pirkei Avot. The tractate cited in many Shabbat-minḥah customs teaches that conversation empty of Torah is a “seat of scoffers,” quoting: “וּבְמוֹשַׁב לֵצִים לֹא יָשָׁב” (1:1). The psalm thus polices the border between frivolity and sanctified speech. Across these placements, Psalm 1 is heard as both diagnosis and promise: Torah as irrigation channel; community as “assembly of the righteous.”

but the way of the wicked is doomed.

## Verse-by-Verse Commentary
Verse 1
The threefold refusal—“לֹא הָלַךְ … לֹא עָמָד … וּבְמוֹשַׁב לֵצִים לֹא יָשָׁב”—is more than moral scruple; it is choreography. The verbs sketch descent from transient exposure to fixed identity: walking (הָלַךְ), then standing (עָמַד), then sitting (יָשַׁב). The stress pattern in the supplied phonetic line places weight on each לֹא (`LŌ'`), making negation the beat that blocks the slide. Hebrew wisdom loves such staircases (sometimes called “climactic” or “staircase” parallelism when lines build by repetition and addition), but here the repetition is negative—a beautifully austere start.
The three groups map a social world: רְשָׁעִים (`rə-shā-‘IY-m`) are the “wicked”—people whose agency bends toward injustice; חַטָּאִים (`ḥat-tā-’IY-m`) are “sinners”—those whose path is marked by missing the mark; לֵצִים (`lē-TSIY-m`) are “scoffers,” whom BDB calls unteachable and haughty. The Septuagint’s “καθέδρα λοιμῶν” (“seat of pestilent [men]”) reads the last not as wit but contagion—mockery that corrupts a community. Ibn Ezra already sensed gradients here: influences that “do not stand at one standard,” luring the naive to “walk in counsel” and then fix them in place.
Two structural touches deserve notice. First, “way” (דֶּרֶךְ, derekh) appears already—“the way of sinners”—preparing the inclusio with v. 6. Second, the psalm begins with a beatitude (אַשְׁרֵי, `'ash-RĒY`), a formula used across Psalms (e.g., 2:11; 32:1) to open a horizon rather than to end an argument. Medievals (Radak, Meiri) note the plural form signals composite well-being; Malbim distinguishes “success” in this world from “happiness” of the soul—the verse aims at the latter.
Aggadic reception gives the verse social edge. Torah Temimah cites Avodah Zarah 18b condemning the Roman stadium and circus as “מוֹשַׁב לֵצִים,” applying the line to institutions that professionalize diversion. The point is not puritanism; it is attention: where one sits determines what one hears, and what one hears becomes who one is. The beat of לֹא keeps time until v. 2 supplies the alternative rhythm.
Verse 2
“כִּי אִם”—“but rather”—is the poem’s hinge. Desire turns toward instruction: “בְּתוֹרַת ה׳ חֶפְצוֹ” (“his delight is in the Torah of YHWH”). The noun חֵפֶץ (`ḤEF-tso`) is more than preference; it is relish. Torah here is not a statute-book but instruction (tôrāh) that forms a life. The next clause shifts from the objective to the possessed: “וּבְתוֹרָתוֹ יֶהְגֶּה” (“and in his Torah he meditates”). Rashi’s famous gloss—“at first God’s, then his”—honors the verse’s delicate grammar: ownership here is not sovereignty but interiority.
The verb יֶהְגֶּה (`yeh-GEH`) is tactile. BDB lists “moan, growl, utter, muse,” and the sound echoes the motion it names. The image is not of silent study but of murmuring. The adverbial phrase “יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה” (“day and night”) is a merism that signals constancy rather than literal 24/7 practice; compare Joshua 1:8, where the same verb and timeframe commission Israel’s leader. The figurative database shows the phrase’s idiomatic scope across Scripture (e.g., Genesis 8:22; Psalms 55:11): “day and night” marks a habit that frames a life.
A subtle doctrinal precision: the psalmist does not say “in commandments he meditates,” but “in Torah.” Instruction includes commands, but also narrative and promise. Meiri hears here a twofold perfection—study and practice. Malbim adds a moral interior: one does good not for gain but because it is the good; to delight in Torah is to be disinterested in reward. Torah Temimah relays an austere Talmudic riff (Kiddushin 32a) on whether Torah becomes “the sage’s,” concluding (and then qualifying) that what seems “his” remains God’s gift—an elegant counterpoint to “his Torah.”
Liturgically, the line surfaces when Jewish communities need to declare what orders time. On Yom Kippur night, as all other delights are set aside, the congregation puts this delight in its mouth. The psalm teaches a quiet art: to make the words you love your own, you must speak them until they do not merely inform you but form you.
Verse 3
“וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל”—“he will be like a tree transplanted.” The passive participle matters: like vines carefully set (cf. Ezekiel 19:10), this life is positioned. The site is “עַל־פַלְגֵי־מָיִם” (al-pal-gēy-māyim), “by channels of water,” a term from the root פ-ל-ג (“divide”), used of irrigation and, poetically, of the streams that gladden God’s city (Psalm 46:4). Ancient readers understood the practicalities: in a Mediterranean climate, prosperity comes not from romance with a stream but from reliable channels. The metaphor honors habit and husbandry.
Three results follow in a settled cadence:
- “אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ” (“which gives its fruit in its season”): “season” (עֵת) is the correction to our impatience. Fruit is not constant; it is reliable. 
- “וְעָלֵהוּ לֹא־יִבּוֹל” (“its leaf does not wither”): a picture of sustained vitality even between harvests. Ezekiel 47:12 echoes this phrase for the trees nourished by the temple river.
- “וְכֹל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ” (“and all he does prospers”): a line sometimes read as a blithe guarantee. Its own context qualifies it: “all he does” within a life irrigated by Torah; “prospers” (יַצְלִיחַ) as in “comes to good effect,” not necessarily “becomes wealthy.”
Ibn Ezra collects readings that apply “prospers” to the person (most likely) or even to the “leaf”—a midrashic hint of how readers savored the image’s parts. Rashi, with memorable warmth, says “even the waste” (פסולת) of such a person—their casual conversation—proves useful, a way of honoring how Torah-speech can season all speech.
The figure has a deep biblical life. Jeremiah 17:7–8 uses a similar tree to teach heat-resilience, not just fruitfulness; our psalm adds the agricultural specificity of channels and timing. The figurative database confirms the frequency of tree metaphors but also their flexibility: sometimes the point is rootedness (Psalm 92:13–15), sometimes resilience (Jeremiah 17), sometimes fruit (here).
Rabbinic imagination even brought the line into human cycles. Torah Temimah, citing Bavli (Ketubot 62b; Bava Kamma 82a), links “fruit in its season” to the conjugal “season” of Erev Shabbat—a reminder that “seasoned” fruitfulness includes love’s rhythms. In liturgy, the line blossoms each Shemini Atzeret in Tefillat Geshem—“בֵּרַכְתּו כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל”—where Israel begs for rain and, by implication, for lives set by waters that do not fail.
Verse 4
“לֹא־כֵן הָרְשָׁעִים”—“Not so the wicked.” The brevity is part of the argument. The righteous merited an extended, architected simile; the wicked are dispatched with a single, standard picture: “כַּמֹּץ אֲשֶׁר־תִּדְּפֶנּוּ רוּחַ” (“like chaff the wind drives away”). Chaff (מֹּץ) is the fine husk; the verb נָדַף (nadaph) means “to drive/scatter,” not drift. Elsewhere the psalmist prays his enemies “be as chaff before the wind” (Psalm 35:5); Second Isaiah uses the same threshing-floor physics for routed kings (Isaiah 41:2). The figurative database shows how often this image carries the same load: worthlessness, vulnerability, dispersal.
Radak adds a shrewdly agrarian touch: chaff not only lacks weight but annoys—blowing into eyes and houses. Wickedness is not merely empty; it is irksome and injurious in its movement. Ibn Ezra contrasts “grain” (דָּגָן) that “stands” with chaff that does not—preparing the wordplay of v. 5. The Septuagint follows suit with an equally brief “ὡς ὁ χνοῦς” (“like thistledown”), preserving the gust.
This compression does not preach instant downfall. It says: without roots, nothing resists the elements. That is why v. 3’s channels matter, and why v. 2’s murmuring matters: if you would be more than light debris in a wind, be transplanted near a source. The psalm trusts the physics of the moral world. It does not always happen at noon on a Tuesday; it happens.
Verse 5
“עַל־כֵּן”—“Therefore”—draws a line from character to consequence. “לֹא־יָקֻמוּ רְשָׁעִים בַּמִּשְׁפָּט” (“the wicked will not stand/endure in the judgment”). The verb קוּם (qum) means here to be upheld or established; it is the judicial opposite of collapse. The irony from v. 1 now comes due: the righteous refused to “stand” in the path of sinners; now sinners cannot “stand” when the tribunal convenes. The “judgment” (מִשְׁפָּט, mishpat) can be read as either the daily operation of God’s order or the final reckoning (the tradition holds both possibilities in view). Ibn Ezra and Radak gloss it as “day of death/Day of Judgment”—language that gave the verse eschatological edge.
The twin clause completes the exclusion: “וְחַטָּאִים בַּעֲדַת צַדִּיקִים” (“nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous”). The noun עֵדָה (‘ēdāh) is a gathered company, often “by appointment” (BDB), not a random crowd. Malbim suggests a distinction: the “wicked” cannot stand even in their own case; “sinners,” who might plead human frailty, still cannot join the sharpened standard of the righteous assembly.
The line resonated in halakhic and aggadic debates: Torah Temimah cites Sanhedrin 107b on those “who do not stand in judgment” and those excluded from the righteous assembly. The verse’s social imagination matters: flourishing is not a solo act but a membership. To be “transplanted” (v. 3) is to be set not only near water but among a people. That is why communities sing this line on Yom Kippur night. It solemnly names both the dignity of judgment and the consolation of belonging.
Verse 6
The final couplet is antithetic parallelism at its purest: “כִּי־יוֹדֵעַ ה׳ דֶּרֶךְ צַדִּיקִים // וְדֶרֶךְ רְשָׁעִים תֹּאבֵד.” The second colon opposes the first to clarify the claim. “Knows” (יוֹדֵעַ, yôdēa‘) here is covenantal knowing—recognition with regard. Compare Deuteronomy 34:10 (“whom YHWH knew,” of Moses), or Psalms 144:3 (“what is man that you know him?”). Radak glosses: “recognizes and attends, to do them good.” To be “known” is to be kept in view.
The “way” (דֶּרֶךְ) frames the psalm—appearing in v. 1 and here—an inclusio that says life is a path, not a pose. The wicked “way” perishes (תֹּאבֵד, toved), the same verb used of idols and hopes that vanish (e.g., Job 8:13): not merely “fails to prosper,” but runs to nothing. The Septuagint’s “γινώσκει κύριος ὁδὸν δικαίων … ὁδὸς ἀσεβῶν ἀπολεῖται” keeps the antithesis crisp: known versus lost.
The line is not a threat but a map. It teaches the reader how to read the rest of the Psalter: to trust that the path God “knows” has a future even through lament, and that the path God does not “know” has within it the seeds of its end. In Pirkei Avot’s spirit, one could say: the choice of counsel (v. 1) is already a choice of future (v. 6). The psalm insists that God’s knowledge is not the chill omniscience of a camera but the warm attention of a gardener who knows where he has set the tree. That is why the last word is perishing—not because God crushes, but because rootlessness does the work itself.
Definitions in-line: antithetic parallelism (second line opposes first to clarify meaning); inclusio (a framing repetition); “know” in Hebrew often signals covenant regard, not bare cognition; LXX (Septuagint) preserves the logic of the opposition.
Finally, the verse is a benediction the Psalter places over every prayer to come. The book will traverse rage and illness, exile and coronation. Psalm 1 does not deny the weather; it points to the channels.
