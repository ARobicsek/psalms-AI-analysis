# Commentary on Psalm 1
---
## Introduction
The editors of the Psalter begin not with a song of rescue but with a lesson in orientation. Psalm 1 is a wisdom poem that sets the compass: there are two ways to travel through the world. One leads to rootedness and fruit; the other blows away like dust. Read after this psalm, the lament and praise that follow become part of a larger schooling—how to live before God when joy is abundant or when joy runs out.
The opening word, אַשְׁרֵי, is both promise and posture. The phrase “אַשְׁרֵי הָאִישׁ”—“Happy is the man”—enters the Greek Bible as μακάριος ἀνήρ (makarios anēr), a cadence that will echo in later beatitudes. The Hebrew, though, is more than a headline. Medieval readers noted that אַשְׁרֵי is plural in form; Radak glossed: happiness is never a single windfall but a gathering of good. The psalm proceeds to specify that “gathering” not as luck but as a disciplined avoidance of bad company and a cultivated love for instruction.
The first line runs on three negations: “has not walked… has not stood… has not sat” (`**LŌ'** hā-**LAKH** … **LŌ'** ʿā-**MĀDH** … **LŌ'** yā-**SHĀV**`). Three “no’s” in a row make an anaphora (a deliberate repetition at the start of lines), and the sibilants in “מוֹשַׁב… יָשַׁב” (mōshav… yashav) bind the last two. The point is not pedantry but progression: in biblical idiom to “walk” a “way” means to adopt a manner of life (Deut 8:6; 10:12; 19:9). To “stand” can mean to hold one’s ground, especially in court (compare Deut 19:15: “A single witness shall not stand [לֹא יָקוּם] to establish a case”). To “sit” signals belonging: you’ve taken a seat, joined the circle. The nouns escalate too: “wicked” (רְשָׁעִים), the broad biblical term for those set against God’s order; “sinners” (חַטָּאִים), those who miss the mark; and “scoffers” (לֵצִים), the incorrigible mockers of Proverbs who treat correction as a joke. The Septuagint renders לֵצִים as λοιμοί (“pestilent ones”), shifting the emphasis from mockery to social contagion—moral derision as a public health hazard. Either way, the psalm begins with the sociology of character: the people you walk with train your gait.
Then comes the pivot: “but rather” (`**KIY** 'im-`)—a reversal in grammar and path. The blessed person delights in “the Torah of YHWH” and “meditates” on it “day and night.” The key verb, יֶהְגֶּה (`yeh-**GEH**`), is tactile: to murmur, to growl, to keep words in the mouth until they flavor the mind. When Joshua is told “וְהָגִיתָ בּוֹ יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה” (“meditate on it day and night,” Josh 1:8), a habit is prescribed: recitation becoming rumination. Here, the poem moves from “תּוֹרַת ה׳” (“the teaching of YHWH”) to “וּבְתוֹרָתוֹ” (“in his teaching”); the sages loved that turn. Rashi cites the rabbinic gloss (Avodah Zarah 19a): at first it is God’s Torah; through toil it becomes yours. The merism “day and night” (naming two poles to mean the whole) signals not an hour count but a through-line: this is what your mind returns to.
The heart of the psalm is horticulture. “He is like a tree planted (`shā-**THŪL**`) by channels of water (`pal-ghēy-**MĀ**-yim`).” The participle שָׁתוּל means transplanted—set in a chosen place (Jer 17:8; Ezek 19:10; Ps 92:14). The site is irrigated: פַלְגֵי מַיִם are divided runnels, not a single river. This is cultivation as much as nature. The three clauses that follow are compact and sensuous: “gives its fruit in season,” “its leaf does not wither,” “whatever he does prospers.” BDB notes יִבּוֹל (“withers,” from נָבֵל) is used for leaves and for moral collapse; here its negation is botanical and ethical stamina. The last line—“כֹּל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ”—feels absolute. Readers as early as the Talmud pressed it into daily life with audacity (Ketubbot 62b: “This is one who fulfills marital ‘season’ on the eve of Sabbath”), while others noticed that the Psalter itself will complicate the claim. Psalm 73 looks squarely at prosperous wickedness. The wisdom of Psalm 1 is not a vending machine. It describes the long arc of a life rooted by a reliable water source; the time-scale is “in season.”
The wicked receive only a sketch: “Not so… but like chaff the wind drives away” (כַּמֹּץ אֲשֶׁר־תִּדְּפֶנּוּ רוּחַ). Chaff is threshing-floor waste—light, good for nothing, at the mercy of a breeze (Ps 35:5; 83:14; Isa 17:13). The asymmetry is deliberate; there is less to say about insubstantiality. The legal turn in vv. 5–6 completes the moral geography. “Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment” (עַל־כֵן לֹא־יָקֻמוּ רְשָׁעִים בַּמִּשְׁפָּט). Again the verb “stand” carries forensic weight: Deuteronomy uses יָקוּם for the validation of testimony (19:15). To “stand in judgment” is to be vindicated; they will not. Nor will “sinners stand in the assembly of the righteous” (בַּעֲדַת צַדִּיקִים). עֵדָה is the technical word for an appointed congregation; here it marks belonging—who counts as part of the enduring people.
The final couplet states, with lapidary clarity, the antithesis the poem has been building: “For YHWH knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked perishes.” To “know” (יָדַע) in Hebrew often exceeds cognition: “I have known you by name,” God tells Moses (Exod 33:12); “I knew you in the wilderness,” the prophet says for God (Hos 13:5). It is elective regard, watchful care. The line is as compact a theology as the Bible offers: the path aligned with God’s instruction is kept in God’s knowledge; the other path, by its own design, unravels.
Two features sharpen this architecture. First, the psalm is framed by “way” (דֶּרֶךְ) in v. 1 and v. 6—an inclusio, a matching phrase at start and finish that marks a unit and its theme. Second, early Jewish tradition paired Psalm 1 with Psalm 2 (see b. Berakhot 9b): together, they stretch from “Torah” in the quiet mind to “nations” in public tumult. Read in tandem, they teach that meditation and politics are not separate compartments but adjoining rooms.
Comparative literature does help. Egyptian and Mesopotamian instruction texts do speak of two paths and of a righteous life. What is distinctive here is not the binary but the source: delight is anchored to Torah—the particular instruction of Israel’s God—not to royal etiquette or pragmatic shrewdness. And the figure is not a sage in a court but an ordinary person placed like a tree by hand.
Technical notes for the curious:
- “Colon” refers to a single line (or half-line) of verse; biblical poetry builds meaning by the relation between cola.
- “Antithetic parallelism” is when the second colon sets an opposite against the first (“A is so, but B”); Psalm 1:6 is a classic instance.
- “Inclusio” is the bracketing of a unit with a repeated word or phrase (“way” in vv. 1 and 6).
- “MT” denotes the Masoretic Text, the standard medieval Hebrew tradition; “LXX” is the Septuagint, the ancient Greek translation; “BDB” is the Brown–Driver–Briggs Hebrew lexicon.
The effect of Psalm 1 is to reorient the reader: before we learn to cry out or to rejoice, we are taught where to put our roots. The Psalter opens not with a mood but with a planting.
## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use
Psalm 1 is not part of the fixed daily or Shabbat cycle as a whole, but its language threads through Jewish prayer. The beatitude formula אַשְׁרֵי stands behind the prayer popularly called “Ashrei” (recited daily at Shacharit and Mincha), whose refrain is Psalm 145 but is framed by beatitude verses (Ps 84:5; 144:15). The prominence of אַשְׁרֵי as a liturgical word of blessed orientation gives Psalm 1’s opening line wide resonance.
Verse 2’s “יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה” (“day and night”) shapes the morning blessings over Torah (Birkhot HaTorah). After those blessings, many rites include a short anthology of texts on learning Torah that features Joshua 1:8 (“וְהָגִיתָ בּוֹ יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה”), whose language mirrors Psalm 1:2’s “וּבְתוֹרָתוֹ יֶהְגֶּה יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה.” The pairing makes explicit what Psalm 1 implies: a life ordered by regular, audible study.
The tree image of v. 3 has colored piyyut (liturgical poetry) and communal blessings that pray for “planting” and prosperity, especially in communities that emphasize Torah learning as the heart of communal flourishing. In short, Jewish liturgy receives Psalm 1 as a doorway: blessedness is a practiced orientation—resisting corrosive company, taking delight in the words that make a people—and prayer assumes that orientation as its daily ground.

or taken the path of sinners,
or joined the company of the insolent;
2. כִּ֤י אִ֥ם־בְּתוֹרַ֥ת ה׳ חֶ֫פְצ֥וֹ וּֽבְתוֹרָת֥וֹ יֶהְגֶּ֗ה יוֹמָ֥ם וָלָֽיְלָה׃‎		rather, the teaching of the LORD is his delight,
and he studies that teaching day and night.
3. וְֽהָיָ֗ה כְּעֵץ֮ שָׁת֢וּל עַֽל־פַּלְגֵ֫י־מָ֥יִם אֲשֶׁ֤ר פִּרְי֨וֹ ׀ יִתֵּ֬ן בְּעִתּ֗וֹ וְעָלֵ֥הוּ לֹֽא־יִבּ֑וֹל וְכֹ֖ל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂ֣ה יַצְלִֽיחַ׃‎		He is like a tree planted beside streams of water,

whose foliage never fades,
and whatever it produces thrives.-b

but the way of the wicked is doomed.

## Verse-by-Verse Commentary
**Verse 1**
אַ֥שְֽׁרֵי־הָאִ֗ישׁ אֲשֶׁ֤ר ׀ לֹ֥א הָלַךְ֮ בַּעֲצַ֢ת רְשָׁ֫עִ֥ים וּבְדֶ֣רֶךְ חַ֭טָּאִים לֹ֥א עָמָ֑ד וּבְמוֹשַׁ֥ב לֵ֝צִ֗ים לֹ֣א יָשָֽׁב׃
The psalm opens with אַשְׁרֵי הָאִישׁ, “Happy is the man.” Radak notes that אַשְׁרֵי is plural in form, hinting that happiness is composite, a confluence of goods. In Greek the line becomes μακάριος ἀνήρ, the beatitude cadence that later literature will make famous.
The three clauses build a staircase of refusal—“has not walked… has not stood… has not sat” (`**LŌ'** hā-**LAKH** … **LŌ'** ʿā-**MĀDH** … **LŌ'** yā-**SHĀV**`). The repeated `**LŌ'**` (no/not) creates anaphora (deliberate initial repetition), and the sibilant cluster in “מוֹשַׁב … יָשַׁב” (mōshav … yashav) tightens the cadence. The metaphor of “walking” as conduct is idiomatic: “לָלֶכֶת בִּדְרָכָיו” (“to walk in His ways”) defines covenant life (Deut 8:6; 10:12; 19:9). “Standing” carries forensic force: “לֹא יָקוּם עֵד אֶחָד” (“A single witness shall not stand,” Deut 19:15) means “shall not be legally valid.” “Sitting” suggests settled belonging—taking one’s seat among a group.
The nouns also escalate: רְשָׁעִים (“wicked”), the broad antithesis of righteousness; חַטָּאִים (“sinners”), those who miss the target; and לֵצִים (“scoffers”), the incurable mockers of Proverbs (BDB: proud, allergic to correction; see Prov 9:7–8; 21:24). The Septuagint renders לֵצִים as λοιμοί, “pestilent [people],” highlighting their social toxicity rather than their sarcasm. The pairing “עֲצַת רְשָׁעִים” (“counsel of the wicked”) recurs elsewhere only in Job 21:16, where the speaker distances himself from that counsel—an intertext that underlines the psalm’s call to refusal. “מוֹשַׁב לֵצִים” (“seat of scoffers”) is unique to this verse; the very uniqueness of the phrase makes it memorable as a social warning label.
Poetically, each colon (single line of verse) pushes the image forward: from passing association (“walk”) to lingering presence (“stand”) to settled identity (“sit”). The “way” (דֶּרֶךְ), introduced here, will return in v. 6 as an inclusio (a repeat at beginning and end that frames the unit). The verse sketches a sociology of virtue by negation: do not apprentice yourself to cynicism; do not ratify wicked advice by your presence; do not become what you sit among.
Finally, the stress pattern in the provided phonetic line makes the triple `**LŌ'**` audible as a rhythmic brake, while the shared “-SHAV” in “מוֹשָׁב … יָשָׁב” reinforces the idea of settling. Form enacts meaning: the poem slows the reader at each threshold—walk … stand … sit—so that the “no” can do its work.
**Verse 2**
כִּ֤י אִ֥ם־בְּתוֹרַ֥ת ה׳ חֶ֫פְצ֥וֹ וּֽבְתוֹרָת֥וֹ יֶהְגֶּ֗ה יוֹמָ֥ם וָלָֽיְלָה׃
“כִּי אִם” marks the reversal—“but rather.” The movement from negative to positive is the hinge of the psalm’s ethic. The blessed person delights: “כִּי אִם־בְּתוֹרַת ה׳ חֶפְצוֹ” (“but his pleasure is in the teaching of YHWH”). חֵפֶץ denotes desire, not duty; BDB registers its use for divine purpose as well (Isa 53:10). Piety here is eros for wisdom.
The verb “יֶהְגֶּה” (`yeh-**GEH**`) is bodily: to murmur, growl, mutter. It is the on-the-lips study style of antiquity, the sound of words being kept in circulation until their sense settles in. Its semantic range includes “to plot” (negatively in Ps 2:1: “לָמָּה רָגְשׁוּ גוֹיִם… וִיהְגּוּ רִיק”—“why do the nations rage… and peoples devise vain things”), which heightens the contrast: the righteous “plot” Torah; nations “plot” vanity. The merism “יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה” (“day and night”) signals comprehensiveness, as when Joshua is commanded, “וְהָגִיתָ בּוֹ יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה” (Josh 1:8). This is not a stopwatch requirement but a center of gravity: what does the mind return to when it has a moment?
Rashi, citing Avodah Zarah 19a, notices the pivot from “תּוֹרַת ה׳” to “וּבְתוֹרָתוֹ”: at first it is God’s Torah; after labor it becomes yours. That possessive pronoun marks internalization. The psalm thus defines devotion not as generic spirituality but as the joyful, sustained attention to revealed instruction—a specifically Israelite move when set against ANE wisdom’s courtly pragmatism.
Sound and syntax matter. The flowing vowels in `**KIY** 'im-bə-thō-**RATH** … khef-**TSŌ**` contrast with the staccato negatives of v. 1. The music shifts from “no-no-no” to a long vowel pour, matching the content: renunciation opens into savoring. The verse also completes a parallel with v. 1: avoiding corrosive counsel (“עֲצַת רְשָׁעִים”) is matched by embracing YHWH’s counsel; “walking/standing/sitting” is replaced by “meditating.”
Liturgically, the phrase “יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה” reverberates in the Birkhot HaTorah (daily blessings over Torah), where Joshua 1:8 is recited; the shared language underscores the tradition’s reading of Psalm 1 as a charter for life ordered by study.
Define two terms: “merism” is naming two extremes (“day and night”) to suggest the whole. “Colon” is a single poetic line; here, the colon pair works as “A is so, and what’s more, B.”
**Verse 3**
וְֽהָיָ֗ה כְּעֵץ֮ שָׁת֢וּל עַֽל־פַּלְגֵ֫י־מָ֥יִם אֲשֶׁ֤ר פִּרְי֨וֹ ׀ יִתֵּ֬ן בְּעִתּ֗וֹ וְעָלֵ֥הוּ לֹֽא־יִבּ֑וֹל וְכֹ֖ל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂ֣ה יַצְלִֽיחַ׃
The central simile is lush and precise: “וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם.” שָׁתוּל (shātul) is not simply “planted” but “transplanted”—set intentionally (BDB; cf. Jer 17:8; Ezek 19:10; Ps 92:14). The site, “פַּלְגֵי מַיִם,” denotes channels, divided streams—irrigation runnels rather than a lone river. This is husbandry: stable water supply engineered for flourishing.
The triad that follows is a picture of steady abundance: “אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ” (“that yields its fruit in its season”), “וְעָלֵהוּ לֹא יִבּוֹל” (“its leaf does not wither”), “וְכֹל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ” (“and in all he does he prospers”). The verb יִבּוֹל (from נָבֵל) elsewhere describes withering leaves (Isa 34:4) and moral decline (Ps 37:2). Negated here, it renders a moral-botanical stability. יַצְלִיחַ (Hifil of צלח) is the causative of “advance/succeed,” often with God as the agent (“YHWH made all he did prosper,” Gen 39:3–4). The psalm leaves the agent implicit, but within the canon the verb leans theologically: prosperity comes by alignment with divine instruction.
The image has a biblical cluster: Jeremiah 17:8 uses the same transplanting near water; Ezekiel 47:12 pictures trees by a life-giving stream whose “leaf does not wither.” Our psalm’s channels connect a righteous person to a reliable source in a climate where rain is not a given. That concreteness matters: the metaphor is not reward-by-dispensation but rootedness-by-placement.
The absolute tone of “כֹּל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ” has long provoked commentary. The Psalter will qualify the timetable (see Ps 73), and life does the same. But the metaphor quietly answers the worry: fruit “in season.” Stability is seasonal, not instantaneous; the blessing of Torah is sufficiency at the right time, not an immunity to drought. Even the leaf—what seems decorative—is preserved; rabbinic readers took this to mean that even the offhand conversation of the learned has purpose (Rashi ad loc., Avodah Zarah 19b).
Phonetically, the provided stresses—`wə-hā-**YĀH** kə-**ʿĒTS** shā-**THŪL** ʿal-pal-ghēy-**MĀ**-yim`—open into long vowels (YĀH… ʿĒTS… MĀ-) that slow the line into a broad, verdant cadence. The sound fits the picture: a planted, well-watered life.
Figurative pattern: the “tree by water” is a wisdom staple (Jer 17:8), but the plural “channels” marks cultivated abundance. This is Israel’s desert agriculture transposed into moral topography.
**Verse 4**
לֹא־כֵ֥ן הָרְשָׁעִ֑ים כִּ֥י אִם־כַּ֝מֹּ֗ץ אֲֽשֶׁר־תִּדְּפֶ֥נּוּ רֽוּחַ׃
“לֹא כֵן הָרְשָׁעִים” (“Not so the wicked!”) is a sudden snap. The image is chaff: “כַּמֹּץ אֲשֶׁר־תִּדְּפֶנּוּ רוּחַ” (“like chaff which the wind drives away”). מֹץ is the fine husk left after threshing, worthless and light. The verb נָדַף (“drive away”) appears with wind as subject elsewhere (Ps 68:3; Isa 41:2); the wicked are imagined as unanchored residue. The figurative language database locates the chaff image some ten times; Psalm 35:5 (“Let them be like chaff before the wind”) and Psalm 83:14 (“like stubble before the wind”) are close parallels; Isaiah 17:13 adds the threshing-floor context. In every case, the pattern is fragility and ephemerality under divine judgment.
What is distinctive here is the asymmetry of development. The righteous are unfolded across three clauses of growth and season; the wicked receive a single breath of dispersion. The psalm refuses to grant evil an elaborate poetics. Radak underlines chaff’s nuisance: it blows into eyes and gardens, doing harm as it goes, but it has no substance and no future.
Sound-wise, the line’s stressed syllables `lō'-**KHĒN** … **MŌTS** …` land on harsh gutturals and hard consonants, then the air of “רוּחַ” empties the line. The phonetic effect is vanishing.
Theologically, this is not retribution fantasy; it is ontology. Chaff is not punished; it is what it is—disconnected from grain, easily moved, quickly gone. The psalm insists that moral choices have weight or weightlessness; one outcome leaves residue, the other does not.
**Verse 5**
עַל־כֵּ֤ן ׀ לֹא־יָקֻ֣מוּ רְ֭שָׁעִים בַּמִּשְׁפָּ֑ט וְ֝חַטָּאִ֗ים בַּעֲדַ֥ת צַדִּיקִֽים׃
“עַל־כֵּן” (“Therefore”) draws the legal conclusion. “לֹא יָקֻמוּ רְשָׁעִים בַּמִּשְׁפָּט” (“The wicked will not stand in the judgment”). The verb יָקוּם (“stand/arise”) is a legal term for validity (Deut 19:15: “עַל־פִּי שְׁנֵי עֵדִים… יָקוּם דָּבָר,” “by two witnesses a matter shall stand”). To “stand” at judgment is to be upheld; they will not. Nor will “חַטָּאִים” (“sinners”) be in “בַּעֲדַת צַדִּיקִים” (“the assembly of the righteous”). עֵדָה is the appointed congregation (a technical term in Pentateuchal usage). Here the image shifts from court to community: exclusion is not only a verdict but a loss of belonging.
Medieval readers debated timing. Radak hears “the day of death”: no rising again into the noble assembly; others read an eschatological horizon. Malbim suggests a two-tiered hearing: a person might “stand” when judged by his own weak excuses but cannot stand when measured among those who mastered the same appetites and chose otherwise. Either way, the verse establishes a forensic horizon that makes sense of the psalm’s moral urgency.
Phonetically, the stresses `ʿal-**KĒN** lō'-yā-**QU**-mū … bam-mish-**PĀT**` thump like a gavel—“there-fore … stand … judg-ment”—a mimetic cadence of finality.
Comparative idiom: “stand” as “endure or prevail” is common (Ps 24:3: “מִי־יַעֲמֹד בִּמְקוֹם קָדְשׁוֹ,” “who may stand in His holy place?”). “Assembly of the righteous” answers the “seat of scoffers” in v. 1; the psalm’s social logic runs from benches to congregations.
**Verse 6**
כִּֽי־יוֹדֵ֣עַ ה׳ דֶּ֣רֶךְ צַדִּיקִ֑ים וְדֶ֖רֶךְ רְשָׁעִ֣ים תֹּאבֵֽד׃ {פ}
The final couplet is antithetic parallelism at its most distilled: “כִּי־יוֹדֵעַ ה׳ דֶּרֶךְ צַדִּיקִים // וְדֶרֶךְ רְשָׁעִים תֹּאבֵד.” To “know” (יָדַע) in biblical idiom frequently signals covenantal care, selection, and sustained regard (Exod 33:12: “יְדַעְתִּיךָ בְשֵׁם,” “I have known you by name”; Hos 13:5: “אָנֹכִי יְדַעְתִּיךָ בַּמִּדְבָּר,” “I knew you in the wilderness”). Rashi paraphrases: the righteous way remains before Him; the wicked path He removes from before Him. The verb תֹּאבֵד (“perishes”) has punch (BDB: used for annihilation of idols, peoples, hopes). Here the way itself comes to nothing, not merely the walker.
The inclusio on “דֶּרֶךְ” (v. 1, v. 6) frames the poem: life is a route; God’s care is pictured as a road preserved; the opposite road is a cul-de-sac. Malbim presses the metaphysics: what God “knows” abides; what God does not “know” cannot endure.
Two clarifications for readers:
- “Antithetic parallelism” is when a second line opposes the first to sharpen meaning (“A is so; B is its opposite”). The psalm’s last line is the textbook case.
- “Inclusio” is a framing device: the same key word opens and closes the unit to mark its unity and focus.
The Greek version (LXX) reads, “ὅτι γιγνώσκει κύριος ὁδὸν δικαίων // καὶ ὁδὸς ἀσεβῶν ἀπολεῖται”—very close to the Hebrew. The makarios of v. 1 and the gnōskei (“knows”) of v. 6 set the tone for how the Greek-speaking synagogue and later readers heard the psalm: as a beatitude anchored in a God who keeps a people’s way.
Across six verses, Psalm 1 moves from the company we keep, through the habits we love, to the kind of future such loves make possible. It is not a lecture, finally, but a planting: the editors set a tree with a steady water source at the very gate of prayer and invited us to step under its shade.
Definitions used:
- “LXX” (Septuagint): the ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible; sometimes it preserves interpretive choices that illuminate how early readers understood the Hebrew.
- “MT” (Masoretic Text): the standard medieval Hebrew text tradition.
- “BDB” (Brown–Driver–Briggs): a classic Hebrew lexicon, useful for word ranges and examples.
- “Colon”: a single line or half-line of Hebrew verse.
- “Inclusio”: bracketing a unit with the same term or phrase at beginning and end.
- “Antithetic parallelism”: a poetic device where the second line opposes the first to clarify meaning.
