## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (10)

1. What is the precise semantic range of הָלַךְ/עָמָד/יָשָׁב (walk/stand/sit) in v. 1—are these technical terms for levels of commitment, spatial metaphors for social proximity, or simply synonymous variations? How does this triadic progression function in other wisdom texts?
2. What does יֶהְגֶּה (meditate/murmur/mutter) mean in v. 2? Does it suggest vocalized, embodied practice (murmuring, recitation) or internal contemplation? How is this term used elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible (Josh 1:8; Ps 2:1; Isa 31:4)?
3. Is the passive participle שָׁתוּל (planted) in v. 3 significant theologically? Does it suggest the righteous person is passively transformed by God rather than self-made? Who is the implied agent of planting?
4. What is the symbolic and agricultural background of chaff (מֹץ) imagery in v. 4? How does this relate to threshing floor scenes as judgment contexts elsewhere in Scripture (Ruth 3; 2 Sam 24; prophetic literature)?
5. What does יָקֻמוּ (stand/arise) mean in v. 5—is this judicial language (standing in court), resurrection/eschatological imagery, or both? What is 'the judgment' (בַּמִּשְׁפָּט) referenced here?
6. What is the 'assembly of the righteous' (עֲדַת צַדִּיקִים) in v. 5? Is this a liturgical/cultic gathering, eschatological community, or metaphor for the blessed state? How does עֵדָה function in Psalms?
7. What does יוֹדֵעַ (knows) connote in v. 6? Is this epistemological (God is aware), relational/covenantal (God acknowledges in relationship, cf. Amos 3:2; Gen 18:19), or ontological (God's knowledge constitutes reality)? What is the 'knowing' God does?
8. How do the three wicked categories in v. 1—רְשָׁעִים (wicked), חַטָּאִים (sinners), לֵצִים (scoffers/insolent)—relate to each other? Are they synonymous, progressive, or distinct types? What is the specific nuance of לֵצִים?
9. What is the function of כִּי in vv. 2 and 6? Is it causal (because), emphatic (indeed/surely), adversative (but), or asseverative? How does this affect the logical flow?
10. How does Psalm 1 function redactionally as introduction to the Psalter? What connections exist with Psalm 2 (some manuscripts combine them; both mention meditation/muttering-הָגָה; both end with blessing)? How does it reframe the cultic psalms as Torah meditation?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (6)

1. What is the precise semantic relationship between the three categories of 'wicked' (רְשָׁעִים, חַטָּאִים, לֵצִים) in verse 1? Do they represent distinct types of sinners or a progressive intensification of wickedness?
2. How should the meditation verb 'יֶהְגֶּה' in verse 2 be understood—is it silent, internal contemplation or audible, low murmuring? What does this imply about the nature of Torah study in the post-exilic period?
3. Is the passive participle 'planted' (שָׁתוּל) in verse 3 theologically significant? Does it undermine a 'works-based' reading of righteousness by suggesting divine agency, and if so, who is the implied planter?
4. What is the precise function of divine 'knowing' (יוֹדֵעַ) in verse 6? Is it cognitive awareness, covenantal relationship, or an ontological act where God's knowledge constitutes reality?
5. How does the stark structural asymmetry between the description of the righteous (3 verses, lush imagery) and the wicked (3 verses, sparse imagery) function rhetorically? Is it merely a poetic device, or does it perform the psalm's central theological claim about substance vs. emptiness?
6. What is the nature of 'the judgment' (הַמִּשְׁפָּט) and the 'assembly of the righteous' (עֲדַת צַדִּיקִים) in verse 5? Are these references to present cultic/legal realities or future eschatological hope?
