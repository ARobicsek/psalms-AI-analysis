## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (10)

1. What is the specific meaning and cultural significance of לצים (scoffers/mockers) in wisdom literature contexts?
2. How does the forensic imagery in v. 5 (משפט and עדת צדיקים) relate to temple or legal procedures in ancient Israel?
3. What are the Ancient Near Eastern parallels to the 'two ways' theme, particularly in wisdom traditions?
4. How does the threefold progression in v. 1 (עצת/דרך/מושב) reflect Hebrew psychological understanding of moral development?
5. What is the theological significance of the tree being 'planted' (שתול) versus naturally growing, and how does this relate to divine agency?
6. How does the emphasis on Torah study 'day and night' (יומם ולילה) connect to specific post-exilic educational or devotional practices?
7. What is the relationship between יצליח (prosper/succeed) in v. 3 and covenant blessing formulas elsewhere in scripture?
8. How does the chaff imagery in v. 4 relate to harvest and judgment metaphors throughout biblical literature?
9. What does ידע (know) in v. 6 suggest about the nature of divine knowledge—cognitive awareness or covenantal relationship?
10. How does this psalm's placement as Psalm 1 function editorially to interpret the entire Psalter?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (6)

1. Why does the psalm give three verses to describing the righteous but only one and a half to the wicked - what does this asymmetry accomplish rhetorically?
2. What is the significance of the tree being 'transplanted' (שָׁתוּל) rather than naturally grown - does this imply divine initiative beyond human choice?
3. How should we understand the absolute claim that 'whatever he does prospers' (כֹל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ) in light of other wisdom literature's more nuanced view of suffering?
4. Why does the LXX translate לֵצִים (scoffers) as λοιμός (plague/pestilence) - what does this reveal about ancient interpretation of moral corruption?
5. What is the relationship between the forensic imagery in v.5 (judgment, assembly of righteous) and the agricultural metaphors - are these sequential or simultaneous realities?
6. Why does YHWH actively 'know' the way of the righteous but the way of the wicked simply 'perishes' without explicit divine action - what theology of judgment does this suggest?
