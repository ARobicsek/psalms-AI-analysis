## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (8)

1. What specific practices does 'meditating on Torah day and night' (הגה) refer to in post-exilic Jewish communities?
2. How does the legal/judicial imagery in vv. 5-6 (משפט, עדת צדיקים) relate to eschatological judgment traditions?
3. What are the Ancient Near Eastern parallels to the 'two ways' theology presented here?
4. How does the tree imagery connect to broader biblical and ANE traditions of cosmic trees and divine blessing?
5. What is the significance of the threefold progression in v. 1 (counsel→path→seat) in Hebrew wisdom literature?
6. How does this psalm's retribution theology set up tensions that later psalms will explore (particularly in lament traditions)?
7. What is the relationship between individual piety and community identity in the 'assembly of the righteous' concept?
8. How does the divine 'knowing' in v. 6 relate to covenant election and divine care traditions?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (7)

1. Why does the psalm use שָׁתוּל (transplanted) rather than נָטַע (planted) - does this suggest conversion rather than natural righteousness?
2. What is the significance of יֶהְגֶּה (murmur/mutter) - does Torah study involve specific vocal practices?
3. Why is the description of the wicked so abbreviated compared to the elaborate righteous imagery?
4. How does the judicial language in v.5 (משפט, עדת) relate to the agricultural metaphors of vv.3-4?
5. Why does YHWH actively 'know' the righteous way but the wicked way simply 'perishes' without divine action?
6. What distinguishes the three categories of wicked people in v.1 (רשעים, חטאים, לצים)?
7. How does the merismus 'day and night' in v.2 relate to the seasonal imagery 'in its season' in v.3?
