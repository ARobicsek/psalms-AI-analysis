## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (8)

1. What is the significance of the three-fold description of evildoers (רְשָׁעִים, חַטָּאִים, לֵצִים) and how do these terms create a taxonomy of wickedness?
2. How does the progression of verbs in v.1 (walked, stood, sat) relate to Ancient Near Eastern wisdom traditions about moral decline?
3. What are the specific connotations of the tree imagery in v.3, particularly the phrase 'planted beside streams of water' in ancient Mediterranean agricultural contexts?
4. How does the legal/judicial language in v.5 ('survive judgment', 'assembly of the righteous') relate to Divine Warrior and covenant lawsuit traditions?
5. What does the verb יוֹדֵעַ ('knows/cherishes') in v.6 signify in covenant contexts, and how does it contrast with the fate of the wicked way?
6. How does Psalm 1's 'two ways' theology function as an interpretive key for the lament and praise psalms that follow?
7. What is the relationship between תוֹרָה in this psalm and the broader biblical concept of divine instruction versus legal code?
8. How do the perfect and imperfect verb forms throughout the psalm create temporal perspectives on moral choice and divine response?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (7)

1. Why does the psalm present three distinct categories of evildoers (רְשָׁעִים, חַטָּאִים, לֵצִים) - do they represent different stages or types of wickedness?
2. What is the specific significance of the verb הָגָה (meditate/mutter) - does it suggest vocal recitation, mental pondering, or something else?
3. Why is the tree described as 'planted' (שָׁתוּל) rather than naturally growing - what does intentional placement suggest?
4. How does the progressive verb sequence (walked→stood→sat) relate to ancient Near Eastern concepts of moral decline?
5. What does the divine 'knowing' (יוֹדֵעַ) of the righteous way imply - mere awareness, approval, or covenantal care?
6. Why is the chaff metaphor so compressed compared to the elaborate tree imagery - is brevity itself the point?
7. How does the judicial language in v.5 relate to the nature metaphors - is this present reality or eschatological future?
