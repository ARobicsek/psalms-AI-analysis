## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (10)

1. What is the precise semantic range of הָלַךְ/עָמָד/יָשָׁב (walk/stand/sit) in v. 1—are these technical terms for levels of commitment, spatial metaphors for social proximity, or simply synonymous variations? How does this triadic progression function in other wisdom texts?
2. What does יֶהְגֶּה (meditate/murmur/mutter) mean in v. 2? Does it suggest vocalized, embodied practice (murmuring, recitation) or internal contemplation? How is this term used elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible (Josh 1:8; Ps 2:1; Isa 31:4)?
3. Is the passive participle שָׁתוּל (planted) in v. 3 significant theologically? Does it suggest the righteous person is passively transformed by God rather than self-made? Who is the implied agent of planting?
4. What is the symbolic and agricultural background of chaff (מֹץ) imagery in v. 4? How does this relate to threshing floor scenes as judgment contexts elsewhere in Scripture (Ruth 3; 2 Sam 24; prophetic literature)?
5. What does יָקֻמוּ (stand/arise) mean in v. 5—is this judicial language (standing in court), resurrection/eschatological imagery, or both? What is 'the judgment' (בַּמִּשְׁפָּט) referenced here?
6. What is the 'assembly of the righteous' (עֲדַת צַדִּיקִים) in v. 5? Is this a liturgical/cultic gathering, eschatological community, or metaphor for the blessed state? How does עֵדָה function in Psalms?
7. What does יוֹדֵעַ (knows) connote in v. 6? Is this epistemological (God is aware), relational/covenantal (God acknowledges in relationship, cf. Amos 3:2; Gen 18:19), or ontological (God's knowledge constitutes reality)? What is the 'knowing' God does?
8. How do the three wicked categories in v. 1—רְשָׁעִים (wicked), חַטָּאִים (sinners), לֵצִים (scoffers/insolent)—relate to each other? Are they synonymous, progressive, or distinct types? What is the specific nuance of לֵצִים?
9. What is the function of כִּי in vv. 2 and 6? Is it causal (because), emphatic (indeed/surely), adversative (but), or asseverative? How does this affect the logical flow?
10. How does Psalm 1 function redactionally as introduction to the Psalter? What connections exist with Psalm 2 (some manuscripts combine them; both mention meditation/muttering-הָגָה; both end with blessing)? How does it reframe the cultic psalms as Torah meditation?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (12)

1. What is the precise semantic difference between הָלַךְ (walked), עָמָד (stood), and יָשָׁב (sat) in v.1—are these stages of progressive entanglement, spatial metaphors, or synonymous variations for poetic effect?
2. Does יֶהְגֶּה (meditate/murmur) in v.2 indicate vocalized, embodied practice (murmuring, recitation aloud) or internal contemplation, and how does this affect understanding of Torah engagement?
3. Why is the tree שָׁתוּל (planted, passive) in v.3 rather than using an active verb—does this suggest divine agency positioning the righteous rather than self-made righteousness?
4. What is the function and background of חַף (chaff) imagery in v.4—how does this connect to threshing floor scenes as judgment contexts elsewhere in Scripture, and what does it suggest about wicked ontology?
5. What does יָקֻמוּ (stand/arise) mean in v.5—is this purely judicial language (standing in court), eschatological/resurrection imagery, or deliberately ambiguous?
6. What is the 'assembly of the righteous' (עֲדַת צַדִּיקִים) in v.5—a liturgical/cultic gathering, eschatological community, social reality, or metaphor for the blessed state?
7. What does יוֹדֵעַ (knows) connote in v.6—epistemological awareness, relational/covenantal acknowledgment (cf. Amos 3:2), or ontologically constitutive knowing (God's knowledge creates/sustains reality)?
8. How do the three wicked categories in v.1—רְשָׁעִים (wicked), חַטָּאִים (sinners), לֵצִים (scoffers)—relate: are they synonymous, progressive stages of wickedness, or distinct types, and what specifically does לֵצִים add?
9. Why does the wicked way 'perish' (תֹּאבֵד) in v.6 with no explicit agent—is this divine action, inherent consequence of lacking divine recognition, or self-destruction?
10. How does Psalm 1 function redactionally as introduction to the Psalter, especially in relation to Psalm 2 (same הָגָה verb used contrastively, both mention blessing, possible original unity)?
11. What is the significance of the structural asymmetry—elaborate righteous description vs. sparse wicked description—is this deliberate rhetorical choice to perform ontological difference?
12. Why 'streams' (plural, פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם) in v.3 rather than a single water source—does this suggest continuous, abundant, deliberate irrigation system as metaphor for Torah supply?
