## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (8)

1. What is the significance of the specific verb sequence in v. 1 (halak/amad/yashab) and how does it relate to Ancient Near Eastern idioms of moral progression?
2. How does the concept of 'hagah' (meditation/murmuring) in v. 2 relate to ancient practices of Torah study and oral tradition?
3. What is the background of the tree-by-water imagery in v. 3, particularly in relation to Ancient Near Eastern temple and cosmic symbolism?
4. How does the legal terminology in v. 5 ('mishpat', 'adat tzaddikim') reflect specific judicial or cultic contexts?
5. What does 'yada' (knows/cherishes) in v. 6 imply about the nature of divine providence and covenant relationship?
6. How does the chaff metaphor in v. 4 function within the broader biblical and ANE harvest imagery tradition?
7. What is the relationship between this psalm's 'two ways' theology and similar patterns in Deuteronomy and wisdom literature?
8. How does the psalm's position as introduction to the Psalter influence its interpretation and theological function?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (7)

1. Why does the psalm use the specific verb progression halak/amad/yashab in v1 - does this reflect a known idiom or cultural pattern?
2. What is the precise meaning of 'hagah' in v2 - is this vocal recitation, mental meditation, or memorization technique?
3. Why is the tree 'planted' (shatul) rather than naturally growing - what does this suggest about divine agency?
4. What accounts for the asymmetrical treatment of righteous vs wicked - is this theological bias or rhetorical strategy?
5. How does the legal imagery in v5 ('stand in judgment', 'assembly') relate to specific judicial or cultic practices?
6. What does divine 'knowing' (yada) in v6 imply beyond cognitive awareness - covenant care, election, or providence?
7. Why does the wicked's way 'perish' (toved) while the righteous person 'prospers' (yatzliach) - active vs passive causation?
