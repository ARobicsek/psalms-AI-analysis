# Verse-by-Verse Commentary: Psalm 1

## Verse 1

אַשְׁרֵי הָאִישׁ אֲשֶׁר לֹא הָלַךְ בַּעֲצַת רְשָׁעִים וּבְדֶרֶךְ חַטָּאִים לֹא עָמָד וּבְמוֹשַׁב לֵצִים לֹא יָשָׁב׃

The opening beatitude אַשְׁרֵי הָאִישׁ ("Happy is the person") establishes both the psalm's perspective and its fundamental concern with human flourishing. The term אַשְׁרֵי appears consistently in its plural form throughout Hebrew literature, as traditional commentators note, because true happiness encompasses multiple dimensions of well-being rather than isolated good fortune. Medieval exegete David Radak explains: "מלת אשרי היא לעולם בלשון רבים... כי לא יאשרו האדם בטובה אחת... אלא בטובות רבות" ("The word אשרי is always in plural form... because a person is not pronounced happy for one good thing... but for many good things").

The psalm's rhetorical strategy of defining righteousness through negation creates what amounts to a comprehensive taxonomy of moral corruption. The threefold progression—הָלַךְ ("walked"), עָמָד ("stood"), יָשָׁב ("sat")—traces an escalating trajectory from casual contact to settled commitment. As we see in the phonetic transcription (`'ash-rēy-hā-**'IY**-sh 'a-**SHER**  **LŌ'** hā-**LAKH** ba-ʿa-**TSATH** rə-shā-**ʿIY**-m`), the stress pattern creates a rhythmic emphasis on the negative לֹא and the key verbs, reinforcing the sense of deliberate avoidance.

Equally significant is the tripartite classification of evildoers: רְשָׁעִים ("wicked ones"), חַטָּאִים ("sinners"), and לֵצִים ("scoffers"). The BDB lexicon reveals that לֵצִים represents more than mere mockery—these are those who "scorn" and "delight in scorning," who are "incapable of discipline" and "cannot find wisdom." The Talmudic tradition preserved in Torah Temimah identifies this מוֹשַׁב לֵצִים ("seat of scoffers") with specific cultural institutions: "ההולך לאיצטדינין ולכרקום... הרי זה מושב לצים" ("One who goes to the stadium or circus... this is a seat of scoffers"), suggesting that the psalm targets not just individual moral failures but entire social systems that cultivate cynicism and frivolity.

The liturgical tradition has preserved this verse's opening phrase in the Simchat Torah Hakafot, where the community petitions: "ותזכנו שלא נלך בעצת רשעים" ("and merit us that we shall not walk in the counsel of the wicked"). This placement during the Torah's celebration suggests the tradition understood these opening warnings as foundational principles for approaching sacred study itself.

## Verse 2

כִּי אִם בְּתוֹרַת יְהוָה חֶפְצוֹ וּבְתוֹרָתוֹ יֶהְגֶּה יוֹמָם וָלָיְלָה׃

The emphatic כִּי אִם ("but rather") creates a dramatic pivot from the preceding negations to positive engagement. The verb חָפֵץ, meaning "to delight" or "take pleasure," suggests far more than intellectual assent—it implies passionate attachment and emotional investment. The phonetic transcription reveals the stress falling on key terms: `**KIY** 'im-bə-thō-**RATH** yə-hō-**WĀH** ḥef-**TSŌ**`, emphasizing both the divine source (יְהוָה) and the human response (חֶפְצוֹ).

The subtle shift from תוֹרַת יְהוָה ("Torah of YHWH") to תוֹרָתוֹ ("his Torah") has generated extensive commentary. Rashi preserves the Talmudic reading: "בתחלה היא נקראת תורת ה׳, ומשעמל בה היא נקראת תורתו" ("Initially it is called Torah of YHWH, and after he has labored in it, it is called his Torah"). This transformation suggests that Torah study involves a progressive internalization—divine instruction becomes personally integrated through sustained engagement.

The verb יֶהְגֶּה carries rich connotations beyond silent meditation. The BDB lexicon defines הגה as "moan, growl, utter, speak, muse," noting its onomatopoetic quality. Rashi explains: "כל לשון הגה בלב הוא" ("Every expression of הגה refers to the heart"), but the lexical evidence suggests vocal engagement—"moaning," "uttering," even "muttering." This implies that proper Torah engagement involves embodied, vocalized interaction with the text, not merely cerebral analysis.

The temporal phrase יוֹמָם וָלָיְלָה ("day and night") functions as a merism—a figure of speech where contrasting parts represent the whole, indicating continuous engagement. This appears 23 times across Scripture as an idiom for perpetual activity, from God's cosmic governance (Genesis 8:22) to human devotion (Joshua 1:8). The Torah Temimah preserves Talmudic discussions about the practical implications of this phrase, including debates about marital obligations for Torah scholars who literally embody this ideal of constant study.

The verse's placement in Jewish liturgy reveals its foundational importance: it appears in the complete Psalm 1 recitation during Yom Kippur evening prayers, where the theme of choosing between paths becomes particularly resonant on the Day of Atonement.

## Verse 3

וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ וְעָלֵהוּ לֹא־יִבּוֹל וְכֹל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ׃

The tree metaphor that dominates this verse creates one of Scripture's most memorable images of human flourishing. The comparison is explicit—כְּעֵץ ("like a tree")—establishing a simile that extends through multiple characteristics. The phonetic stress pattern (`wə-hā-**YĀH** kə-**ʿĒTS** shā-**THŪL**`) emphasizes both the transformation (הָיָה) and the primary metaphor (עֵץ).

The descriptor שָׁתוּל ("planted") proves crucial for the metaphor's meaning. Unlike naturally occurring vegetation, this tree represents intentional cultivation. The Klein Dictionary confirms שָׁתוּל as the passive participle of שָׁתַל ("to transplant"), suggesting divine agency in the righteous person's positioning. They are not accidentally well-situated but deliberately placed where they can thrive.

The phrase עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם ("beside streams of water") evokes irrigation channels rather than natural water sources. The term פַּלְגֵי derives from פָּלַג ("to divide"), indicating artificial waterways that channel water for agricultural purposes. This image appears across Scripture in contexts of reliable provision—Psalm 46:4 describes "streams" (פַּלְגֵי) that "gladden the city of God," while Isaiah 32:2 promises leaders who will be "like streams of water in a dry place." The metaphor suggests not dependence on sporadic rainfall but access to channeled, consistent nourishment.

The tree's threefold blessing creates a portrait of comprehensive success: seasonal fruit production (פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ), unfading foliage (עָלֵהוּ לֹא־יִבּוֹל), and universal prosperity (כֹל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ). Rashi's commentary on the unfading leaves proves particularly insightful: "אפלו הפסלת שבו לצרך היא. שיחתן של תלמידי חכמים לצרך היא וצריכה למוד" ("Even the inferior part of it serves a purpose. The conversation of Torah scholars is essential and requires study"). This suggests that every aspect of the righteous person's life—even casual speech—becomes meaningful.

The verse appears prominently in Jewish liturgy, particularly in the Tefillat Geshem (Prayer for Rain) on Shemini Atzeret, where the community petitions: "ברכתו כעץ שתול על פלגי מים" ("Blessed him like a tree planted by streams of water"). This liturgical placement connects the psalm's agricultural imagery with seasonal prayers for rain, demonstrating how tradition understood the metaphor as fundamentally about divine provision of life-sustaining resources.

## Verse 4

לֹא־כֵן הָרְשָׁעִים כִּי אִם־כַּמֹּץ אֲשֶׁר־תִּדְּפֶנּוּ רוּחַ׃

The stark brevity of this verse creates a powerful rhetorical contrast with the preceding elaborate tree metaphor. Where the righteous received extended description through multiple images of flourishing, the wicked merit exactly fourteen Hebrew words. The opening לֹא־כֵן ("Not so") functions as an emphatic negation, rejecting every aspect of the righteous person's stability and success.

The phonetic transcription (`lō'-**KHĒN** hā-rə-shā-**ʿIY**-m **KIY** 'im-kam-**MŌTS**`) reveals stress on the key terms of negation (KHĒN) and comparison (MŌTS), emphasizing the verse's contrastive function. The comparative particle כַּ creates an explicit simile—they are "like chaff"—but the simplicity of this comparison against the tree's complexity suggests the fundamental insubstantiality of wickedness itself.

Chaff (מֹּץ) appears throughout Scripture as an image of worthlessness and impermanence. The Klein Dictionary confirms that מֹּץ represents the "worthless byproduct" of grain processing, easily separated from valuable grain and discarded. The figurative language database reveals this image appears in similar contexts across Scripture—Psalm 35:5 petitions that enemies "be as chaff in the wind," while Isaiah 41:2 describes conquered armies as "chaff" that bows can drive away. The consistency of this imagery suggests a conventional metaphor for vulnerability and insignificance.

The verb תִּדְּפֶנּוּ derives from נדף, meaning "to drive away" or "scatter." The BDB lexicon notes this term's association with violent dispersal—chaff is not gently moved but forcefully blown about. The wind (רוּחַ) functions as an uncontrollable natural force that renders human agency irrelevant. Where the tree's roots provided stability against all environmental pressures, the wicked possess no anchoring system to resist even natural forces.

Ibn Ezra's commentary proves particularly insightful: "והנה נפש הצדיק דומה אל הדגן שהוא עומד והרשעים כתבן לפני הרוח" ("And behold, the soul of the righteous is comparable to grain that stands, while the wicked are like straw before the wind"). This observation highlights the metaphor's agricultural coherence—grain remains after processing, while chaff disappears, representing the ultimate sorting that reveals what possesses lasting value.

The Torah Temimah preserves a Talmudic application of this verse that extends its meaning: it records debates about whether those who fail to study Torah properly are included in this category of the "wicked" who are "like chaff." This interpretive move suggests the tradition understood the psalm's two ways as fundamentally about engagement with divine instruction.

## Verse 5

עַל־כֵן לֹא־יָקֻמוּ רְשָׁעִים בַּמִּשְׁפָּט וְחַטָּאִים בַּעֲדַת צַדִּיקִים׃

The causal עַל־כֵן ("Therefore") directly connects the wicked's chaff-like nature to their ultimate fate, creating a logical progression from character to consequence. The verse introduces judicial language that shifts the psalm's perspective from present moral choices to final accountability. The phonetic pattern (`ʿal-**KĒN**  lō'-yā-**QU**-mū rə-shā-ʿiy-**M** bam-mish-**PĀT**`) places stress on the key terms of causation (KĒN), negation (QU), and judgment (PĀT).

The verb יָקֻמוּ ("stand") creates deliberate irony within the psalm's structure. In verse 1, the righteous person was described as one who "did not stand" (לֹא עָמָד) in the path of sinners—now the wicked cannot "stand" (לֹא־יָקֻמוּ) in judgment. The same physical posture that represented moral compromise for the righteous becomes impossible for the wicked in the context of divine evaluation. The BDB lexicon reveals that קום in judicial contexts means "to maintain oneself" or "be established," suggesting not merely physical posture but the ability to endure scrutiny.

The term מִשְׁפָּט carries rich semantic range beyond simple "judgment." While often rendered as "court proceeding," the BDB lexicon includes meanings of "justice," "ordinance," and "custom." Ibn Ezra's commentary interprets this as "יום הדין, והוא יום המיתה" ("the day of judgment, which is the day of death"), suggesting the term encompasses both present moral evaluation and ultimate accountability. Radak similarly explains that judgment refers to "ביום הדין... לא תהיה להם תקומה" ("on the Day of Judgment... they will have no rising").

The parallel clause introduces עֲדַת צַדִּיקִים ("assembly of the righteous"), creating a double exclusion. Not only can the wicked not endure judgment individually, but sinners (חַטָּאִים) cannot participate in the righteous community. The term עֵדָה, according to the BDB lexicon, refers to a "congregation" or "company assembled together by appointment," suggesting intentional gathering rather than accidental association. The Torah Temimah preserves Talmudic discussions connecting this verse to questions about resurrection and the World to Come, demonstrating how Jewish tradition understood these exclusions as having ultimate metaphysical significance.

The structure creates a chiastic arrangement where the wicked (רְשָׁעִים) face individual judgment while sinners (חַטָּאִים) face communal exclusion, suggesting that moral failure operates both personally and socially. Medieval commentator Malbim explains the distinction: the wicked cannot stand "even individually" in judgment, while sinners, though they might survive individual evaluation, cannot participate in the community of the righteous when measured against that higher standard.

## Verse 6

כִּי־יוֹדֵעַ יְהוָה דֶּרֶךְ צַדִּיקִים וְדֶרֶךְ רְשָׁעִים תֹּאבֵד׃

The concluding verse provides the theological foundation for everything preceding, explaining why the psalm's binary classification holds ultimate validity. The causal כִּי ("for/because") connects divine knowledge to the entire argument about two ways of existence. The phonetic transcription (`kiy-yō-**DHĒ**-aʿ yə-hō-**WĀH** **DE**-rekh tsa-diy-**QIY**-m`) places stress on the key verb of knowing (DHĒ) and divine name (WĀH), emphasizing both the cognitive activity and its subject.

The verb יוֹדֵעַ carries profound theological significance beyond mere intellectual awareness. In biblical Hebrew, "knowing" implies intimate relationship, active care, and continuous involvement. The BDB lexicon includes meanings of "acknowledge," "recognize," and "have regard for." Radak's commentary proves particularly illuminating: "פרוש יודע: מכיר ומשגיח להיטיב להם" ("The meaning of 'knows' is: recognizes and pays attention to do good to them"). This divine knowing represents providential care, not distant observation.

The parallel structure creates perfect symmetry: YHWH knows the way of the righteous / the way of the wicked perishes. This asymmetry proves deliberate—where the righteous receive active divine attention, the wicked experience active destruction without divine intervention. The verb תֹּאבֵד ("perishes") comes from אבד, which the BDB lexicon defines as "perish, die" with connotations of being "exterminated" or "destroyed." This is not passive fading but active elimination.

The term דֶּרֶךְ ("way") creates an inclusio with verse 1's implicit reference to paths, framing the entire psalm around the metaphor of life as a journey with distinct destinations. This "way" terminology appears throughout Wisdom literature as a fundamental category for understanding human existence—Proverbs 14:12 warns that "there is a way that seems right to a person, but its end is the way to death," while Psalm 25:8-9 celebrates how YHWH "instructs sinners in the way" and "guides the humble in what is right."

Ibn Ezra's commentary raises profound questions about divine omniscience and moral order: since God knows both universals and particulars, the "knowing" mentioned here must indicate something beyond mere cognition. He suggests it represents God's active choice to sustain righteous souls eternally while allowing wicked souls to perish, making divine knowledge simultaneously epistemic and ontological.

The verse's placement as the psalm's conclusion suggests that human moral choices operate within the context of divine governance. The two ways are not merely human constructions but reflect the fundamental structure of reality as God has ordained it. The righteous way receives divine attention and care, ensuring its permanence, while the wicked way contains within itself the seeds of its own destruction.

Traditional Jewish liturgy preserves this verse within the complete Psalm 1 recitation during Yom Kippur evening prayers, where the theme of divine knowledge and ultimate accountability becomes particularly resonant on the Day of Atonement. The liturgical context suggests the tradition understood this concluding statement as both comfort for the righteous and warning for those who have strayed from the proper path.
