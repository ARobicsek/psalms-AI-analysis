# Verse-by-Verse Commentary: Psalm 1

## Verse 1

**אַשְׁרֵי־הָאִישׁ אֲשֶׁר לֹא הָלַךְ בַּעֲצַת רְשָׁעִים; וּבְדֶרֶךְ חַטָּאִים לֹא עָמָד; וּבְמוֹשַׁב לֵצִים לֹא יָשָׁב׃**

The psalm opens with a beatitude—אַשְׁרֵי (ashrei), a plural construct form that literally means "the happinesses of" or "the blessednesses of." This grammatical choice is significant. Rashi explains that the plural indicates not a single blessing but a "collection of blessings" (קבוץ הצלחות), suggesting that true happiness is never found in one isolated good but in a convergence of many forms of flourishing. The opening word establishes the psalm's genre as wisdom literature, belonging to the macarism tradition that pervades biblical Wisdom books (cf. Proverbs 3:13: אַשְׁרֵי אָדָם מָצָא חָכְמָה, "Happy is the one who finds wisdom").

The verse's structure is built on a triadic progression of negation, each clause opening with לֹא (lo, "not"). The threefold repetition creates an emphatic drumbeat of avoidance—a rhetorical device known as anaphora. But the progression is not simply repetitive; it traces an escalating pattern of entanglement in wickedness through three verbs of motion and position: הָלַךְ (halakh, "walked"), עָמָד ('amad, "stood"), and יָשָׁב (yashav, "sat"). Ibn Ezra, drawing on the Talmud (Avodah Zarah 18b), interprets this sequence as depicting progressive stages of moral compromise: first, the wandering step toward wickedness; then, the pause to consider; finally, the settled residence among the corrupt. The blessed person has resisted all three stages.

The three categories of the wicked similarly suggest escalation. רְשָׁעִים (resha'im, "wicked") denotes those who act in moral defiance; חַטָּאִים (chatta'im, "sinners") refers to those who miss the moral mark, whether deliberately or carelessly; and לֵצִים (leitzim, "scoffers" or "insolent ones") represents the most corrosive type—those who mock divine truth itself. BDB notes that לֵצִים specifically refers to those who are "proud and haughty" and "incapable of discipline." The figurative language database reveals this term appears 17 times across Scripture, predominantly in Proverbs, where it consistently describes those who reject correction (Proverbs 9:7-8: הוֹכִיחַ לֵץ לֹקֵחַ לוֹ קָלוֹן, "Whoever corrects a scoffer earns insult").

Each category of the wicked is paired with a distinct social space: עֲצַת (atzat, "counsel"), דֶּרֶךְ (derekh, "way"), and מוֹשַׁב (moshav, "seat" or "dwelling place"). The progression moves from the abstract (counsel—mere ideas) to the concrete (a physical seat—permanent habitation). The blessed person has avoided not only the wicked themselves but also the intellectual, social, and physical spaces they inhabit.

This opening verse introduces the psalm's central concern: דֶּרֶךְ (derekh, "way"), which will form an inclusio with verse 6. The "way of sinners" mentioned here will be contrasted with the "way of the righteous" that God "knows" (v. 6) and the "way of the wicked" that perishes. This inclusio frames the entire psalm as a meditation on two divergent paths through life.

The verse's liturgical afterlife is revealing. In the Edot HaMizrach tradition, this verse appears in Pirkei Avot studies on Shabbat afternoons, where the phrase וּבְמוֹשַׁב לֵצִים לֹא יָשָׁב is cited as scriptural proof for the rabbinic teaching: "When people sit together without words of Torah between them, behold this is a gathering of scoffers" (שֶׁיּוֹשְׁבִין וְאֵין בֵּינֵיהֶם דִּבְרֵי תוֹרָה, הֲרֵי זֶה מוֹשַׁב לֵצִים). This transforms the Psalmist's warning against association with mockers into a positive exhortation toward continuous Torah engagement in all social gatherings.

## Verse 2

**כִּי אִם בְּתוֹרַת יהוה חֶפְצוֹ; וּבְתוֹרָתוֹ יֶהְגֶּה יוֹמָם וָלָיְלָה׃**

The sharp pivot from negative to positive is marked by the adversative כִּי אִם (ki im, "but rather" or "on the contrary"). After the threefold negation of verse 1, the psalm now establishes what the blessed person *does* pursue. The phonetic transcription reveals an interesting sonic pattern here: **KIY** 'im-bə-thō-**RATH** yə-hō-**WĀH** ḥef-**TSŌ**. The stressed syllables fall on KIY, RATH (Torah), WĀH (the divine name), and TSŌ (his desire), creating a rhythmic emphasis on the key theological concepts of this line—the conjunction, Torah, God's name, and the affective term "delight."

The term חֶפְצוֹ (cheftzo, "his delight" or "his desire") is crucial. BDB notes that חֵפֶץ (chefetz) denotes not mere compliance or duty but affective engagement—"delight" or "pleasure." It appears in contexts of things desired (Proverbs 3:15: מִכָּל־חֲפָצִים, "more than all precious things") and of God's own will (Isaiah 53:10: חֵפֶץ יהוה בְּיָדוֹ יִצְלַח, "the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand"). The Malbim observes that this affective dimension is essential: the psalm does not merely demand Torah *observance* but Torah *love*. The righteous person's engagement with divine teaching is not compulsory but volitional and joyful.

The second colon introduces the practice that flows from this delight: וּבְתוֹרָתוֹ יֶהְגֶּה יוֹמָם וָלָיְלָה (u've-torato yehgeh yomam va-laylah, "and on his Torah he meditates day and night"). The verb יֶהְגֶּה (yehgeh) is richly ambiguous. Klein's lexicon notes it means "to hum, murmur, ponder," carrying connotations of both vocalized recitation and internal contemplation. The verb appears elsewhere describing the growl of a lion (Isaiah 31:4: כַּאֲשֶׁר יֶהְגֶּה הָאַרְיֵה, "as a lion growls") and the cooing of a dove, suggesting a physical, embodied act of speech. Rashi, following the Talmud, states: "Every expression of הגה refers to the heart" (כל לשון הגה בלב הוא), yet the examples he cites include both internal meditation and audible utterance. Ancient Jewish practice understood Torah study as always vocalized—a "murmuring" aloud that engaged both mind and mouth, not silent reading in the modern sense.

A subtle but significant textual shift occurs within the verse. In the first colon, the text reads בְּתוֹרַת יהוה (be-torat Adonai, "in the Torah of the Lord"); in the second, it shifts to וּבְתוֹרָתוֹ (u've-torato, "and in *his* Torah"). The Talmud (Avodah Zarah 19a) seized on this grammatical detail: "In the beginning it is called 'the Torah of the Lord,' and after he has toiled in it, it is called 'his Torah'" (בתחלה היא נקראת תורת ה׳, ומשעמל בה היא נקראת תורתו). Through intensive engagement, the divine teaching becomes internalized—it becomes "his own." This is not appropriation but transformation through study; the Torah becomes part of the person's very being.

The phrase יוֹמָם וָלָיְלָה (yomam va-laylah, "day and night") functions as a merismus, a rhetorical device expressing totality through polar opposites. This continuous engagement with Torah appears programmatically in Joshua 1:8: לֹא־יָמוּשׁ סֵפֶר הַתּוֹרָה הַזֶּה מִפִּיךָ וְהָגִיתָ בּוֹ יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה (lo-yamush sefer ha-torah ha-zeh mi-pikha ve-hagita bo yomam va-laylah, "this book of the teaching shall not depart from your mouth, and you shall meditate on it day and night"). The verbal link (הגה in both texts) and the identical temporal formula create an intertextual echo, suggesting that the blessed person of Psalm 1 embodies the Josuanic ideal of leadership through Torah devotion.

This verse appears prominently in Jewish liturgy. It is recited as part of the Yom Kippur evening service in multiple traditions, both Ashkenazic and Edot HaMizrach, where the psalm as a whole serves as an opening meditation on righteous conduct during the most solemn moment of the Jewish calendar. The choice to recite this verse on the Day of Atonement underscores the tradition's understanding that Torah meditation is not an academic exercise but the essential practice that defines the covenant community.

## Verse 3

**וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי מָיִם; אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ, וְעָלֵהוּ לֹא־יִבּוֹל; וְכֹל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ׃**

The psalm now unfolds an extended simile, the first of two contrasting emblematic images that structure the composition. The righteous person "shall be like a tree" (כְּעֵץ, ke-etz)—not *any* tree, but one that is שָׁתוּל (shatul, "planted" or "transplanted"). The passive participle is theologically loaded. BDB notes that שָׁתַל (shatal) means "to transplant," suggesting deliberate positioning by an external agent. Unlike a wild tree that grows where its seed falls, this tree has been *placed* by a gardener. The implication is subtle but profound: the righteous person's flourishing is not self-generated but divinely orchestrated. Radak comments: "The good man is compared to a tree planted upon streams of water, saying that the man who departs from evil and does good is like a tree planted upon streams of water which is continually satisfied" (האדם הטוב לעץ השתול על פלגי מים... כן הוא ישמח לעולם בחלקו).

The passive voice recurs at the end of the verse: יַצְלִיחַ (yatzliach, "it/he will prosper"), which can refer either to the tree or to the person. This grammatical ambiguity collapses the distinction between vehicle and target, allowing the metaphor to do its work seamlessly. The tree's thriving *is* the person's thriving.

The tree is positioned עַל־פַּלְגֵי מָיִם ('al-palgei mayim, "beside streams of water"). The plural פַּלְגֵי (palgei, "streams" or "channels") suggests abundance—not a single trickle but multiple watercourses. Ibn Ezra glosses this as: "beside streams of water means beside one of the streams, similar to [other biblical constructions where] 'the innermost parts of the ship' (Jonah 1:5)" (על פלגי מים - על אחת הפלגים). But the plural likely conveys profusion: this tree is surrounded by water on all sides, never at risk of drought.

The figurative language database reveals that tree imagery is pervasive in Scripture, appearing 100 times as a vehicle for human flourishing or destruction. A particularly striking parallel occurs in Psalm 92:13-14: צַדִּיק כַּתָּמָר יִפְרָח, כְּאֶרֶז בַּלְּבָנוֹן יִשְׂגֶּה. שְׁתוּלִים בְּבֵית יהוה, בְּחַצְרוֹת אֱלֹהֵינוּ יַפְרִיחוּ ("The righteous bloom like a date-palm, they thrive like a cedar in Lebanon. Planted in the house of the Lord, they flourish in the courts of our God"). The intertextual link is unmistakable: both psalms employ the root שתל (sh-t-l, "planted"), both describe flourishing vegetation, and both apply this imagery to the righteous. But Psalm 92 makes explicit what Psalm 1 implies—the "planted" ones are positioned specifically in proximity to God's dwelling, the Temple. The "streams of water" in Psalm 1 may thus represent more than natural irrigation; they symbolize the sustaining flow of divine teaching that "streams" from God's sanctuary.

The tree's characteristics are enumerated in three positive assertions. First, אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ (asher piryo yitten be-'itto, "which yields its fruit in its season"). The emphasis on בְּעִתּוֹ (be-'itto, "in its season" or "at its proper time") suggests not merely productivity but *timely* productivity—fruit that arrives when it should, neither premature nor delayed. Radak explains: "For the tree that is in a place of thirst and depends on rain, when the rain does not fall according to need, it will not give its fruit in its season, but its fruit will be delayed and late because of its thirst; but the tree planted upon streams of water gives its fruit in its season and is never late" (כי העץ שהוא במקום צמא ומקוה למטר... אבל העץ השתול על פלגי מים פריו יתן בעתו ולא יתאחר לעולם).

Second, וְעָלֵהוּ לֹא־יִבּוֹל (ve-'alehu lo-yivol, "and its foliage does not wither"). The verb יִבּוֹל (yivol) comes from the root נבל (n-b-l), meaning "to wither" or "to fade." BDB notes this root describes the wilting of vegetation and, by extension, the decline of people (Isaiah 1:30: כְּאֵלָה נֹבֶלֶת עָלֶהָ, "like a terebinth whose leaves wither"). The figurative language database contains seven instances of withering-plant metaphors, most depicting human fragility (e.g., Psalm 102:12: וַאֲנִי כָּעֵשֶׂב אִיבָשׁ, "I wither like grass"). Here, the *negation* of withering—לֹא־יִבּוֹל—becomes a statement of permanence. Rashi, drawing on rabbinic tradition, offers a striking comment: "Even the inferior part of it serves a purpose. The conversation of Torah scholars is essential and requires study" (אפלו הפסלת שבו לצורך היא. שיחתן של תלמידי חכמים לצורך היא וצריכה לימוד). That is, even the "leaves" (the seemingly peripheral aspects) of the righteous person have value—their casual discourse, their "small talk," contains wisdom.

Third, וְכֹל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ (ve-khol asher-ya'aseh yatzliach, "and whatever it/he produces thrives"). The verb צלח (tz-l-ch), "to prosper" or "to succeed," appears 65 times in Scripture, often describing divinely granted success (Genesis 39:2-3: וַיְהִי יהוה אֶת־יוֹסֵף וַיְהִי אִישׁ מַצְלִיחַ, "The Lord was with Joseph, and he was a successful man"). The comprehensive scope—כֹל אֲשֶׁר (kol asher, "all that")—parallels Genesis 39:3's description of Joseph's divinely blessed prosperity.

This verse's liturgical use is particularly rich. In the Edot HaMizrach Rosh Hashanah night Kiddush ceremony, the verse is cited in full as scriptural support following the supplications "Please, O Lord, save us; please, O Lord, grant us success" (אָנָּא יהוה הוֹשִׁיעָה נָּא, אָנָּא יהוה הַצְלִיחָה נָא). The verse functions as a prooftext for blessing and prosperity in the coming year, transforming the wisdom psalm's individual imagery of the flourishing tree into a collective petition for divine favor. Additionally, the phrase כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי מָיִם appears in the Tefillat Geshem (Prayer for Rain) on Shemini Atzeret: זְכוֹר אָב נִמְשַׁךְ אַחֲרֶיךָ כַּמַּיִם. בֵּרַכְתּוֹ כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל פַּלְגֵי מַיִם ("Remember the father drawn after You like waters; You blessed him like a tree planted by streams of water"). Here, the psalmist's botanical metaphor for individual righteousness becomes a petition recalling God's covenantal care for the patriarchs, linking the promise of flourishing to the seasonal agricultural need for rain.

The aesthetic contrast with the description of the wicked (v. 4) is deliberate and striking. The righteous receive three full verses (vv. 1-3) of elaborate, lush imagery: a tree rooted by abundant water, bearing timely fruit, with unfading leaves. This expansive treatment *performs* the message of substantiality, depth, and permanence. The wicked, by contrast, will receive barely half a verse of sparse description.

## Verse 4

**לֹא־כֵן הָרְשָׁעִים; כִּי אִם־כַּמֹּץ אֲשֶׁר־תִּדְּפֶנּוּ רוּחַ׃**

The dramatic shift is marked by לֹא־כֵן (lo-khen, "not so")—a stark contrast particle that negates everything that preceded. After three verses devoted to the righteous, the wicked receive a single, terse simile. The form enacts the message: insubstantiality is expressed through brevity. The phonetic transcription reveals this compression: lō'-**KHĒN** hā-rə-shā-**ʿIY**-m **KIY** 'im-kam-**MŌTS** 'a-sher-tid-**FEN**-nū **RŪ**-aḥ. The stressed syllables fall on KHĒN (contrast), 'IY (wicked), MŌTS (chaff), FEN (drives), and RŪ (wind)—a staccato rhythm of negation and dispersal.

The wicked are likened to כַּמֹּץ (ka-motz, "like chaff"). BDB defines מֹץ (motz) as the light, dry husks separated from grain during threshing—agricultural waste with no weight, value, or substance. Klein's lexicon connects this to Aramaic מוֹצָא and Arabic mauṣ, all denoting the worthless byproduct of the harvest. The figurative language database reveals that chaff imagery appears six times in Scripture as a vehicle for fragility and judgment, always depicting entities blown away effortlessly by wind or storm. Isaiah 17:13 provides a classic formulation: כְּמֹץ הָרִים לִפְנֵי־רוּחַ וּכְגַלְגַּל לִפְנֵי סוּפָה (ke-motz harim lifnei-ruach u-khe-galgal lifnei sufah, "like chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like whirling dust before the storm"). Psalm 35:5 employs nearly identical language: יִהְיוּ כְּמֹץ לִפְנֵי־רוּחַ, וּמַלְאַךְ יהוה דּוֹחֶה ("Let them be as chaff before the wind, the angel of the Lord driving them on").

The verb תִּדְּפֶנּוּ (tiddefennu, "drives it away") suggests effortless dispersal. BDB notes the root נדף (n-d-f) means "to drive away" or "to scatter," often by wind. Klein adds that it can also mean "to evaporate" or "to vanish"—the chaff not only moves but *disappears*. The subject is רוּחַ (ruach, "wind" or "spirit"), which can denote physical wind or, theologically, the divine breath (Genesis 1:2: וְרוּחַ אֱלֹהִים מְרַחֶפֶת עַל־פְּנֵי הַמָּיִם, "and the spirit/wind of God hovered over the face of the waters"). In this context, the ambiguity may be intentional: is this a natural wind or a divine force? The threshing floor, where chaff is separated from grain, is a well-known biblical site of judgment (Ruth 3; 2 Samuel 24:18-25), reinforcing the judicial overtones.

Radak offers a telling comment on the asymmetry: "He says that the wicked... are not so, for the children of men are not profited by them and by their good (fortune), but they (only) do them harm. Their impulse also for evil is like the chaff—that is, the light stubble in the straw, which is no use to the sons of men, and the wind drives it away quickly, and it does harm by its motion" (אמר: כי הרשעים... אינם כן, כי לא יהנו מהם בני אדם ומטובתם, אבל יזיקו להם). The wicked are not merely unproductive; they are *harmful*. Like chaff, they contribute nothing and may even injure those around them (perhaps by blowing into eyes or contaminating clean spaces).

The structural asymmetry is the verse's most powerful rhetorical feature. The righteous received: (1) a negative definition (v. 1), (2) a positive alternative (v. 2), and (3) an elaborate, multi-clause simile with four positive attributes (v. 3). The wicked receive: (1) a negation (לֹא־כֵן), (2) a single-clause simile, and (3) no elaboration. This disproportion is not a compositional flaw but a deliberate aesthetic choice that *performs* the psalm's theological claim. Substantiality requires description; insubstantiality reveals itself through absence. The brevity itself communicates the wicked's ontological emptiness.

The Malbim, always alert to grammatical nuance, notes that the particle כִּי אִם (ki im, "but rather" or "on the contrary") before כַּמֹּץ (ka-motz) is distinctive. He argues that this construction emphasizes *total contrast*—not merely "they are different" but "they are the *opposite*." Where the righteous are rooted, the wicked are uprooted; where the righteous bear fruit, the wicked produce waste; where the righteous endure, the wicked vanish.

The threshing-floor imagery connects this verse to eschatological judgment traditions. Malachi 3:19-21 employs similar agricultural metaphors: כִּי־הִנֵּה הַיּוֹם בָּא בֹּעֵר כַּתַּנּוּר, וְהָיוּ כָל־זֵדִים וְכָל־עֹשֵׂה רִשְׁעָה קַשׁ ("For behold, the day comes, burning like an oven, when all the arrogant and all evildoers will be stubble"). The prophet's "stubble" (קַשׁ, qash) is synonymous with "chaff" (מֹץ, motz), both denoting the dry, combustible remnants of the harvest. In this prophetic context, the wicked's insubstantiality is not merely a present condition but a preview of eschatological destruction—they will be burned in the coming fire of judgment.

## Verse 5

**עַל־כֵּן לֹא־יָקֻמוּ רְשָׁעִים בַּמִּשְׁפָּט; וְחַטָּאִים בַּעֲדַת צַדִּיקִֽים׃**

The particle עַל־כֵּן ('al-ken, "therefore") signals consequence—a logical inference drawn from the chaff imagery of verse 4. Because the wicked are insubstantial like wind-blown chaff, לֹא־יָקֻמוּ (lo-yakumu, "they will not stand" or "they will not rise"). The phonetic transcription shows: ʿal-**KĒN** lō'-yā-**QU**-mū rə-shā-ʿiy-**M** bam-mish-**PĀT**. The stressed syllables emphasize KĒN (therefore), QU (rise), M (wicked), and PĀT (judgment)—the logical progression from consequence to judicial outcome.

The verb יָקֻמוּ (yakumu, from the root קום, q-w-m) is multiply ambiguous, and this ambiguity has sparked significant interpretive debate. BDB lists several semantic ranges for קום: "to arise, stand up, stand; to be established, confirmed; to endure." In forensic contexts, it can mean "to stand (in court)" as in Deuteronomy 19:15: לֹא־יָקוּם עֵד אֶחָד בְּאִישׁ ("a single witness shall not stand against a person"). But the verb can also mean "to rise" in the sense of resurrection, as suggested by Job 19:25: וְאַחֲרוֹן עַל־עָפָר יָקוּם ("and at last he will stand upon the dust")—a phrase often read as describing eschatological vindication. The concordance search for לא יקומו yields five biblical instances, including Numbers 30:6, where it describes the invalidation of a vow (לֹא יָקוּם, "it shall not stand"), and Job 25:3, where it refers to God's light "rising" universally.

Does בַּמִּשְׁפָּט (ba-mishpat, "in the judgment") refer to earthly legal proceedings, divine judgment, or eschatological vindication? The term מִשְׁפָּט (mishpat) spans all three domains. It can denote a court case (Deuteronomy 1:17: לֹֽא־תַכִּירוּ פָנִים בַּמִּשְׁפָּט, "you shall not be partial in judgment"), God's moral governance (Psalm 9:8: וְהוּא יִשְׁפֹּט־תֵּבֵל בְּצֶדֶק, "He judges the world in righteousness"), or the eschatological Day of Judgment (Ecclesiastes 12:14: כִּי אֶת־כָּל־מַעֲשֶׂה הָאֱלֹהִים יָבִיא בְמִשְׁפָּט, "for God will bring every deed into judgment").

Radak, following medieval Jewish exegesis, interprets this verse eschatologically: "Therefore, since the wicked walk in an evil way in this world, they shall not rise up in the Judgment: He means to say, in the Day of Judgment, and that is the day of death, they shall have no rising again" (על כן שהולכים הרשעים בדרך רע בעולם הזה לא יקמו במשפט רצונו לומר: ביום הדין, והוא יום המיתה, לא תהיה להם תקומה). In this reading, the wicked lack תְּחִיַּת הַמֵּתִים (tehiyat ha-metim, "resurrection of the dead")—their insubstantiality in life becomes literal non-being in the afterlife. The Talmud (Sanhedrin 107b) debates precisely this point, citing our verse: "The men of Sodom have no share in the World to Come... but they do stand in judgment. Rabbi Nehemiah says: Neither these nor those stand in judgment, as it is stated: 'Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous'" (אנשי סדום אין להם חלק לעולם הבא... אבל עומדין בדין. ר׳ נחמיה אומר אלו ואלו אין עומדין בדין שנאמר על כן לא יקומו רשעים במשפט וחטאים בעדת צדיקים). The halakhic discussion turns on whether our verse predicts exclusion from the eschatological assembly, from judgment itself, or both.

The second colon shifts from the רְשָׁעִים (resha'im, "wicked") to the חַטָּאִים (chatta'im, "sinners"), echoing the first verse's triadic categorization. These חַטָּאִים will not be found בַּעֲדַת צַדִּיקִים (ba-'adat tzaddikim, "in the assembly of the righteous"). The term עֲדַת ('adat, "assembly" or "congregation") has both cultic and eschatological resonances. BDB notes that עֵדָה ('edah) frequently refers to liturgical or covenant assemblies in the Psalter. In Psalm 22:26, the psalmist vows: אֲהַלֶּלְךָ בְּקָהָל רָב, בְּעַם עָצוּם אֲשַׁלְּמֶנָּה ("I will praise You in the great congregation; among a mighty people I will fulfill [my vows]"). Psalm 89:6 employs עֲדַת־קְדֹשִׁים ('adat-kedoshim, "assembly of the holy ones") to describe a heavenly council. Our verse's עֲדַת צַדִּיקִים may thus denote a cultic gathering (sinners excluded from communal worship), an earthly community of the righteous, or an eschatological assembly of the vindicated.

The Meiri offers a distinctive ethical reading: "The wicked and sinners who are drawn after wealth do not have an enduring success, and even in this world their success is not constant, but quickly perishes like chaff which the wind drives away... Thus, they will not rise up in judgment with the congregation of the righteous to be likened to them in one judgment" (הרשעים... לא יקומו... במשפט... אחר שאין מעשיהם פונים לתכלית טוב... לא תהיה להם... תקומה במשפט... בעת המשפט... עם עדת הצדיקים בשוה). In his reading, the verse predicts not metaphysical exclusion but moral-ontological incomparability—the wicked simply cannot be "measured" by the same standard as the righteous because they pursue different ends.

The verse's liturgical use is revealing. It appears within the Yom Kippur liturgy as part of the complete recitation of Psalm 1, where the psalm functions as an opening meditation on righteous conduct. On the Day of Atonement, when the community seeks divine mercy and stands symbolically before the heavenly court, this verse's forensic language—"they shall not stand in the judgment"—takes on urgent, existential weight. The choice to recite this psalm on Yom Kippur suggests the tradition understood it as describing not merely earthly prosperity but one's standing before the ultimate Judge.

## Verse 6

**כִּֽי־יוֹדֵעַ יהוה דֶּרֶךְ צַדִּיקִים; וְדֶרֶךְ רְשָׁעִים תֹּאבֵֽד׃**

The particle כִּי (ki) introduces the theological foundation for everything that preceded. The entire psalm's binary—the flourishing tree versus the scattered chaff, the righteous assembly versus the excluded sinners—is now grounded not in human moral effort but in a divine reality: כִּֽי־יוֹדֵעַ יהוה דֶּרֶךְ צַדִּיקִים (ki yodea Adonai derekh tzaddikim, "for the Lord *knows* the way of the righteous"). The phonetic transcription is: kiy-yō-**DHĒ**-aʿ yə-hō-**WĀH** **DE**-rekh tsa-diy-**QIY**-m. The stressed syllables fall on DHĒ (knows), WĀH (the divine name), DE (way), and QIY (righteous)—a rhythmic emphasis on knowing, God, path, and the righteous.

The verb יוֹדֵעַ (yodea, "knows") is the psalm's hinge. What does it mean for God to "know" a way? BDB notes that ידע (y-d-') in biblical Hebrew is far richer than mere cognitive awareness. The verb denotes intimate, experiential knowledge, and in covenantal contexts, it signifies relational recognition and election. In Amos 3:2, God declares to Israel: רַק אֶתְכֶם יָדַעְתִּי מִכֹּל מִשְׁפְּחוֹת הָאֲדָמָה (raq etkhem yada'ti mi-kol mishpachot ha-adamah, "You only have I known of all the families of the earth"). This "knowing" is not intellectual awareness—God obviously knows about all nations—but covenantal election and care. Similarly, in Genesis 18:19, God says of Abraham: כִּי יְדַעְתִּיו לְמַעַן אֲשֶׁר יְצַוֶּה אֶת־בָּנָיו (ki yeda'tiv lema'an asher yetzaveh et-banav, "For I have known him, that he may command his children"). The "knowing" here is chosenness and intimate relationship.

Rashi captures this covenantal dimension: "Because He knows the way of the righteous, and it is before Him to recognize it constantly; the way of the wicked is hateful to Him, and He removes it from before Him" (לפי שהוא יודע דרך צדיקים, ולפניו הוא להכירה תמיד, ודרך רשעים שנואה בעיניו ומעבירה מלפניו). God's "knowing" is not neutral observation but active, continuous recognition—the righteous way is perpetually "before Him," held in His attention and care. Radak similarly interprets: "The meaning of *knoweth* is 'looks upon and considers with a view to doing them good'" (ופרוש יודע: מכיר ומשגיח להיטיב להם).

The Malbim, characteristically attuned to philosophical precision, argues that this "knowing" is ontologically constitutive: "This knowledge is the attachment of the intelligible to the intellect... the way of the righteous who walk in the path of perfection... is inseparable from His knowledge, and remains eternal and enduring like Him" (הידיעה הזאת היא התדבקות המושכל במשכיל... דרך הצדיקים שדורכים על מהלך השלימות... הוא בלתי נפרד מידיעתו, ונשאר נצחי קיים כמוהו). In this bold theological claim, God's knowing does not merely *observe* the righteous way but *grounds* it ontologically. That which God knows *exists*; that which He does not know lacks ultimate reality.

The term דֶּרֶךְ (derekh, "way") forms an inclusio with verse 1, where we first encountered בְּדֶרֶךְ חַטָּאִים (be-derekh chatta'im, "in the way of sinners"). Now, in the psalm's climax, דֶּרֶךְ appears twice in rapid succession: דֶּרֶךְ צַדִּיקִים ("the way of the righteous") and דֶּרֶךְ רְשָׁעִים ("the way of the wicked"). This ring composition frames the entire psalm as a meditation on two divergent paths through life. The "two ways" theology is deeply rooted in Deuteronomic thought, most famously articulated in Deuteronomy 30:15-20: רְאֵה נָתַתִּי לְפָנֶיךָ הַיּוֹם אֶת־הַחַיִּים וְאֶת־הַטּוֹב, וְאֶת־הַמָּוֶת וְאֶת־הָרָע ("See, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil"). The psalmist reconfigures this tradition: the choice between ways is less about discrete moral decisions than about fundamental orientation—anchored, fruitful engagement with divine teaching versus ethical drift.

The second colon shifts from divine knowing to impersonal dissolution: וְדֶרֶךְ רְשָׁעִים תֹּאבֵֽד (ve-derekh resha'im to'ved, "but the way of the wicked will perish"). The verb תֹּאבֵד (to'ved) is intransitive and passive—the wicked way does not require active divine destruction; it simply "perishes" or "ceases to be." BDB notes that אבד ('abad) can mean "to perish, vanish, go astray, be destroyed." The concordance search reveals that the root appears 185 times in Scripture, most frequently describing the loss or destruction of people, possessions, or hopes. Deuteronomy 8:20 warns: כַּגּוֹיִם אֲשֶׁר יהוה מַאֲבִיד מִפְּנֵיכֶם, כֵּן תֹּאבֵדוּן ("Like the nations that the Lord causes to perish before you, so shall you perish").

The grammatical asymmetry between the two cola is crucial. The righteous way is the *object* of an *active* verb with a *divine subject*: יוֹדֵעַ יהוה ("the Lord knows"). The wicked way is the *subject* of an *intransitive* verb with *no agent*: תֹּאבֵד ("it perishes"). This grammatical structure encodes a theological claim: the righteous are sustained by divine knowledge—God's active, ongoing recognition gives their way substance and permanence. The wicked, by contrast, have no such grounding; their way has no stability, no one to "know" it, and so it collapses into non-being. This is not retributive destruction but ontological evaporation.

The Meiri offers an ethical gloss that softens the ontological edge: "For the righteous will achieve and know of the honor of his Creator what is possible for him, and then the matter will be reversed—that God knows his way and supervises him with the precision of His providence that follows after his intellect and good conduct; and the way of the wicked and sinners will perish" (כי יודע ה׳ דרך צדיקים כלומר שהצדיק ישיג וידע מכבוד בוראו מה שאיפשר לו ואז יתהפך הדבר להיות האל יודע דרכו ומשגיח בו... ודרך הרשעים והחטאים תאבד). In his reading, God's "knowing" is responsive—the righteous first seek to know God, and this seeking prompts divine recognition in return.

Ibn Ezra offers a grammatical observation: the psalm concludes with a final פ (peh), the letter that often marks the end of a poetic unit or section in the Masoretic Text. This scribal tradition visually reinforces the psalm's closure, the פ functioning as a scribal "seal" that says: here ends the meditation on the two ways.

Liturgically, this verse's significance is profound. The entire psalm, including this climactic verse, is recited on Yom Kippur eve, where it serves as an opening meditation on righteous conduct. To recite this verse on the Day of Atonement is to affirm that standing before the heavenly court is not ultimately about the sum of one's deeds but about whether one walks a "way" that God "knows"—whether one's life is grounded in the divine reality or adrift in ontological weightlessness. The verse's assurance—that the righteous way is "known" by God—becomes a source of hope for the penitent community seeking mercy.

The psalm's final word, תֹּאבֵֽד (to'ved, "will perish"), stands in stark contrast to its opening word, אַשְׁרֵי (ashrei, "happy" or "blessed"). The entire psalm is bracketed between blessing and dissolution, between flourishing and perishing. Yet the final note is not the perishing of the wicked but the *knowing* of the righteous. Syntactically, כִּֽי־יוֹדֵעַ יהוה דֶּרֶךְ צַדִּיקִים is the main clause; וְדֶרֶךְ רְשָׁעִים תֹּאבֵֽד is subordinate or coordinate. The emphasis falls on divine knowing, not on wickedness. The psalm begins with the happiness of the righteous and ends with the security of divine recognition—a structure that suggests the psalm's ultimate concern is not moralism but ontology, not mere behavior but the very ground of being.
