Psalm 17 begins with a legal cry and ends with a vision. It opens:

> שִׁמְעָ֤ה יְהוָ֨ה ׀ צֶ֗דֶק;  
> הַקְשִׁ֥יבָה רִנָּתִ֗י;  
> הַאֲזִ֥ינָה תְּפִלָּתִ֑י, בְּ֝לֹ֗א שִׂפְתֵ֥י מִרְמָֽה׃  
> “Hear, O LORD, righteousness;  
> attend to my cry;  
> give ear to my prayer, from lips without deceit.”

Three near-synonyms—“hear” (שִׁמְעָה), “pay attention” (הַקְשִׁיבָה), “give ear” (הַאֲזִינָה)—pile up in what literary critics call *anaphora*, the deliberate repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of successive lines. The grammar lets צֶדֶק (“righteousness” or “justice”) hover between “hear what is right” and “hear my righteous cause.” From the first breath, the speaker stakes two claims: the justice of his case, and the honesty of his speech (“from lips without deceit”).

The psalm closes on a very different tone:

> אֲנִ֗י בְּ֭צֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶ֣ה פָנֶ֑יךָ;  
> אֶשְׂבְּעָ֥ה בְ֝הָקִ֗יץ תְּמוּנָתֶֽךָ׃  
> “As for me, in righteousness I shall behold Your face;  
> I will be satisfied, when I awake, with Your form.”

The same word, צֶדֶק, frames the psalm like bookends—what scholars call an *inclusio*: a repeated term at beginning and end that marks and interprets the whole. Here, righteousness begins as a plea (“hear righteousness”) and ends as the condition for beholding God’s face. The line between ethics and mysticism dissolves: the reward of a righteous life is not simply rescue but vision.

Between these poles the poem moves through carefully staged phases. Verses 1–2 are the opening petition: God is addressed as judge, and the psalmist asks that “my judgment come forth from before You” (מִלְּפָנֶיךָ מִשְׁפָּטִי יֵצֵא, v. 2). This legal language—“judgment,” “before Your face,” “Your eyes shall behold what is right”—places us in a courtroom more than a battlefield.

Verses 3–5 develop what we might call the deposition: a protestation of innocence, but strikingly framed from God’s side rather than the psalmist’s. Three perfect verbs, describing completed actions, pile up:

> בָּחַנְתָּ לִבִּי; פָּקַדְתָּ לַּיְלָה; צְרַפְתַּנִי בַל־תִּמְצָא׃  
> “You have examined my heart; You have visited [me] by night; You have refined me—You have found nothing.”

בָּחַן is “to test”; צָרַף is the word used for smelting metal—“You have smelted me.” In between stands the unusual פָּקַדְתָּ לַּיְלָה, “You have visited [me] at night.” Night is the time when, as Job says, “You visit him every morning; every moment You test him” (Job 7:18), but here the specification “night” invites further thought. Some have seen in it a hint of temple *incubation*—a practice known from the ancient Near East in which a sufferer sleeps in a sanctuary hoping for a dream-vision or oracle. That possibility is attractive, especially given the psalm’s closing “awakening” (בְהָקִיץ, v. 15). But the text itself does not insist on an overnight ritual. Night is also the time of solitude, when thoughts surface; to say that God “visits” at night is to say that even in the most interior hours one’s conscience has been smelted and found clean.

The Torah Temimah, a modern anthology of rabbinic readings, preserves a striking midrash on this verse. David had once prayed in another psalm, “Test me, O LORD, and try me; refine my heart and my mind” (בְּחָנֵנִי… וְנַסֵּנִי; צָרְפָה כִלְיוֹתַי וְלִבִּי, Psalm 26:2). Later he regrets his boldness: “He said: ‘If only that test had fallen into the mouth of someone who hates me, and I had not said such a thing.’” The gloss imagines David reading his own words with a shudder, aware that to invite God’s testing is to invite suffering. Psalm 17’s perfect verbs—“You *have* tested, You *have* refined”—become, in this light, the sober outcome of an earlier, perhaps rash, invitation.

The psalm then turns from inner probity to outer conduct. Verse 4 is notoriously difficult to parse: “As for human deeds, by the word of Your lips, I—I have kept … the paths of the violent” (לִפְעֻלּוֹת אָדָם בִּדְבַר שְׂפָתֶיךָ, אֲנִי שָׁמַרְתִּי אׇרְחוֹת פָּרִיץ). Does “kept the paths of the violent” mean “kept to them” or “kept away from them”? The verb שמר can bear either sense: guarding something by following it, or guarding oneself against it. Context is decisive. The psalmist has just claimed that nothing blameworthy was found; verse 5 asks God to steady his steps in God’s own paths. Most traditional and modern commentators, therefore, understand verse 4 as “I have guarded myself from the paths of the violent,” supplying the negation that the Hebrew leaves implicit. The line’s very awkwardness—the lack of a clear preposition—lets the poet set side by side the “deeds of human beings” and “the word of Your lips,” stressing that only the latter can keep one from sliding into the former.

Verses 6–9 move into direct petition. The psalmist now speaks in the first person singular emphatically—“*I* call on You; for You *will* answer me, O God” (אֲנִי־קְרָאתִיךָ כִּי־תַעֲנֵנִי אֵל, v. 6). “Incline Your ear,” he asks, returning to the auditory metaphors of verse 1. Then comes the psalm’s most tender pair of images:

> שׇׁמְרֵנִי כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת־עָיִן;  
> בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנִי׃  
> “Guard me like the pupil, the daughter of the eye;  
> hide me in the shadow of Your wings” (v. 8).

The phrase אִישׁוֹן בַּת־עָיִן literally means “the little man, daughter of the eye”—the dark pupil in which one can see a tiny reflection of oneself. Elsewhere it denotes Israel as God’s most jealously guarded point of vulnerability: “He guarded him as the pupil of His eye” (כְּאִישׁוֹן עֵינוֹ, Deut 32:10); “Whoever touches you touches the pupil of My eye” (זְכוּר בָּבַת עֵינוֹ in Zech 2:12 [Eng. 2:8]). The second image, “shadow of Your wings” (בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ), recurs throughout the Psalms (36:8, 57:2, 61:5, 63:8, 91:4), sometimes evoking a mother bird sheltering her young, sometimes the wings of the cherubim over the ark (Exod 25:20). Rabbinic commentators like Radak explicitly hear temple imagery: the worshiper is hidden under the carved wings that overshadow the divine throne.

From verse 9 onward the enemies come fully into view. They are “wicked” who “despoil” (שַׁדּוּנִי) and “encircle” the psalmist “with [desire for] my life” (בְּנֶפֶשׁ יַקִּיפוּ עָלַי, v. 9). Their interior condition is summed up: “Their fat they have closed” (חֶלְבָּמוֹ סָגְרוּ, v. 10)—a terse idiom for the spiritual dullness that can accompany prosperity. Psalm 73 uses the same language of the sleek wicked: “Their eyes bulge from fatness” (יָצָא מֵחֵלֶב עֵינֵמוֹ, Ps 73:7), making visible the link between outward luxury and inward insensitivity. Their mouths “speak with arrogance” (פִּימוֹ דִּבְּרוּ בְגֵאוּת), and their eyes prowl over the land hunting for victims (v. 11).

Suddenly, the many enemies coalesce into one figure:

> דִּמְיֹנוֹ כְּאַרְיֵה יִכְסוֹף לִטְרֹף;  
> וְכִכְפִיר יֹשֵׁב בְּמִסְתָּרִים׃  
> “His likeness is as a lion longing to tear,  
> like a young lion lurking in hiding” (v. 12).

The verb יִכְסוֹף, from the root “to long for” or “yearn” (as in “you greatly longed for your father’s house,” נִכְסֹף נִכְסַפְתָּ, Gen 31:30), makes the predator’s desire almost erotic: this is hunger with passion. The figurative-language database shows that across the Bible, lions regularly stand for predatory enemies (Ps 7:3, “Lest he tear my soul like a lion”; Isa 31:4, where God Himself is “as a lion … growling over its prey”). Psalm 17’s twist is psychological: the enemy is not only strong but ravenous.

Verses 13–14 are a cascade of imperatives: “Arise, YHWH; confront him; bring him down; deliver my soul from the wicked—Your sword; from mortals, by Your hand, YHWH; from mortals of the world, whose portion is in [this] life” (vv. 13–14). Calling the wicked “Your sword” and “Your hand” hints at a theology familiar from the prophets: foreign powers like Assyria are rods of God’s anger (Isa 10:5). The psalmist asks, in effect, to be saved even from God’s own instruments when they overreach.

Then comes the interpretive knot of verse 14. The Hebrew runs:

> מִמְתִים יָדְךָ יְהוָה, מִמְתִים מֵחֶלֶד, חֶלְקָם בַּחַיִּים;  
> וּצְפוּנְךָ תְּמַלֵּא בִטְנָם; יִשְׂבְּעוּ בָנִים; וְהִנִּיחוּ יִתְרָם לְעוֹלְלֵיהֶם׃  

Is this still talking about the wicked—“mortals of the world, whose portion is in this life, whose belly You fill with Your treasure; they are sated with children, and leave the rest to their little ones”? Or has the subject shifted back to God’s “treasured ones,” the righteous whose bellies and children God blesses?

Most medieval commentators, led by Radak and Malbim, read it as the wicked’s prosperity. The rare noun חֶלֶד appears in Psalm 39:6, “Surely every human stands as a mere breath; surely in shadow he goes about; surely he heaps up wealth and does not know who will gather it … all human חֶלֶד is but a breath” (אַךְ בְּצֶלֶם יִתְהַלֵּךְ אִישׁ… אַךְ־כָּל־הֶבֶל כָּל־אָדָם נִצָּב; וּחַלְדִּי כְּאַיִן נֶגְדֶּךָ). It points to transience. These “men of חֶלֶד” are those whose *only* horizon is the present world. They have what Ecclesiastes ironically calls “their portion in life”: “For that is your portion in life and in your toil under the sun” (כִּי הוּא חֶלְקְךָ בַּחַיִּים, Eccl 9:9).

On this view, the psalmist sketches, almost enviously, the fullness of their lot: they have full bellies, children satisfied, and enough to leave to grandchildren. The vocabulary of “satisfaction” (שָׂבַע)—“they are sated with children” (יִשְׂבְּעוּ בָנִים)—is the hinge. It reappears, inverted, in verse 15: “I will be satisfied (אֶשְׂבְּעָה)… with Your form.” The psalm thus aligns with the wisdom struggle in Job 21 and Psalm 73: why do the wicked prosper? But instead of offering a neat theodicy, it shifts the terms of the debate. If there is a good of an entirely different order—beholding God’s face—then the comparison with full stomachs and secure estates becomes almost absurd.

Finally, verse 15 makes its daring claim:

> אֲנִי בְּצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ;  
> אֶשְׂבְּעָה בְהָקִיץ תְּמוּנָתֶךָ׃  

The verb אֶחֱזֶה (from חָזָה) is the verb of prophetic vision, not of everyday seeing; Isaiah says, “Your eyes shall behold the king in his beauty” (תֶּחֱזֶינָה עֵינֶיךָ, Isa 33:17). The object is even more startling: “Your face” (פָנֶיךָ) and “Your form” (תְּמוּנָתֶךָ). Deuteronomy insists that at Sinai, “You heard the sound of words, but saw no form (תְּמוּנָה)” (Deut 4:12); Moses alone is singled out: “The form of YHWH he beholds” (וּתְמֻנַת יְהוָה יַבִּיט, Num 12:8). Our psalmist dares to speak in Mosaic terms.

How can this be reconciled with “No human shall see Me and live” (Exod 33:20)? Traditional Jewish interpreters tend to “spiritualize” the vision. Ibn Ezra glosses it as the intellect’s contemplation of God’s works: perception by the mind’s eye, not by the retina. Radak interprets “when I awake” as the resurrection of the dead: only then will the righteous behold God’s “face.” Malbim, a 19th‑century commentator with philosophical leanings, suggests that God’s “form” is present already in the human soul as the divine image; to be “satisfied” with that form is for the soul, at last unencumbered by the body, to rest in its source. 

At the same time, the psalm’s own language insists on seeing and satisfaction rather than on abstraction. The Torah Temimah cites a Talmudic teaching: “Whoever gives a coin to a poor person merits to receive the Presence of the Shekhinah,” and then quotes our verse: “אֲנִי בְּצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ—In righteousness I shall behold Your face” (Bava Batra 10a). The rabbinic move is characteristically concrete: the path to God’s face runs through mundane acts of צדקה, charity.

In the canon of Psalms, Psalm 17 stands in a cluster of prayers where God alone is “portion” and “refuge.” Psalm 16 exults, “YHWH is my allotted share and cup” (יְהוָה מְנָת חֶלְקִי וְכֹוסִי, 16:5) and ends, “In Your presence is fullness of joy; in Your right hand, pleasures forever” (16:11). Psalm 73, after envying the wicked, pivots in the sanctuary to cry, “Whom have I in heaven but You? And having You, I desire nothing on earth” (מִי־לִי בַשָּׁמָיִם… וְעִמְּךָ לֹא־חָפַצְתִּי בָאָרֶץ, 73:25). Psalm 142, a cousin in vocabulary, says, “You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living” (חֶלְקִי בְּאֶרֶץ הַחַיִּים, 142:6). Psalm 17 pushes this line of thought to an edge: not only is God one’s portion; God’s *face* is one’s food.

The psalm’s enduring power lies in this double movement. It is thoroughly this-worldly: its speaker is encircled, slandered, in real physical danger. It uses the earthy metaphors of eyes and fat, steps and wings, lions and swords. And yet it ends with a claim that cannot be limited to the present crisis: the satisfaction that finally matters is not a full belly or a long line of heirs, but “when I awake” and find myself facing God.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

#### Full psalm

In the Edot HaMizrach (Eastern) tradition, Psalm 17 is recited in full on Yom Kippur morning as part of an expanded *Pesukei de‑Zimra* (the preliminary psalms and praises). In that setting, David’s personal “prayer of legal vindication” becomes a communal plea for mercy and protection on the Day of Judgment. The psalm is also used, again in full, in some communities in the lengthy *Selichot* service on the eve of Yom Kippur, where its opening “Hear, O LORD, righteousness” is read as the collective voice of Israel.

#### Key verses

*Verse 1*—שִׁמְעָ֤ה יְהוָ֨ה ׀ צֶ֗דֶק הַקְשִׁ֥יבָה רִנָּתִ֗י הַאֲזִ֥ינָה תְּפִלָּתִ֑י בְּ֝לֹ֗א שִׂפְתֵ֥י מִרְמָֽה׃  
“Hear, O LORD, righteousness; attend to my cry; give ear to my prayer from lips without deceit.”

This line is woven into *Selichot* in both Ashkenazi and Sephardi rites. A Sephardi *Selichah* for the days before Rosh Hashanah begins: “שְׁמַע יְהוָה קוֹלֵנוּ… שִׁמְעָה יְהוָה צֶדֶק הַקְשִׁיבָה רִנָּתֵנוּ הַאֲזִינָה תְּפִלָּתֵנוּ—Hear, O LORD, our voice… Hear, O LORD, righteousness; attend to our cry; give ear to our prayer.” The verse’s triple verb becomes a template for the worshiper’s own insistent pleading.

*Verse 15*—אֲנִ֗י בְּ֭צֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶ֣ה פָנֶ֑יךָ אֶשְׂבְּעָ֥ה בְ֝הָקִ֗יץ תְּמוּנָתֶֽךָ׃  
“As for me, in righteousness I shall behold Your face; I will be satisfied, when I awake, with Your form.”

In the Sefardic daily *Birkat Kohanim* (Priestly Blessing), recited during the chazzan’s repetition of the *Amidah*, the congregation responds to “יַשֵּׂא יְהוָה פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ—May the LORD lift up His face upon you” with verses expressing longing for that face: “אַל־תַּסְתֵּר פָּנֶיךָ מִמֶּנִּי… אֲנִי בְּצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ אֶשְׂבְּעָה בְהָקִיץ תְּמוּנָתֶךָ—Do not hide Your face from me… As for me, in righteousness I shall behold Your face; I will be satisfied when I awake with Your form.” The priestly wish (“May His face shine on you”) becomes a reciprocal aspiration: we wish not only to be shone upon, but to behold.

#### Phrases

*“Guard me like the apple of the eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings”*—שׇׁמְרֵנִי כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת־עָיִן; בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנִי׃ (v. 8).

These lines have a rich liturgical afterlife. In the Sefardic *Birkat Kohanim*, the congregation responds to “וְיִשְׁמְרֶךָ—May He guard you” with: “שָׁמְרֵנִי אֵל כִּי חָסִיתִי בָךְ; שָׁמְרֵנִי כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת עָיִן; בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנִי—Guard me, O God, for I have taken refuge in You; guard me like the pupil of the eye; in the shadow of Your wings hide me.” The biblical metaphors become the congregation’s own gloss on the priestly blessing. Sefardi table songs for Friday night describe Israel as “עַם נְצוּר כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת עַיִן נִשְׁמָר—a people guarded like the pupil of the eye,” casting Shabbat itself as dwelling under those wings.

Other fragments are used more locally. Verse 7 (“הַפְלֵה חֲסָדֶיךָ מוֹשִׁיעַ חוֹסִים…”) appears in the *Yehi Ratzon* prayers during the Korban ha‑Nesi’im readings in Nisan, and the plea “פַּלְּטָה נַפְשִׁי מֵרָשָׁע חַרְבֶּךָ—Deliver my life from the wicked, Your sword” (v. 13) is adapted in memorial prayers for martyrs. Liturgy thus reads Psalm 17 both as personal cry and as a template for Israel’s recurring need for refuge and vindication.
