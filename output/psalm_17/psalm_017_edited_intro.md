Psalm 17 opens not with contrition but with a summons:  

> תְּפִלָּה לְדָוִד; שִׁמְעָה יְהוָה צֶדֶק,  
> הַקְשִׁיבָה רִנָּתִי; הַאֲזִינָה תְּפִלָּתִי, בְּלֹא שִׂפְתֵי מִרְמָה.  

“A prayer of David. Hear, O YHWH, *justice*; give heed to my cry; listen to my prayer—from lips without deceit.”  

The first word addressed to God is not “mercy” but *צֶדֶק* (*tzedeq*), justice. The psalmist does not cast himself as a sinner begging for pardon (as in Psalm 51) but as a defendant demanding that his just case be heard. That opening line already sketches the drama of the psalm: human courts have failed, enemies have seized the narrative; the only hope is to appeal to the Judge whose eyes cannot be bribed.

The three verbs—“hear,” “give heed,” “listen”—are a classic example of what scholars call *parallelism*, the basic poetic device in biblical verse in which the second and third phrases echo and sharpen the first. Here the triple imperative piles insistence upon insistence: *שִׁמְעָה … הַקְשִׁיבָה … הַאֲזִינָה*. Read aloud, they hammer like a fist on a locked door.

#### The legal frame

Verse 2 makes the legal theater explicit:

> מִלְּפָנֶיךָ מִשְׁפָּטִי יֵצֵא;  
> עֵינֶיךָ תֶּחֱזֶינָה מֵישָׁרִים.  

“From before You let my judgment come forth; may Your eyes behold what is upright.”

*מִשְׁפָּטִי* (“my judgment”) is the verdict the psalmist wants publicly issued from God’s *presence* (literally “face,” *פָּנִים*). The verb “go forth” is courtroom language: a decision is rendered and emerges from the judge’s chambers into the world. The second line turns from the ear to the eye. God’s “eyes” are asked to see *מֵישָׁרִים*—straightness, equity. Human observers see a fugitive; God, the psalm insists, will see a straight path.

That path is defended in verses 3–5 with a remarkable triple testing:

> בָּחַנְתָּ לִבִּי, פָּקַדְתָּ לַּיְלָה, צְרַפְתַּנִי בַל־תִּמְצָא;  
> זַמֹּתִי בַּל־יַעֲבֹר־פִּי.  

“You have probed my heart, You have visited me by night, You have refined me—you will find nothing; I have resolved that my mouth will not transgress.”

Each verb deepens the inspection. *בָּחַן* is to assay metal, to test its quality; *פָּקַד* is to “visit,” in the sense of inspect or take account; *צָרַף* is to refine silver over fire. Night is when thoughts surface. Under that intense, nocturnal scrutiny, the poet claims, no scheme (*זִמָּה*) was found, no premeditated malice that would cross his lips. Traditional Jewish readers were not blind to the audacity here. Rashi, who reads the psalm against the backdrop of David and Bathsheba, glosses “You visited me by night” as the moment of that sin and still hears David saying: once judged and chastened, my heart and speech are aligned.

Verse 4, syntactically gnarled, anchors this innocence in obedience:

> לִפְעֻלּוֹת אָדָם, בִּדְבַר שְׂפָתֶיךָ;  
> אֲנִי שָׁמַרְתִּי אׇרְחוֹת פָּרִיץ.  

“As for human deeds—by the word of Your lips—I have kept away from the paths of the violent.”

The “word of Your lips” is Torah, the revealed will. *אׇרְחוֹת פָּרִיץ*—“paths of the violent, the lawless one”—are the shortcuts of those who seize by force what they cannot obtain by right. Many medievals hear behind this line the stories in 1 Samuel where David refuses to murder Saul even when he can. He “kept” himself from that violent path precisely because of “the word of [God’s] lips.”

Verse 5 continues the travel metaphor:

> תָּמֹךְ אֲשֻׁרַי בְּמַעְגְּלוֹתֶיךָ;  
> בַּל־נָמוֹטּוּ פְּעָמָי.  

“Hold firm my steps in Your tracks; let my feet not slip.”

*מַעְגָּל* is not just a “path” but a track worn into the ground—a wagon-rut produced by repeated passage. The poet asks that his steps cling to those divine grooves. Malbim, with psychological acuity, notes that sometimes righteousness itself requires leaving the “straight” road—showing courage against the wicked, even harshness—and that it is precisely in those morally complex detours that one needs God to keep one from sliding into cruelty.

The psalm thus opens as a kind of spiritual affidavit: my lips are clean, my thoughts have been smelted, my feet have not followed the brigand’s trail. Only then does the tone become unapologetically petitionary.

#### The center: hesed and hiding

Verses 6–9 turn from defense to plea, and the rhetoric softens from forensic to intimate:

> הַפְלֵה חֲסָדֶיךָ מוֹשִׁיעַ חוֹסִים;  
> מִמִּתְקוֹמְמִים בִּימִינֶךָ.  

“Make wondrous Your steadfast love, O savior of those who seek refuge, from those who rise up [against them] by Your right hand.”

The verb *הַפְלֵה* (“make wondrous, set apart”) comes from a root meaning “to distinguish” or “do something extraordinary.” In Exodus 8:18 God says, “וְהִפְלֵיתִי בַּיּוֹם הַהוּא אֶת־אֶרֶץ גֹּשֶׁן”—“I will set apart on that day the land of Goshen” from Egypt’s plagues. Here the psalmist asks for that same kind of visible separation between himself and his enemies, a public display of *חֶסֶד*—covenant loyalty—toward “those who take refuge” in God.

Immediately comes the most tender pair of images in the psalm:

> שָׁמְרֵנִי כְאִישׁוֹן בַּת־עָיִן;  
> בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנִי.  

“Guard me like the apple of the eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings.”

*אִישׁוֹן בַּת־עָיִן* is literally the “little man” in the “daughter of the eye”—the tiny human reflection one sees in another’s pupil. Deuteronomy 32:10 uses the same phrase for God’s care of Israel in the wilderness: “יִצְּרֶנְהוּ כְּאִישׁוֹן עֵינוֹ” (“He guarded him like the apple of His eye”). To harm that “little man” is to strike the organ of sight itself. Zechariah 2:8 intensifies the image: “הַנֹּגֵעַ בָּכֶם נֹגֵעַ בְּבָבַת עֵינוֹ”—“whoever touches you touches the apple of His eye.” Psalm 17 joins that tradition: the speaker asks to be the point where God’s gaze focuses and therefore the point God instinctively shields.

The “shadow of Your wings” belongs to a small constellation of psalms. Psalm 36:8 says, “וּבְנֵי אָדָם בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ יֶחֱסָיוּן”—“Human beings take refuge in the shadow of Your wings”; Psalm 57:2: “בְּצֵל־כְּנָפֶיךָ אֶחְסֶה עַד יַעֲבֹר הַוּוֹת”—“In the shadow of Your wings I take refuge, until calamities pass.” On the surface it is the picture of a bird sheltering its young. Yet in Israel’s temple, the Ark of the Covenant was overshadowed by cherubim whose wings met above it (Exodus 25:20). To be hidden under God’s wings is also to be hidden under that canopy in the sanctuary. The metaphor is double: maternal and architectural, intimate and cultic.

What drives him there are “the wicked who despoil me … my enemies who encircle me” (v. 9). The verb *יַקִּיפוּ* (“encircle”) and the phrase “hem in our steps” (v. 11) belong to the same military-hunting lexicon as other laments: “הֽוּא־יוֹצִיא מֵרֶשֶׁת רַגְלָי” (“He will free my feet from the net,” Ps 25:15). Psalm 31 combines both net and shelter: “תּוֹצִיאֵנִי מֵרֶשֶׁת זוּ טָמְנוּ לִי … תַסְתִּירֵם בְּסֵתֶר פָּנֶיךָ” (“You free me from the net they hid for me … You hide them in the shelter of Your face,” Ps 31:5,21). Psalm 17 stands in that cluster: enemies tightening the circle, God offering a hidden place.

#### The enemies and the “men of the world”

Verses 10–12 anatomize the pursuers:

> חֶלְבָּמוֹ סָגְרוּ; פִּימוֹ דִּבְּרוּ בְגֵאוּת.  

“They have closed their fat; their mouth speaks with arrogance.”

In biblical physiology, *חֵלֶב* is the rich fat around the organs, especially the heart. Job 15:27 says of the wicked man, “כִּי־כִסָּה פָנָיו בְּחֶלְבּוֹ”—“he covered his face with his fat.” To “close the fat” is to seal off the inner seat of feeling. The psalm does not say they lack information; it says they have shut down compassion. That interior callousness pairs with external swagger: “their mouth speaks *בְּגֵאוּת*”—in pride. The internal organ is sealed; the public voice is loud.

By verse 12, the many foes are distilled into one archetypal predator:

> דִּמְיֹנוֹ כְאַרְיֵה יִכְסֹף לִטְרֹף, וְכִכְפִיר יֹשֵׁב בְּמִסְתָּרִים.  

“His likeness is like a lion craving to tear, and like a young lion crouching in hiding places.”

The verb *כָּסַף* usually describes yearning (“נִכְסֹף נִכְסַפְתָּ,” “you greatly longed,” Gen 31:30); here the lion “longs” to rend. The young lion “sits in ambush” in the *מִסְתָּרִים*—the very root (*סתר*) used for God’s “hiding” of the psalmist. Both God and the enemy conceal, but with opposite intent: one to shelter, one to pounce.

The petition of verses 13–14 then casts God as warrior:

> קוּמָה יְהוָה, קַדְּמָה פָנָיו הַכְרִיעֵהוּ;  
> פַּלְּטָה נַפְשִׁי מֵרָשָׁע חַרְבֶּךָ.  

“Arise, YHWH, confront him, bring him down; rescue my life from the wicked—Your sword.”

“Arise” is liturgical battle cry (cf. Num 10:35). “Confront his face” pictures God intercepting the attacker head‑on. The startling phrase “the wicked, *Your sword*” echoes Isaiah’s “Assyria, the rod of My anger” (Isa 10:5): foreign power is God’s instrument of punishment, even as God remains free to break that instrument.

Then comes one of the densest verses in the psalm:

> מִמְתִים יָדְךָ יְהוָה, מִמְתִים מֵחֶלֶד חֶלְקָם בַּחַיִּים;  
> וּצְפוּנְךָ תְּמַלֵּא בִטְנָם, יִשְׂבְּעוּ בָנִים,  
> וְהִנִּיחוּ יִתְרָם לְעוֹלְלֵיהֶם.  

“From mortals, by Your hand, O YHWH; from mortals of the world, whose portion is in [this] life—  
with Your hidden treasure You fill their belly; they are sated with children, and leave their surplus to their babes.”

*חֶלֶד* names not “world” in the spatial sense but the span of life—the transient era in which one is alive. Psalm 49 addresses “כָּל יֹשְׁבֵי חָלֶד,” “all who dwell in this fleeting world” (v. 2). Here “mortals of *cheled*” are those whose horizon is bounded by mortality. Their “portion” (*חֵלֶק*) is strictly *בַּחַיִּים*—within this life. God, ironically, grants them what they want: full stomachs, full quivers, estates large enough to leave an *excess* (*יֶתֶר*) to grandchildren. Radak is blunt: they “have no hope for the world to come.” The problem is not that they enjoy good things, but that they mistake those goods for the whole.

The Sages occasionally read this verse more darkly and more concretely. Torah Temimah cites a Talmudic teaching that links “וּצְפוּנְךָ תְּמַלֵּא בִטְנָם” to the curious claim that placing one’s bed north-south leads to male offspring: God’s “hidden things” filling the belly in this reading is literally the womb’s fruit. Other midrashim tie “from men, Your hand” to God’s granting martyrs like Rabbi Akiva the chance to “die by Your hand,” fulfilling “with all your soul” even at the cost of life (Berakhot 61b).

#### “As for me” and the awakening

Against those “men of *cheled*” the final verse sets a starkly different appetite:

> אֲנִי בְצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ;  
> אֶשְׂבְּעָה בְהָקִיץ תְּמוּנָתֶךָ.  

“As for me, in righteousness I shall behold Your face; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Your likeness.”

The pronoun *אֲנִי*—“I”—is adversative: *they* have their portion in this life; *I*, by contrast, want this. The frame of *צֶדֶק* closes: he began with “Hear, O YHWH, justice” and ends “in righteousness I shall behold Your face.” The verb *אֶחֱזֶה* belongs to the vocabulary of vision used for prophets; Numbers 24:4 calls Balaam “חֹזֶה מַחֲזֵה שַׁדַּי,” “the seer of the vision of Shaddai.” Here the object is God’s *פָּנִים*—face or presence. Elsewhere that face is deadly to mortals (“no one shall see Me and live,” Exod 33:20), yet Moses is allowed to behold God’s *תְּמוּנָה*—form (Num 12:8). Psalm 17 dares to extend that Mosaic privilege: the end of righteousness is not safety but sight.

The crucial phrase is *בְּהָקִיץ*—“when I awake.” The same verb describes waking from ordinary sleep (1 Sam 26:12) and, in prophetic and apocalyptic texts, rousing from death: “רַבִּים מִיְּשֵׁנֵי אַדְמַת־עָפָר יָקִיצוּ” (“Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake,” Dan 12:2). Given the immediate contrast with those whose portion is only “in life,” many Jewish commentators, from Radak onward, take Psalm 17 into that eschatological register: when I awake from the long sleep, I will be satisfied not with belly or descendants but with Your *temunah*.

That word *תְּמוּנָה* is itself risky. It is the very term the Decalogue uses in forbidding images: “לֹא תַעֲשֶׂה לְךָ פֶסֶל וְכָל־תְּמוּנָה” (“You shall not make for yourself a sculptured image or any form,” Exod 20:4). God’s *temunah* is precisely what must not be manufactured. Yet Numbers 12:8 says of Moses, “וּתְמֻנַת יְהוָה יַבִּיט”—“he beholds the form of YHWH.” Psalm 17 stands delicately between these: the image is not one the worshiper creates; it is the self-disclosure God grants. Maimonidean readers tried to “dematerialize” the line, reading it as intellectual apprehension of divine truth. Mystics and liturgists were more literal. In the Sefardi priestly blessing, when the Kohanim proclaim, “יָאֵר יְהוָה פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ” (“May YHWH make His face shine upon you,” Num 6:25), the congregation responds with this very verse: “אֲנִי בְצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ; אֶשְׂבְּעָה בְהָקִיץ תְּמוּנָתֶךָ.” Liturgically, the Levitical wish for God’s shining face becomes a promise of its eventual sight.

One remarkable rabbinic comment, preserved in Bava Batra 10a, goes further. Rabbi Dostai notes that when a person gives a coin to the poor, “הרי זה זוכה ומקבל פני שכינה”—he merits to “receive the face of the Presence,” and he cites our verse: “אֲנִי בְצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ.” The “righteousness” that leads to vision is not abstract virtue but concrete justice—*tzedakah*.

In the end, Psalm 17 is about what finally satisfies. The “men of the world” are stuffed with treasure, children, and legacy; the psalmist wants a different fullness. Twice the root שׂ־ב־ע (“be sated”) is used: “they are sated with sons” (v. 14), “I shall be sated with Your likeness” (v. 15). Help now, yes; protection, certainly. But the horizon of the prayer is not merely survival or vindication. It is the awakening into a gaze.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

#### Full psalm

In the Eastern (Edot HaMizrach) tradition, Psalm 17 is recited in full on Yom Kippur morning as part of an expanded *Pesukei de‑Zimra*. There it becomes a communal “prayer of the accused” on the Day of Judgment, the congregation taking David’s language—“שִׁמְעָה יְהוָה צֶדֶק … בְּלֹא שִׂפְתֵי מִרְמָה” (“Hear, O LORD, justice … from lips without deceit,” vv. 1–2)—into its own mouth. The same tradition also inserts the psalm into the lengthy biblical preface to the *Selichot* of Yom Kippur eve, again stressing the juridical atmosphere.

#### Key verses

Verse 2, “מִלְּפָנֶיךָ מִשְׁפָּטִי יֵצֵא; עֵינֶיךָ תֶּחֱזֶינָה מֵישָׁרִים” (“From before You let my judgment go forth; may Your eyes behold what is right”), is quoted in an Ashkenazic *piyyut* for Rosh Hashanah, woven into the *Kedushah* of the *Musaf* Amidah. The poet pleads: “מִלְּפָנֶיךָ מִשְׁפָּטִי יֵצֵא”—“let my verdict come forth from You,” framing the day as a cosmic court session.

Verse 13, “פַּלְּטָה נַפְשִׁי מֵרָשָׁע חַרְבֶּךָ” (“Rescue my life from the wicked—Your sword”), appears in a special *El Maleh Rachamim* for the martyrs of the 1648–49 massacres, recited on the fast of 20 Sivan. There it becomes a plea for God to avenge “the blood of Your servants,” re‑reading the individual peril of Psalm 17 against Jewish historical catastrophe.

Verse 15, “אֲנִי בְצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ; אֶשְׂבְּעָה בְהָקִיץ תְּמוּנָתֶךָ,” is prominent in Sefardi *Birkat Kohanim*. When the priests recite “יָאֵר יְהוָה פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ” (“May YHWH cause His face to shine upon you”), the congregation responds with our verse, explicitly linking the priestly blessing’s shining face with the eschatological vision: “As for me, in righteousness I shall behold Your face; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Your likeness.”

#### Phrases

The double image of verse 8—“שָׁמְרֵנִי כְאִישׁוֹן בַּת־עָיִן; בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנִי” (“Guard me like the apple of the eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings”)—is widely used. In Sefardi weekday and festival *Birkat Kohanim*, when the priest pronounces “וְיִשְׁמְרֶךָ” (“and may He guard you,” Num 6:24), the congregation replies: “שָׁמְרֵנוּ כְאִישׁוֹן בַּת־עָיִן; וּבְצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנוּ”—“Guard us like the apple of the eye; and in the shadow of Your wings hide us.” In the *Seudah Revi‘it* (the fourth meal after Shabbat) in Mizrachi communities, worshipers pray: “בְּכֹחַ סְגֻלָּתָהּ שָׁמְרֵנוּ כְאִישׁוֹן בַּת עָיִן, וּבְצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנוּ”—using Shabbat’s lingering sanctity as the warrant for continued protection.

The opening cry “שִׁמְעָה יְהוָה צֶדֶק הַקְשִׁיבָה רִנָּתִי” (“Hear, O LORD, justice; give heed to my cry,” v. 1) is quoted in Sefardi *Selichot* before Rosh Hashanah: “שְׁמַע יְהוָה קוֹלֵנוּ … שִׁמְעָה יְהוָה צֶדֶק הַקְשִׁיבָה רִנָּתֵנוּ”—“Hear, O LORD, our voice … Hear, O LORD, justice; give heed to our song.” The liturgy thus reads the verse as a communal summons to divine justice, not just an individual’s plea.
