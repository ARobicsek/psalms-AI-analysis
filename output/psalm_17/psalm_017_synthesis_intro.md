# Introduction Essay

The opening line of Psalm 17 lands like a legal brief: "שִׁמְעָ֤ה יְהוָ֨ה ׀ צֶ֗דֶק" (*shim'ah YHWH | tzedeq*) – "Hear, O LORD, righteousness." The petitioner does not begin with "mercy" or "grace" but with *tzedeq* (צֶדֶק), the technical vocabulary of the courtroom. This is not the cry of a penitent but the appeal of the accused who knows the law is on his side. The psalm unfolds as a sustained juridical drama, a "prayer of the accused" that moves from the earthly tribunal, corrupted and hostile, to the supreme court of heaven, where the petitioner stakes his life on the divine capacity to see what human eyes cannot: true righteousness.

The macro thesis identifies this as a "temple-oriented prayer of legal vindication" that culminates in a radical claim: satisfaction lies not in material prosperity but in beholding God's face. This reading is defensible and aligns with both the psalm's internal structure and its rich reception history, but it requires refinement. The evidence suggests that Psalm 17 is not merely *about* competing visions of human flourishing – it *enacts* that competition through a forensic rhetoric so confident it borders on audacity. The petitioner invites God to "test" (*tzaraftani*, v. 3), "visit by night" (*paqadta laylah*, v. 3), and "examine" (*bachanta libbi*, v. 3) – a triple invitation to divine scrutiny that assumes the verdict will confirm innocence. This is not the language of Job, baffled by suffering; it is the language of the plaintiff who knows the contract.

The psalm's architecture is chiastic, centering on verse 7's plea: "הַפְלֵ֣ה חֲ֭סָדֶיךָ מוֹשִׁ֣יעַ חוֹסִ֑ים" (*hafleh chasadekha moshi'a chosim*) – "Make wondrous Your steadfast love, O Savior of those who take refuge." The verb *hafleh* (הַפְלֵה) is the same root used when God "set apart" (Exodus 8:22) the land of Goshen from Egypt's plagues. The psalmist asks not for routine divine favor but for a miraculous *distinction* to be drawn, a visible separation between the righteous and the wicked. Radiating from this center, the psalm moves from forensic appeal (vv. 1-2) through protestation of innocence (vv. 3-5) to petition for protection (vv. 6-9), then complaint against enemies (vv. 10-12), divine intervention (vv. 13-14), and climactic vision (v. 15). The structure itself performs the movement from the horizontal plane of human justice to the vertical axis of theophanic encounter.

The psalm's most striking metaphors cluster around the theme of divine vision and protection. Verse 8 presents two images so intimate they verge on the tactile: "שָׁמְרֵ֗נִי כְּאִישׁ֣וֹן בַּת־עָ֑יִן בְּצֵ֥ל כְּ֝נָפֶ֗יךָ תַּסְתִּירֵֽנִי" (*shamreni k'ishon bat-ayin b'tzel kenafekha tastiyreni*) – "Guard me as the apple of the eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings." The phrase *ishon bat-ayin* (אִישׁוֹן בַּת־עָיִן) is anatomically precise: *ishon* derives from *ish* (man) with the diminutive suffix, referring to the reflection one sees in another's pupil – the "little man" of the eye. To be the apple of God's eye is to occupy the focal point of divine attention, the reflexive center where any harm to the object is harm to the Observer. BDB notes that this construction appears in Deuteronomy 32:10, where God guards Israel as *ishon* in the wilderness, and in Zechariah 2:8, where touching Israel is touching God's own eye. The second image, "shadow of wings" (*tzel kenafekha*), evokes the cherubim overshadowing the ark in the Holy of Holies. This is not ornithological but architectural: the psalmist seeks asylum in the sanctuary itself, in the penumbra of the divine throne.

The enemies are portrayed with zoomorphic intensity. Verse 10 describes them as having "closed their fat" (*chelbamo sagru*, חֶלְבָּ֥מוֹ סָּגְר֑וּ), a phrase that has puzzled translators. The NJPS renders it "they are closed to pity," while others emend to "their heart" (*libbam*). Yet the MT's "fat" is deliberate: in biblical physiology, the fat around the heart (*chelev*, חֵלֶב) represented the emotional core, the seat of compassion. To "close the fat" is to render oneself impervious to pity, to cultivate a hardened interior. This metaphor of the insensate heart sets up the climactic contrast in verse 14, where the wicked are described as "men of the world, whose portion is in this life" (*mimtim mecheled chelqam bachayim*, מִֽמְתִ֬ים מֵחֶ֗לֶד חֶלְקָ֥ם בַּֽחַיִּים֮). The term *cheled* (חֶלֶד) is rare, appearing only here and in Psalm 49:2. BDB glosses it as "world" or "duration," but the lexical range suggests transience – the "fleeting world." These are the secularists whose horizon is bounded by biology and dynasty, who "fill their bellies" with wealth and whose satisfaction comes from "sons" and "inheritance" (*yisbe'u vanim v'hinichu yitram l'oleleihem*, יִשְׂבְּע֥וּ בָנִ֑ים וְהִנִּ֥יחוּ יִ֝תְרָ֗ם לְעוֹלְלֵיהֶֽם).

Against this materialist ethic stands verse 15, the psalm's theological crescendo: "אֲנִ֗י בְּ֭צֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶ֣ה פָנֶ֑יךָ אֶשְׂבְּעָ֥ה בְ֝הָקִ֗יץ תְּמוּנָתֶֽךָ" (*ani b'tzedeq echezeh fanekha esbe'ah b'hakitz temunatkha*) – "As for me, in righteousness I shall behold Your face; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Your likeness." The emphatic *ani* ("as for me") marks a decisive rupture with the values of verse 14. The verb *esbe'ah* (אֶשְׂבְּעָ֥ה, "I shall be satisfied") uses the same root (*sava'*) applied to the enemy's belly-filling in verse 14, creating a deliberate lexical opposition: their satisfaction versus mine, their *cheleq* (portion) versus my vision. The object of this satisfaction is *temunah* (תְּמוּנָה), a term fraught with theological danger. It means "form," "shape," or "likeness" – the very word used in the Decalogue's prohibition against making images (Exodus 20:4). Yet it is also Moses' privilege: "He beholds the *temunah* of the LORD" (Numbers 12:8). The psalmist claims a Mosaic intimacy, a direct visual access to God that transcends cultic mediation.

The phrase *b'hakitz* (בְ֝הָקִ֗יץ, "when I awake") has generated centuries of interpretive debate. Does it refer to waking from the incubation sleep of temple ritual, as Mowinckel suggested? Or is it, as Rashi and later Jewish tradition insisted, the eschatological waking of the resurrection? The concordance search for *b'hakitz* yields only Psalm 17:15 and Daniel 12:2 – "Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake (*yakitzu*, יָקִ֫יצוּ), some to eternal life" – creating a striking intertextual link. The contrast with the "men of the world" whose "portion is in this life" pushes the meaning beyond the temporal. The psalmist anticipates a waking that transcends the biological cycle, a vision that satisfies the deepest ontological hunger because it is God Himself.

The liturgical reception of Psalm 17 confirms this eschatological reading. In the Edot HaMizrach tradition, the psalm is recited in its entirety during the expanded Pesukei Dezimra on Yom Kippur morning, the Day of Judgment. Verse 8's plea for protection appears across multiple liturgical contexts: in the Sefardic Seder Birkat Kohanim, the congregation responds to the priestly blessing with "שָׁמְרֵנִי כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת עָיִן בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנִי" (*shamreni k'ishon bat-ayin b'tzel kenafekha tastiyreni*) – "Guard me as the apple of the eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings." The phrase "בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ" (*b'tzel kenafekha*) migrated into the Shabbat Seudah Revi'it meditation, where it frames the transition from sacred time to ordinary time: "by the power of its virtue, guard us like the apple of the eye; hide us in the shadow of Your wings." Most strikingly, verse 15 itself appears in the Sefardic Birkat Kohanim response sequence: when the Kohanim chant "יָאֵר ה' פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ" (*ya'er Adonai panav elekha*, "May the LORD make His face shine upon you"), the congregation responds, "אֲנִי בְּצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ אֶשְׂבְּעָה בְהָקִיץ תְּמוּנָתֶךָ" (*ani b'tzedeq echezeh fanekha esbe'ah b'hakitz temunatkha*). This liturgical pairing transforms the priestly blessing from a petition for present favor into an eschatological promise: the "shining face" is not merely metaphorical but anticipatory, a proleptic glimpse of the *panim* that will be seen *b'tzedeq* (in righteousness) at the end of days.

The psalm's relationship to Ancient Near Eastern juridical theology is illuminating. Akkadian prayers to Shamash, the sun god who "sees all," often appeal for judgment: "O Shamash, judge my case, decide my verdict!" (*dini din*). Yet the Hebrew text diverges sharply: the Babylonian petitioner assumes guilt is unknowable, the result of inadvertent offense or sorcery, and seeks appeasement. The author of Psalm 17, by contrast, stands on covenant, on the "word of Your lips" (*bidvar sefatekha*, בִּדְבַ֣ר שְׂפָתֶ֑יךָ, v. 4). There is no mystery about the standard. The confidence is not hubris but covenantal literacy.

What earned this psalm its canonical place is precisely this audacity: it refuses to accept that material prosperity is the measure of divine favor. It insists, against the evidence of the eye, that the wicked may "fill their bellies" but remain empty, while the righteous, though surrounded and hunted, possess a satisfaction that outlasts death itself. In a culture where children and wealth were signs of blessing, Psalm 17 performs a daring inversion: the ultimate *cheleq* (portion) is not land or dynasty but the *temunah* – the face of God. This is not quietism but a radical reordering of value, where vision becomes the currency of the kingdom.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

Psalm 17 occupies a distinctive liturgical niche, appearing most prominently in the Edot HaMizrach (Eastern communities) tradition, where it is recited in full during the expanded Pesukei Dezimra section of Yom Kippur Shacharit. This placement frames the psalm as a corporate plea for vindication on the Day of Judgment, extending its original juridical context from individual to communal innocence-claiming. More widespread is the use of specific verses and phrases across multiple liturgical moments. Verse 8's dual metaphor – "שָׁמְרֵנִי כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת עָיִן בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנִי" (*shamreni k'ishon bat-ayin b'tzel kenafekha tastiyreni*, "Guard me as the apple of the eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings") – appears prominently in Sefardic liturgy within the Seder Birkat Kohanim, recited as a congregational response during the Chazan's repetition of the Amidah. The phrase also features in the Seudah Revi'it (Fourth Meal) introduction in Mizrachi tradition, marking the Shabbat-to-weekday transition: "בְּכֹֽחַ סְגֻלָּתָהּ שָׁמְרֵֽנוּ כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת עָֽיִן, וּבְצֵל כְּנָפֶֽיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵֽנוּ" (*b'choach seggullatah shamrenu k'ishon bat-ayin, uv'tzel kenafekha tastiyrenu*, "by the power of its virtue, guard us like the apple of the eye; hide us in the shadow of Your wings"). Most theologically significant is the use of verse 15 in the Sefardic Birkat Kohanim response: when the priests bless with "יָאֵר ה' פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ" (*ya'er Adonai panav elekha*, "May the LORD make His face shine upon you"), the congregation responds, "אֲנִי בְּצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ אֶשְׂבְּעָה בְהָקִיץ תְּמוּנָתֶךָ" (*ani b'tzedeq echezeh fanekha esbe'ah b'hakitz temunatkha*, "As for me, in righteousness I shall behold Your face; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Your likeness"). This liturgical pairing transforms the priestly blessing from present petition to eschatological promise, reading the psalm's "awakening" as resurrection hope. Individual phrases also appear in penitential contexts: verse 1's "שִׁמְעָה יְהוָה צֶדֶק" (*shim'ah YHWH tzedeq*) is embedded in Ashkenazic Yom Kippur piyyutim and Sefardic Selichot for the 20th of Sivan fast, where its forensic vocabulary reinforces the juridical atmosphere of these occasions. The liturgical tradition thus reads Psalm 17 both literally (
