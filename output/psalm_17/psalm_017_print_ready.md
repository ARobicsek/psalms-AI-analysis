# Commentary on Psalm 17
---
## Introduction
Psalm 17 opens not with contrition but with a summons:  
> תְּפִלָּה לְדָוִד; שִׁמְעָה ה׳ צֶדֶק,  
> הַקְשִׁיבָה רִנָּתִי; הַאֲזִינָה תְּפִלָּתִי, בְּלֹא שִׂפְתֵי מִרְמָה.  
“A prayer of David. Hear, O YHWH, *justice*; give heed to my cry; listen to my prayer—from lips without deceit.”  
The first word addressed to God is not “mercy” but *צֶדֶק* (*tzedeq*), justice. The psalmist does not cast himself as a sinner begging for pardon (as in Psalm 51) but as a defendant demanding that his just case be heard. That opening line already sketches the drama of the psalm: human courts have failed, enemies have seized the narrative; the only hope is to appeal to the Judge whose eyes cannot be bribed.
The three verbs—“hear,” “give heed,” “listen”—are a classic example of what scholars call *parallelism*, the basic poetic device in biblical verse in which the second and third phrases echo and sharpen the first. Here the triple imperative piles insistence upon insistence: *שִׁמְעָה … הַקְשִׁיבָה … הַאֲזִינָה*. Read aloud, they hammer like a fist on a locked door.
#### The legal frame
Verse 2 makes the legal theater explicit:
> מִלְּפָנֶיךָ מִשְׁפָּטִי יֵצֵא;  
> עֵינֶיךָ תֶּחֱזֶינָה מֵישָׁרִים.  
“From before You let my judgment come forth; may Your eyes behold what is upright.”
*מִשְׁפָּטִי* (“my judgment”) is the verdict the psalmist wants publicly issued from God’s *presence* (literally “face,” *פָּנִים*). The verb “go forth” is courtroom language: a decision is rendered and emerges from the judge’s chambers into the world. The second line turns from the ear to the eye. God’s “eyes” are asked to see *מֵישָׁרִים*—straightness, equity. Human observers see a fugitive; God, the psalm insists, will see a straight path.
That path is defended in verses 3–5 with a remarkable triple testing:
> בָּחַנְתָּ לִבִּי, פָּקַדְתָּ לַּיְלָה, צְרַפְתַּנִי בַל־תִּמְצָא;  
> זַמֹּתִי בַּל־יַעֲבֹר־פִּי.  
“You have probed my heart, You have visited me by night, You have refined me—you will find nothing; I have resolved that my mouth will not transgress.”
Each verb deepens the inspection. *בָּחַן* is to assay metal, to test its quality; *פָּקַד* is to “visit,” in the sense of inspect or take account; *צָרַף* is to refine silver over fire. Night is when thoughts surface. Under that intense, nocturnal scrutiny, the poet claims, no scheme (*זִמָּה*) was found, no premeditated malice that would cross his lips. Traditional Jewish readers were not blind to the audacity here. Rashi, who reads the psalm against the backdrop of David and Bathsheba, glosses “You visited me by night” as the moment of that sin and still hears David saying: once judged and chastened, my heart and speech are aligned.
Verse 4, syntactically gnarled, anchors this innocence in obedience:
> לִפְעֻלּוֹת אָדָם, בִּדְבַר שְׂפָתֶיךָ;  
> אֲנִי שָׁמַרְתִּי אׇרְחוֹת פָּרִיץ.  
“As for human deeds—by the word of Your lips—I have kept away from the paths of the violent.”
The “word of Your lips” is Torah, the revealed will. *אׇרְחוֹת פָּרִיץ*—“paths of the violent, the lawless one”—are the shortcuts of those who seize by force what they cannot obtain by right. Many medievals hear behind this line the stories in 1 Samuel where David refuses to murder Saul even when he can. He “kept” himself from that violent path precisely because of “the word of [God’s] lips.”
Verse 5 continues the travel metaphor:
> תָּמֹךְ אֲשֻׁרַי בְּמַעְגְּלוֹתֶיךָ;  
> בַּל־נָמוֹטּוּ פְּעָמָי.  
“Hold firm my steps in Your tracks; let my feet not slip.”
*מַעְגָּל* is not just a “path” but a track worn into the ground—a wagon-rut produced by repeated passage. The poet asks that his steps cling to those divine grooves. Malbim, with psychological acuity, notes that sometimes righteousness itself requires leaving the “straight” road—showing courage against the wicked, even harshness—and that it is precisely in those morally complex detours that one needs God to keep one from sliding into cruelty.
The psalm thus opens as a kind of spiritual affidavit: my lips are clean, my thoughts have been smelted, my feet have not followed the brigand’s trail. Only then does the tone become unapologetically petitionary.
#### The center: hesed and hiding
Verses 6–9 turn from defense to plea, and the rhetoric softens from forensic to intimate:
> הַפְלֵה חֲסָדֶיךָ מוֹשִׁיעַ חוֹסִים;  
> מִמִּתְקוֹמְמִים בִּימִינֶךָ.  
“Make wondrous Your steadfast love, O savior of those who seek refuge, from those who rise up [against them] by Your right hand.”
The verb *הַפְלֵה* (“make wondrous, set apart”) comes from a root meaning “to distinguish” or “do something extraordinary.” In Exodus 8:18 God says, “וְהִפְלֵיתִי בַּיּוֹם הַהוּא אֶת־אֶרֶץ גֹּשֶׁן”—“I will set apart on that day the land of Goshen” from Egypt’s plagues. Here the psalmist asks for that same kind of visible separation between himself and his enemies, a public display of *חֶסֶד*—covenant loyalty—toward “those who take refuge” in God.
Immediately comes the most tender pair of images in the psalm:
> שָׁמְרֵנִי כְאִישׁוֹן בַּת־עָיִן;  
> בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנִי.  
“Guard me like the apple of the eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings.”
*אִישׁוֹן בַּת־עָיִן* is literally the “little man” in the “daughter of the eye”—the tiny human reflection one sees in another’s pupil. Deuteronomy 32:10 uses the same phrase for God’s care of Israel in the wilderness: “יִצְּרֶנְהוּ כְּאִישׁוֹן עֵינוֹ” (“He guarded him like the apple of His eye”). To harm that “little man” is to strike the organ of sight itself. Zechariah 2:8 intensifies the image: “הַנֹּגֵעַ בָּכֶם נֹגֵעַ בְּבָבַת עֵינוֹ”—“whoever touches you touches the apple of His eye.” Psalm 17 joins that tradition: the speaker asks to be the point where God’s gaze focuses and therefore the point God instinctively shields.
The “shadow of Your wings” belongs to a small constellation of psalms. Psalm 36:8 says, “וּבְנֵי אָדָם בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ יֶחֱסָיוּן”—“Human beings take refuge in the shadow of Your wings”; Psalm 57:2: “בְּצֵל־כְּנָפֶיךָ אֶחְסֶה עַד יַעֲבֹר הַוּוֹת”—“In the shadow of Your wings I take refuge, until calamities pass.” On the surface it is the picture of a bird sheltering its young. Yet in Israel’s temple, the Ark of the Covenant was overshadowed by cherubim whose wings met above it (Exodus 25:20). To be hidden under God’s wings is also to be hidden under that canopy in the sanctuary. The metaphor is double: maternal and architectural, intimate and cultic.
What drives him there are “the wicked who despoil me … my enemies who encircle me” (v. 9). The verb *יַקִּיפוּ* (“encircle”) and the phrase “hem in our steps” (v. 11) belong to the same military-hunting lexicon as other laments: “הֽוּא־יוֹצִיא מֵרֶשֶׁת רַגְלָי” (“He will free my feet from the net,” Ps 25:15). Psalm 31 combines both net and shelter: “תּוֹצִיאֵנִי מֵרֶשֶׁת זוּ טָמְנוּ לִי … תַסְתִּירֵם בְּסֵתֶר פָּנֶיךָ” (“You free me from the net they hid for me … You hide them in the shelter of Your face,” Ps 31:5,21). Psalm 17 stands in that cluster: enemies tightening the circle, God offering a hidden place.
#### The enemies and the “men of the world”
Verses 10–12 anatomize the pursuers:
> חֶלְבָּמוֹ סָגְרוּ; פִּימוֹ דִּבְּרוּ בְגֵאוּת.  
“They have closed their fat; their mouth speaks with arrogance.”
In biblical physiology, *חֵלֶב* is the rich fat around the organs, especially the heart. Job 15:27 says of the wicked man, “כִּי־כִסָּה פָנָיו בְּחֶלְבּוֹ”—“he covered his face with his fat.” To “close the fat” is to seal off the inner seat of feeling. The psalm does not say they lack information; it says they have shut down compassion. That interior callousness pairs with external swagger: “their mouth speaks *בְּגֵאוּת*”—in pride. The internal organ is sealed; the public voice is loud.
By verse 12, the many foes are distilled into one archetypal predator:
> דִּמְיֹנוֹ כְאַרְיֵה יִכְסֹף לִטְרֹף, וְכִכְפִיר יֹשֵׁב בְּמִסְתָּרִים.  
“His likeness is like a lion craving to tear, and like a young lion crouching in hiding places.”
The verb *כָּסַף* usually describes yearning (“נִכְסֹף נִכְסַפְתָּ,” “you greatly longed,” Gen 31:30); here the lion “longs” to rend. The young lion “sits in ambush” in the *מִסְתָּרִים*—the very root (*סתר*) used for God’s “hiding” of the psalmist. Both God and the enemy conceal, but with opposite intent: one to shelter, one to pounce.
The petition of verses 13–14 then casts God as warrior:
> קוּמָה ה׳, קַדְּמָה פָנָיו הַכְרִיעֵהוּ;  
> פַּלְּטָה נַפְשִׁי מֵרָשָׁע חַרְבֶּךָ.  
“Arise, YHWH, confront him, bring him down; rescue my life from the wicked—Your sword.”
“Arise” is liturgical battle cry (cf. Num 10:35). “Confront his face” pictures God intercepting the attacker head‑on. The startling phrase “the wicked, *Your sword*” echoes Isaiah’s “Assyria, the rod of My anger” (Isa 10:5): foreign power is God’s instrument of punishment, even as God remains free to break that instrument.
Then comes one of the densest verses in the psalm:
> מִמְתִים יָדְךָ ה׳, מִמְתִים מֵחֶלֶד חֶלְקָם בַּחַיִּים;  
> וּצְפוּנְךָ תְּמַלֵּא בִטְנָם, יִשְׂבְּעוּ בָנִים,  
> וְהִנִּיחוּ יִתְרָם לְעוֹלְלֵיהֶם.  
“From mortals, by Your hand, O YHWH; from mortals of the world, whose portion is in [this] life—  
with Your hidden treasure You fill their belly; they are sated with children, and leave their surplus to their babes.”
*חֶלֶד* names not “world” in the spatial sense but the span of life—the transient era in which one is alive. Psalm 49 addresses “כָּל יֹשְׁבֵי חָלֶד,” “all who dwell in this fleeting world” (v. 2). Here “mortals of *cheled*” are those whose horizon is bounded by mortality. Their “portion” (*חֵלֶק*) is strictly *בַּחַיִּים*—within this life. God, ironically, grants them what they want: full stomachs, full quivers, estates large enough to leave an *excess* (*יֶתֶר*) to grandchildren. Radak is blunt: they “have no hope for the world to come.” The problem is not that they enjoy good things, but that they mistake those goods for the whole.
The Sages occasionally read this verse more darkly and more concretely. Torah Temimah cites a Talmudic teaching that links “וּצְפוּנְךָ תְּמַלֵּא בִטְנָם” to the curious claim that placing one’s bed north-south leads to male offspring: God’s “hidden things” filling the belly in this reading is literally the womb’s fruit. Other midrashim tie “from men, Your hand” to God’s granting martyrs like Rabbi Akiva the chance to “die by Your hand,” fulfilling “with all your soul” even at the cost of life (Berakhot 61b).
#### “As for me” and the awakening
Against those “men of *cheled*” the final verse sets a starkly different appetite:
> אֲנִי בְצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ;  
> אֶשְׂבְּעָה בְהָקִיץ תְּמוּנָתֶךָ.  
“As for me, in righteousness I shall behold Your face; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Your likeness.”
The pronoun *אֲנִי*—“I”—is adversative: *they* have their portion in this life; *I*, by contrast, want this. The frame of *צֶדֶק* closes: he began with “Hear, O YHWH, justice” and ends “in righteousness I shall behold Your face.” The verb *אֶחֱזֶה* belongs to the vocabulary of vision used for prophets; Numbers 24:4 calls Balaam “חֹזֶה מַחֲזֵה שַׁקַּי,” “the seer of the vision of Shaddai.” Here the object is God’s *פָּנִים*—face or presence. Elsewhere that face is deadly to mortals (“no one shall see Me and live,” Exod 33:20), yet Moses is allowed to behold God’s *תְּמוּנָה*—form (Num 12:8). Psalm 17 dares to extend that Mosaic privilege: the end of righteousness is not safety but sight.
The crucial phrase is *בְּהָקִיץ*—“when I awake.” The same verb describes waking from ordinary sleep (1 Sam 26:12) and, in prophetic and apocalyptic texts, rousing from death: “רַבִּים מִיְּשֵׁנֵי אַדְמַת־עָפָר יָקִיצוּ” (“Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake,” Dan 12:2). Given the immediate contrast with those whose portion is only “in life,” many Jewish commentators, from Radak onward, take Psalm 17 into that eschatological register: when I awake from the long sleep, I will be satisfied not with belly or descendants but with Your *temunah*.
That word *תְּמוּנָה* is itself risky. It is the very term the Decalogue uses in forbidding images: “לֹא תַעֲשֶׂה לְךָ פֶסֶל וְכָל־תְּמוּנָה” (“You shall not make for yourself a sculptured image or any form,” Exod 20:4). God’s *temunah* is precisely what must not be manufactured. Yet Numbers 12:8 says of Moses, “וּתְמֻנַת ה׳ יַבִּיט”—“he beholds the form of YHWH.” Psalm 17 stands delicately between these: the image is not one the worshiper creates; it is the self-disclosure God grants. Maimonidean readers tried to “dematerialize” the line, reading it as intellectual apprehension of divine truth. Mystics and liturgists were more literal. In the Sefardi priestly blessing, when the Kohanim proclaim, “יָאֵר ה׳ פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ” (“May YHWH make His face shine upon you,” Num 6:25), the congregation responds with this very verse: “אֲנִי בְצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ; אֶשְׂבְּעָה בְהָקִיץ תְּמוּנָתֶךָ.” Liturgically, the Levitical wish for God’s shining face becomes a promise of its eventual sight.
One remarkable rabbinic comment, preserved in Bava Batra 10a, goes further. Rabbi Dostai notes that when a person gives a coin to the poor, “הרי זה זוכה ומקבל פני שכינה”—he merits to “receive the face of the Presence,” and he cites our verse: “אֲנִי בְצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ.” The “righteousness” that leads to vision is not abstract virtue but concrete justice—*tzedakah*.
In the end, Psalm 17 is about what finally satisfies. The “men of the world” are stuffed with treasure, children, and legacy; the psalmist wants a different fullness. Twice the root שׂ־ב־ע (“be sated”) is used: “they are sated with sons” (v. 14), “I shall be sated with Your likeness” (v. 15). Help now, yes; protection, certainly. But the horizon of the prayer is not merely survival or vindication. It is the awakening into a gaze.
## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use
#### Full psalm
In the Eastern (Edot HaMizrach) tradition, Psalm 17 is recited in full on Yom Kippur morning as part of an expanded *Pesukei de‑Zimra*. There it becomes a communal “prayer of the accused” on the Day of Judgment, the congregation taking David’s language—“שִׁמְעָה ה׳ צֶדֶק … בְּלֹא שִׂפְתֵי מִרְמָה” (“Hear, O LORD, justice … from lips without deceit,” vv. 1–2)—into its own mouth. The same tradition also inserts the psalm into the lengthy biblical preface to the *Selichot* of Yom Kippur eve, again stressing the juridical atmosphere.
#### Key verses
Verse 2, “מִלְּפָנֶיךָ מִשְׁפָּטִי יֵצֵא; עֵינֶיךָ תֶּחֱזֶינָה מֵישָׁרִים” (“From before You let my judgment go forth; may Your eyes behold what is right”), is quoted in an Ashkenazic *piyyut* for Rosh Hashanah, woven into the *Kedushah* of the *Musaf* Amidah. The poet pleads: “מִלְּפָנֶיךָ מִשְׁפָּטִי יֵצֵא”—“let my verdict come forth from You,” framing the day as a cosmic court session.
Verse 13, “פַּלְּטָה נַפְשִׁי מֵרָשָׁע חַרְבֶּךָ” (“Rescue my life from the wicked—Your sword”), appears in a special *El Maleh Rachamim* for the martyrs of the 1648–49 massacres, recited on the fast of 20 Sivan. There it becomes a plea for God to avenge “the blood of Your servants,” re‑reading the individual peril of Psalm 17 against Jewish historical catastrophe.
Verse 15, “אֲנִי בְצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ; אֶשְׂבְּעָה בְהָקִיץ תְּמוּנָתֶךָ,” is prominent in Sefardi *Birkat Kohanim*. When the priests recite “יָאֵר ה׳ פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ” (“May YHWH cause His face to shine upon you”), the congregation responds with our verse, explicitly linking the priestly blessing’s shining face with the eschatological vision: “As for me, in righteousness I shall behold Your face; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Your likeness.”
#### Phrases
The double image of verse 8—“שָׁמְרֵנִי כְאִישׁוֹן בַּת־עָיִן; בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנִי” (“Guard me like the apple of the eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings”)—is widely used. In Sefardi weekday and festival *Birkat Kohanim*, when the priest pronounces “וְיִשְׁמְרֶךָ” (“and may He guard you,” Num 6:24), the congregation replies: “שָׁמְרֵנוּ כְאִישׁוֹן בַּת־עָיִן; וּבְצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנוּ”—“Guard us like the apple of the eye; and in the shadow of Your wings hide us.” In the *Seudah Revi‘it* (the fourth meal after Shabbat) in Mizrachi communities, worshipers pray: “בְּכֹחַ סְגֻלָּתָהּ שָׁמְרֵנוּ כְאִישׁוֹן בַּת עָיִן, וּבְצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנוּ”—using Shabbat’s lingering sanctity as the warrant for continued protection.
The opening cry “שִׁמְעָה ה׳ צֶדֶק הַקְשִׁיבָה רִנָּתִי” (“Hear, O LORD, justice; give heed to my cry,” v. 1) is quoted in Sefardi *Selichot* before Rosh Hashanah: “שְׁמַע ה׳ קוֹלֵנוּ … שִׁמְעָה ה׳ צֶדֶק הַקְשִׁיבָה רִנָּתֵנוּ”—“Hear, O LORD, our voice … Hear, O LORD, justice; give heed to our song.” The liturgy thus reads the verse as a communal summons to divine justice, not just an individual’s plea.

## Verse-by-Verse Commentary
**Verse 1**
תְּפִלָּה לְדָוִד; שִׁמְעָה ה׳ צֶדֶק; הַקְשִׁיבָה רִנָּתִי; הַאֲזִינָה תְּפִלָּתִי, בְּלֹא שִׂפְתֵי מִרְמָה.  
“A prayer of David. Hear, O YHWH, justice; give heed to my cry; listen to my prayer, from lips without deceit.”
The superscription *תְּפִלָּה לְדָוִד* (“A prayer of David”) appears on only a handful of psalms. It highlights not genre so much as intensity: this is not praise that spills out almost involuntarily, but a crafted plea.
The four cola of the verse sketch the psalm’s whole posture. First, “שִׁמְעָה ה׳ צֶדֶק”—literally, “hear, O YHWH, *justice*.” Unusually, the object of “hear” is not “my words” or “my voice” but the abstract *צֶדֶק*. The speaker so identifies with his case that he can call his own cause “justice” and ask God to side with it. Radak paraphrases: “שְׁמַעָה תְּפִלָּתִי שֶׁהִיא בְּצֶדֶק”—“Hear my prayer, which is in righteousness.”
The next two verbs, “הַקְשִׁיבָה רִנָּתִי; הַאֲזִינָה תְּפִלָּתִי,” intensify the appeal. All three hearing verbs—*שמע, הקשיב, האזין*—are near-synonyms, but their repetition is not empty ornament. Biblical poetry habitually uses such parallelism: the second line “answers” the first with variation, extension, or intensification. Here the triad produces urgency: “hear … give heed … listen.” The noun *רִנָּה* (“ringing cry”) often carries a double edge—it can mean joyful song or anguished entreaty. In this context, like 1 Kings 8:28 (“לִשְׁמֹעַ אֶל־רִנַּת עַבְדְּךָ וְאֶל־תְּחִנָּתוֹ”), it is the shout of prayer.
The final clause, “בְּלֹא שִׂפְתֵי מִרְמָה,” establishes the moral ground of the petition. *מִרְמָה* is deceit, scheming falseness. To say literally “not with lips of deceit” is to claim that there is no gap between inner state and outer speech, no hidden agenda. Meiri glosses: “שֶׁלִּבּוֹ וּפִיו שָׁוִים”—“for his heart and his mouth are the same.”
This line resonates with other places where the psalmist asks to be spared deceitful speech. Psalm 120:2 cries, “ה׳ הַצִּילָה נַפְשִׁי מִשְּׂפַת־שֶׁקֶר מִלָּשׁוֹן רְמִיָּה” (“O LORD, save me from lying lips, from a deceitful tongue”). Here, the speaker asserts he is on the other side of that line: his own lips are not false.
In liturgy, this verse’s prologue has been heard as a model of how to ask for a just hearing. Sefardi *Selichot* echo it almost verbatim: “שִׁמְעָה ה׳ צֶדֶק, הַקְשִׁיבָה רִנָּתֵנוּ, הַאֲזִינָה תְּפִלָּתֵנוּ”—“Hear, O LORD, justice; give heed to *our* cry, listen to *our* prayer.” The community steps into David’s role, daring to say that at least in this act of confession and return, their lips are free of duplicity.
**Verse 2**
מִלְּפָנֶיךָ מִשְׁפָּטִי יֵצֵא; עֵינֶיךָ תֶּחֱזֶינָה מֵישָׁרִים.  
“From before You let my judgment come forth; may Your eyes behold what is upright.”
If verse 1 demanded a hearing, verse 2 specifies the court. “מִלְּפָנֶיךָ מִשְׁפָּטִי יֵצֵא”—“from before You let my *mishpat* go out.” *מִשְׁפָּט* is verdict as much as process; the speaker wants a decision that originates “from before” God’s face. In royal courts, to “see the king’s face” was to have one’s case heard and decided (cf. 2 Sam 14:24). The psalmist bypasses any human tribunal and appeals directly to the heavenly one.
The second line asks that God’s “eyes” perceive *מֵישָׁרִים*—uprightness, straightness. The noun comes from the root ישר (“straight”) and is often used in an ethical sense. Psalm 58:2 rebukes corrupt judges: “הַאַֻמְנָם אֵלֶם צֶדֶק תְּדַבֵּרוּן, מֵישָׁרִים תִּשְׁפְּטוּ בְּנֵי אָדָם?”—“Do you indeed speak justice in silence? Do you judge uprightly, O sons of man?” Here the appeal is the inverse: “Your eyes behold what is upright”—see the straightness of my path.
The verse also participates in a wider biblical conversation about divine and human perception. God says to Samuel, “כִּי הָאָדָם יִרְאֶה לַעֵינַיִם, וַה׳ יִרְאֶה לַלֵּבָב” (“A human sees what is before the eyes, but YHWH sees the heart,” 1 Sam 16:7). Psalm 17 leans into that difference: whatever others see, God’s eyes perceive the *מֵישָׁרִים* beneath.
In Ashkenazic Rosh Hashanah liturgy, this line is pressed into service in a *piyyut* embedded in the *Kedushah*: “עֵינֶיךָ תֶּחֱזֶינָה מֵישָׁרִים, וְיִזָּכֵר לְפָנֶיךָ צִדְקַת הַתָּם”—“May Your eyes behold what is right, and may the righteousness of the pure one be remembered before You.” The collective anxiety about the coming year is answered not by wishful thinking but by this hope: that God’s way of seeing is straighter than ours.
Finally, the movement from ears (v. 1) to eyes (v. 2) foreshadows the psalm’s whole arc. It begins with God hearing the just case; it ends with the psalmist beholding God’s face. Hearing and seeing, plea and vision, are paired from the outset.
**Verse 3**
בָּחַנְתָּ לִבִּי, פָּקַדְתָּ לַּיְלָה, צְרַפְתַּנִי בַל־תִּמְצָא; זַמֹּתִי בַּל־יַעֲבֹר־פִּי.  
“You have tested my heart, You have visited [me] by night, You have refined me, You will find nothing; my plan does not cross my mouth.”
Three verbs describe God’s scrutiny. *בָּחַן* (“test, examine”) is the metallurgist’s verb: Jeremiah 6:27 has, “בֹּחֲן נְתַתִּיךָ בְעַמִּי צֹרֵף”—“I have made you an assayer among My people, a refiner.” *פָּקַד* (“visit, attend to”) ranges from gracious intervention (Gen 21:1) to punitive reckoning (Exod 32:34). Here “visiting by night” suggests God’s unannounced inspection at the hour when pretense usually falls away. *צָרַף* is again the refiner’s term: “כֶּסֶף צָרוּף בַּעֲלִיל לָאָרֶץ” (“silver refined in a furnace on the earth,” Ps 12:7).
The result is expressed with the poetic negative *בַל*: “בַל־תִּמְצָא”—“You will not find [anything].” The second colon clarifies: “זַמֹּתִי בַּל־יַעֲבֹר־פִּי”—“my scheme / intention does not cross my mouth.” *זִמָּה* in biblical usage usually denotes sinister plotting (e.g., in Leviticus for sexual crimes); here, in the first-person form, it denotes what one resolves internally. David says that the sort of dark schemes that can be spoken never even reach his lips. Malbim, with characteristic rigor, reads the line even more strongly: anything unfit to be spoken he tries not even to think.
Traditional Jewish commentators often read this verse through the lens of David’s moral failures. Rashi, following midrash, hears in “You visited [me] by night” an allusion to the Bathsheba episode (“וַיְהִי לְעֵת הָעֶרֶב,” “it happened toward evening,” 2 Sam 11:2). Torah Temimah cites a striking rabbinic expansion: when David later said, “בחנני ה׳ ונסני” (“Examine me, O LORD, and try me,” Ps 26:2), he came to regret having invited such close examination. Our verse, in this reading, is almost retrospective: I was tested; I learned how dangerous it is to volunteer for ordeal.
Whatever the historical hook, the verse gives voice to something most prayers do not: the sense of having been searched to the bottom. It is uncomfortable language for many moderns, but in the psalm it is the ground of audacity. He dares to ask for justice only because he believes God’s night‑lamp has already swept the room.
**Verse 4**
לִפְעֻלּוֹת אָדָם, בִּדְבַר שְׂפָתֶיךָ; אֲנִי שָׁמַרְתִּי אׇרְחוֹת פָּרִיץ.  
“As for human deeds—by the word of Your lips—I have kept [myself from] the paths of the violent.”
This is one of the psalm’s knotty sentences. The opening phrase, *לִפְעֻלּוֹת אָדָם* (“as for the actions of a human”), is hanging: whose actions? toward what? The next phrase, *בִּדְבַר שְׂפָתֶיךָ* (“by the word of Your lips”), steers us: the “actions of a human” are to be measured “according to” God’s revealed word. The most natural reading is: concerning the way humans behave, I have guided myself by Your speech.
The verb “שָׁמַרְתִּי אׇרְחוֹת פָּרִיץ” is usually taken in a privative sense: “I have guarded myself from the paths of the violent,” i.e., have not walked in them. The noun *פָּרִיץ* elsewhere names the brigand or lawless one: Jeremiah 7:11 speaks of the Temple turned into “מְעָרַת פָּרִצִים,” “a den of robbers.” The plural *אָרְחוֹת* (“paths”) recalls wisdom literature’s way of describing a moral life as a way one walks. Proverbs 4:14 warns, “בְּאֹרַח רְשָׁעִים אַל־תָּבֹא, וְאַל־תְּאַשֵּׁר בְּדֶרֶךְ רָעִים”—“Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not walk in the way of evil.”
There is, however, a minority medieval reading—Radak reports it—that takes the line almost as confession: “I have kept the ways of the violent,” i.e., I once behaved like them. That reading turns the psalm toward penitence, but it strains both grammar and context. The surrounding verses press the opposite claim: innocence, not repentance.
Malbim, staying with the plain sense, connects the verse to the narratives in which David refuses to kill Saul. In 1 Samuel 24:7, after sparing Saul in the cave, David calls such a killing “this thing” he will not do: “חָלִילָה לִּי מֵה׳ מֵעֲשׂוֹת הַדָּבָר הַזֶּה.” He holds himself back from the obvious military solution because a prior word—“Do not stretch out your hand against the LORD’s anointed”—binds him. That, in story form, is what our verse says in poetry: by the word from Your lips, I have refused the expedient path.
The verse is also a hinge between God’s testing (v. 3) and the petition for help (v. 5 onward). It says, in effect: the trial of my heart and the choice of my path have both been carried out under the law of Your speech. On that basis I now ask You to act.
**Verse 5**
תָּמֹךְ אֲשֻׁרַי בְּמַעְגְּלוֹתֶיךָ; בַּל־נָמֹטּוּ פְּעָמָי.  
“Hold firm my steps in Your tracks; let my feet not slip.”
The imagery of walking continues, but the verbs shift from past to petition. *תָּמֹךְ אֲשֻׁרַי* can be read as a past (“my steps held fast”) or, as many commentators and translators prefer, as a plea: “Support my steps.” The ambiguity itself is telling: the psalmist’s steadfastness is both something he has done and something he knows he must be given.
*מַעְגְּלוֹתֶיךָ* (“Your tracks”) evokes the circular ruts of wagon‑wheels, a word used figuratively in Proverbs 4:26: “פַּלֵּס מַעְגַּל רַגְלֶךָ”—“Clear the path for your foot.” Here they are God’s ruts: well‑worn ways in which one’s feet can run without constant recalculation. To walk in them is to live within patterns of obedience.
The second colon sharpens the picture: “בַּל־נָמֹטּוּ פְּעָמָי”—“let my feet not slip.” The verb *מוּט* (“slip, totter”) is a stock metaphor for moral or existential instability. Psalm 16:8 uses almost the same phrase: “שִׁוִּיתִי ה׳ לְנֶגְדִּי תָמִיד … בַּל־אֶמּוֹט”—“I have set YHWH before me always … I shall not totter.” Here, the request is more anxious: if You do not hold me in Your tracks, my feet will.
Malbim offers a subtle distinction between *אֹרַח* (a straight road) and *מַעְגָּל* (a circular, roundabout route). Sometimes, he says, the straight virtues—gentleness, humility—must be set aside in order to confront evil or mete justice. One then walks a “circular” detour of harshness or courage that, if unguarded, could degenerate into cruelty. Precisely there, one needs God to keep one’s feet from slipping. The prayer becomes not “keep me from any strong action,” but “let even my necessary detours remain within Your tracks.”
Within the psalm’s legal frame, verse 5 thus completes the description of integrity. The heart has been tested, the mouth has been restrained, the path has been chosen, and now the feet are entrusted to divine support so that the chosen path can be walked without falling.
**Verse 6**
אֲנִי־קְרָאתִיךָ כִּי־תַעֲנֵנִי אֵל; הַט־אׇזְנְךָ לִי, שְׁמַע אִמְרָתִי.  
“I call upon You, for You will answer me, O God; incline Your ear to me, hear my word.”
Here the psalm shifts from recounting to direct address. The perfect “קְרָאתִיךָ” (“I have called You”) and the imperfect “כִּי־תַעֲנֵנִי” (“for You will answer me”) combine past experience with future confidence. Rashi neatly captures it: “כִּי בָּטוּחַ אֲנִי שֶׁתַּעֲנֵנִי”—“for I am confident that You will answer me.”
The address “אֵל” (“God”) is notable. The psalm has used the divine name YHWH repeatedly; here it chooses a title that emphasizes power. Yet the mood is intimate: “הַט־אׇזְנְךָ לִי”—“tilt Your ear to me.” The metaphor pictures God as needing to bend down from stature and distance to hear a small voice. The same idiom appears in Psalm 31:3, “הַטֵּה אֵלַי אָזְנְךָ, מְהֵרָה הַצִּילֵנִי”—“Incline Your ear to me, quickly rescue me.”
The last phrase, “שְׁמַע אִמְרָתִי,” repeats the core request of verse 1 (“שִׁמְעָה … הַאֲזִינָה תְפִלָּתִי”) but with the term *אִמְרָה* (“utterance, word”). Often *אִמְרָה* describes God’s own word (“אִמְרוֹת ה׳ אֲמָרוֹת טְהֹרוֹת,” “the words of YHWH are pure words,” Ps 12:7); here, paradoxically, the human word is dignified with that title. The prayer is not inarticulate groaning; it is an *imrah*, something thought and said.
Meiri sees a careful sequence: only after clarifying his repentance (or integrity) does David begin his petition in earnest, grounding it in the assurance of being heard. The psalm’s architecture mirrors many ancient Near Eastern appeals, which first establish the petitioner’s standing before presenting the request.
The verse also marks a tonal pivot within the psalm. Up to now, David has spoken largely *about* God (You have tested, You have visited). From here through verse 9, he increasingly speaks *to* God. The courtroom scene gives way to direct address; the accused steps forward and speaks.
**Verse 7**
הַפְלֵה חֲסָדֶיךָ, מוֹשִׁיעַ חוֹסִים; מִמִּתְקוֹמְמִים בִּימִינֶךָ.  
“Make wondrous Your steadfast love, O savior of those who take refuge, from those who rise up [against them] by Your right hand.”
The verb *הַפְלֵה* (hiphil of פלא/פלה) means “do something extraordinary, set apart.” In Exodus 8:18, God promises, “וְהִפְלֵיתִי בַיּוֹם הַהוּא אֶת־אֶרֶץ גֹּשֶׁן”—“I will set apart on that day the land of Goshen,” sparing it from plague. Here the psalmist asks God to “set apart” His *חֶסֶד*—His covenantal lovingkindness—by showing it in a way that is unmistakably beyond the ordinary run of providence.
The phrase “מוֹשִׁיעַ חוֹסִים” (“savior of those who take refuge”) functions almost as a divine epithet. To “take refuge” (*חסה*) is to entrust one’s security to a stronger power; in the psalms it becomes shorthand for radical reliance on YHWH: “אַשְׁרֵי כָּל־חוֹסֵי בוֹ” (“happy are all who take refuge in Him,” Ps 2:12).
The final clause, “מִמִּתְקוֹמְמִים בִּימִינֶךָ,” is syntactically compressed. Literally, “from those who rise up by Your right hand.” Does it mean “those who rise up *against* Your right hand,” i.e., rebels against God’s own rule? Or “save [me] by Your right hand from those who rise up [against me]”? Ancient commentators offer both. Ibn Ezra suggests a cutting intermediate: they are people who claim God’s right hand is with them—those who cloak their aggression in religious language. Malbim follows that line: they present themselves as pious, saying God has forsaken David (“God has abandoned him; pursue and seize him,” Ps 71:11), and therefore God must do something spectacular to unmask them.
Theologically, verse 7 is the psalm’s pivot. Up to now the accent has been on *justice*; here *חֶסֶד*—steadfast love, loyalty to the covenant—takes center stage. And the request is not for a private, invisible assurance but a “wondrous” act that draws a bright line between those who run to God for shelter and those who rise up.
In later liturgy, this line is used precisely in that way. A special *Yehi Ratzon* recited during Nisan, after the reading of the tribal princes’ offerings (Numbers 7), pleads: “קוּמָה עֶזְרָתָה לָּנוּ וּפְדֵנוּ לְמַעַן חַסְדֶּךָ. הַפְלֵה חֲסָדֶיךָ מוֹשִׁיעַ חוֹסִים מִמִּתְקוֹמְמִים בִּימִינֶךָ”—explicitly asking that God’s hesed be displayed in a way that rescues His people from their accusers.
**Verse 8**
שָׁמְרֵנִי כְאִישׁוֹן בַּת־עָיִן; בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנִי.  
“Guard me like the apple of the eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings.”
We have already looked at the images in the introduction; here we can dwell on their biblical resonances.
The “apple of the eye” (*אִישׁוֹן בַּת־עָיִן*) is a compact bit of anatomy and metaphor. The diminutive *אִישׁוֹן* (“little man”) refers to the tiny reflected figure one sees in another’s pupil. Deuteronomy 32:10 describes God’s finding Jacob in the wilderness: “יִצְּרֶנְהוּ כְּאִישׁוֹן עֵינוֹ”—“He guarded him as the apple of His eye.” Proverbs 7:2 urges, “שְׁמֹר מִצְוֺתַי וֶחְיֵה, וְתוֹרָתִי כְּאִישׁוֹן עֵינֶיךָ”—“Keep my commandments and live, and my teaching as the apple of your eye.” Zechariah 2:8 gives the sharpest application: “הַנֹּגֵעַ בָּכֶם נֹגֵעַ בְּבָבַת עֵינוֹ”—“whoever touches you touches the apple of His eye.” In that line, to harm Israel is to poke God in the eye.
The second image, “בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ,” participates in a family of “wing” texts. Psalm 36:8–8: “מַה־יָּקָר חַסְדְּךָ אֱלֹקִים, וּבְנֵי אָדָם בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ יֶחֱסָיוּן”—“How precious is Your hesed, O God! Humans take refuge in the shadow of Your wings.” Psalm 57:2: “אֶחֱסֶה עַד יַעֲבֹר הַוּוֹת”—“I will take refuge … until calamities pass.” Psalm 63:8 celebrates the same shelter in the wilderness: “כִּי־הָיִיתָ עֶזְרָתָה לִּי, וּבְצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ אֲרַנֵּן”—“For You have been my help, and in the shadow of Your wings I sing for joy.” The consistency of the cluster—refuge in danger, wings, shadow—suggests a stock metaphor for asylum.
At the same time, temple imagery hovers in the background. Exodus 25:20 describes the cherubim above the Ark: “וְהָיוּ הַכְּרֻבִים פֹּרְשֵׂי כְנָפַיִם לְמַעְלָה, סֹכְכִים בְּכַנְפֵיהֶם עַל־הַכַּפֹּרֶת”—“The cherubim shall spread out their wings on high, covering the cover with their wings.” That verb “covering” (*סכך*) is close to our verse’s “hide” (*סתר*). To be hidden in the shadow of God’s wings is, on one level, to be beneath that cherubic canopy in the Holy of Holies.
Later liturgy takes these words as the quintessential prayer for protection. As mentioned, Sefardi communities respond to “וְיִשְׁמְרֶךָ” in the priestly blessing with “שָׁמְרֵנִי כְאִישׁוֹן בַּת עָיִן בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנִי.” And the Saturday-night *Seudah Revi‘it* asks that the holiness of Shabbat itself be power to secure such shelter through the week.
The juxtaposition of “guard” (*שמר*) and “hide” (*סתר*), of eye and wing, gives the verse its power. To be guarded as the pupil means to be constantly in view; to be hidden under wings means to be invisible to danger. The worshiper asks to live in that paradox: completely exposed to God, completely concealed from harm.
**Verse 9**
מִפְּנֵי רְשָׁעִים זּוּ שַׁדּוּנִי; אֹיְבַי בְּנֶפֶשׁ יַקִּיפוּ עָלָי.  
“From the wicked who despoil me; my mortal enemies who encircle me.”
The preposition *מִפְּנֵי* (“from before, because of”) here carries a spatial sense: “hide me … from the presence of the wicked,” that is, out of their line of sight. *רְשָׁעִים* are not simply erring people but those who have set themselves against the moral order.
The small word *זוּ* has prompted much discussion. It can function like “this” or “who.” Radak and most medievals take it as a relative: “wicked ones *who* rob me” (*שַׁדּוּנִי* from *שדד*, “to plunder, devastate”). The figurative-language database notes that *שדד* is often used for raiding enemies or oppressive powers (cf. Isa 21:2, Jer 6:26). The psalmist is not facing casual hostility but active despoiling.
The second colon intensifies the danger: “אֹיְבַי בְּנֶפֶשׁ יַקִּיפוּ עָלָי.” The idiom “בְּנֶפֶשׁ” can mean “with their very life” (fiercely) or “against my life.” The verb *יַקִּיפוּ* (“encircle”) returns us to siege imagery. Isaiah 29:3 uses the same root of an invading army: “וְחִנִּיתִי עָלַיִךְ מַחֲנֶה וְצַרְתִּי עָלַיִךְ מָצוֹר וַהֲקִפֹּתִי עָלַיִךְ מְצֻרֹת”—“I will encamp against you … and will encircle you with siegeworks.” 
Meiri reads “בְּנֶפֶשׁ” as “with great desire,” echoing the lion’s craving in verse 12: they are not indifferent executioners but pursue him with appetite. There is a psychological realism here: beyond the legal injustice, the psalmist feels the personal relish his enemies take in his downfall.
The verse marks the turn from internal integrity (vv. 3–5) and divine protection imagery (v. 8) to the gritty reality of opposition. The enemies’ encircling in verse 9 sets up verse 11’s “now they surround our steps” and verse 12’s lion in ambush. The net is tightening.
**Verse 10**
חֶלְבָּמוֹ סָגְרוּ; פִּימוֹ דִּבְּרוּ בְּגֵאוּת.  
“They have closed their fat; their mouth speaks with arrogance.”
We return to the anatomy lesson. *חֶלֶב* (“fat”) in sacrificial texts names the rich suet reserved for God (“כָּל־חֵלֶב לַה׳,” “all fat is for YHWH,” Lev 3:16). In anthropological context, it can be a metaphor for grossness and insensitivity. Psalm 119:70 says, “טָפַשׁ כַּחֵלֶב לִבָּם”—“their heart is dull like fat.” Job 15:27 describes the wicked man’s prosperity as covering his face with fat.
“חֶלְבָּמוֹ סָגְרוּ” probably means “they have shut up their [heart‑]fat,” i.e., closed off their inner responsiveness. Some translators, uneasy with the image, emend to *לִבָּם* (“their heart”), but the Masoretic reading is well attested, and the combination with the second colon (mouth arrogance) is suggestive: inside, a sealed, insensitive core; outside, a proud, loud mouth.
“פִּימוֹ דִּבְּרוּ בְּגֵאוּת” literally, “their mouth has spoken in pride.” The singular “mouth” with plural verb suggests the enemies speaking as one; their many voices form a single arrogant discourse. The noun *גֵּאוּת* names pride rising up like a wave (from גאה, “to be high, exalted”).
Psalm 73:7 uses a closely related combination: “יָצָא מֵחֵלֶב עֵינֵמוֹ; עָבְרוּ מַשְׂכִּיּוֹת לֵבָב”—“their eyes bulge from fat; the imaginations of their heart overflow.” There, inner fatness leads to moral and imaginative excess. Our verse compresses the process: inner fat closed, outer speech swollen with pride.
In Psalm 12, the “smooth lips” and “tongue that speaks great things” of the wicked (vv. 3–4) trigger God’s arising on behalf of the oppressed. Psalm 17’s language is sharper: not just smooth manipulation but closed compassion. The image is physiologically odd, but that very oddity makes it memorable. It is how a righteous sufferer explains cruelty: not as mere error, but as the work of people who have deliberately numbed themselves.
**Verse 11**
אַשֻּׁרֵינוּ עַתָּה סְבָבוּנוּ; עֵינֵיהֶם יָשִׁיתוּ לִנְטוֹת בָּאָרֶץ.  
“Our steps—now they surround us; their eyes they set to stretch out over the earth.”
The first word, *אַשֻּׁרֵינוּ* (“our steps”), shifts the perspective from “me” to “us”—David and his companions? The consonantal text of the verb that follows can be read “סְבָבֻנִי” (they surrounded me) or “סְבָבוּנוּ” (they surrounded us); the Masoretic marginal reading (Qere) favors the plural. Radak notes the tension: David is the main target, yet others share his fate.
“עַתָּה” (“now”) injects urgency. The encirclement is not a past memory or a hypothetical threat; it is happening. The image deepens what verse 9 began: not just being watched but having one’s very steps hemmed in, cut off from exit routes.
The second colon describes the pursuers’ eyes: “עֵינֵיהֶם יָשִׁיתוּ לִנְטוֹת בָּאָרֶץ.” Literally, “their eyes they set to stretch out on the earth.” The verb *נָטָה* (“bend, stretch out”) can take the sense of “spread out, extend [a net, a snare].” Radak and later Metzudat David understand the line as “they set their eyes on our path to spread out [their net] in the land to catch us.” The figurative-language data confirm this as a standard hunting image: Psalm 140:6 speaks of arrogant men who “טָמְנוּ … פַּח לִי … פָרְשׂוּ רֶשֶׁת”—“laid a snare for me … spread a net” near the path.
There is an ironic contrast between “their eyes” in this verse and “Your eyes” in verse 2. God’s eyes “behold what is straight”; their eyes scan the earth for the best place to trap. Two ways of seeing, one for equity, one for predation.
The line also has echoes in related psalms. Psalm 142, another “prayer” from a cave, says: “בְּאֹרַח־זוּ אֲהַלֵּךְ טָמְנוּ פַח לִי” (“In the way where I walk, they have hidden a snare for me,” v. 4). Psalm 31:5, already cited, speaks of “the net they have hidden for me.” Psalm 17 shares vocabulary and situation: a righteous person, physically confined, aware that his every move is tracked by those who wish him harm.
**Verse 12**
דִּמְיֹנוֹ כְאַרְיֵה יִכְסֹף לִטְרֹף; וְכִכְפִיר יֹשֵׁב בְּמִסְתָּרִים.  
“His likeness is like a lion longing to tear, and like a young lion sitting in hiding places.”
The singular “דִּמְיֹנוֹ” (“his likeness”) pulls the plural enemies into one representative figure. Radak explicitly identifies this with Saul in David’s life story; more generally it functions as the archetypal assailant.
The mixed simile has two parts. First, “כְאַרְיֵה יִכְסֹף לִטְרֹף”—“like a lion yearning to tear.” As noted earlier, *כָּסַף* (“to long, desire”) usually appears in contexts of homesickness or desire (“נִכְסֹף נִכְסַפְתָּ לְבֵית אָבִיךָ,” “you longed greatly for your father’s house,” Gen 31:30). Here the lion is emotionally charged: he doesn’t just eat; he craves. The prey’s suffering is, in the image, almost an object of appetite.
Second, “וְכִכְפִיר יֹשֵׁב בְּמִסְתָּרִים”—“and like a young lion sitting in hiding places.” *כְּפִיר* is the young lion, not yet full‑grown. The verb “יֹשֵׁב” (“sitting”) in “hiding places” (*מִסְתָּרִים*) evokes the crouched ambush of a hunter. Lamentations 3:10 uses similar language: “דֹּב אֹרֵב הוּא לִי, אַרְיֵה בְּמִסְתָּרִים”—“He is to me like a lurking bear, like a lion in hiding places.”
The use of animal imagery to depict enemies is common. Psalm 7:3 fears, “פֶּן־יִטְרֹף כַּאֲרִי נַפְשִׁי”—“lest, like a lion, he tear my soul.” Psalm 22 combines bulls, dogs, and lions to describe the forces around the suffering figure. The lion is a natural choice: powerful, relentless, unappeasable.
There is also an implied contrast with God’s “wings.” Both lion and mother bird use their bodies to shelter or destroy, but in opposite ways. The enemy crouches unseen in *hiding places*; God hides the psalmist in the *shadow of His wings*. Both act in secret; only one’s secrecy is merciful.
In the Rosh Hashanah shofar liturgy of some Eastern communities, this verse is recited together with verses 7–8: first the threat (“like a lion longing to tear”), then the plea (“make wondrous Your hesed … guard me as the apple of the eye”). The liturgical ordering performs in sound what the psalm does in poetry: it refuses to let the lion have the last word.
**Verse 13**
קוּמָה ה׳, קַדְּמָה פָנָיו הַכְרִיעֵהוּ; פַּלְּטָה נַפְשִׁי מֵרָשָׁע חַרְבֶּךָ.  
“Arise, O YHWH, confront him, bring him down; rescue my life from the wicked—Your sword.”
The four imperatives move from mobilization to outcome. “קוּמָה ה׳”—“Arise, O LORD”—is the classic summons of the Divine Warrior, heard when the Ark sets out in the wilderness: “קוּמָה ה׳ וְיָפֻצוּ אֹיְבֶיךָ” (“Rise up, O LORD, and let Your enemies be scattered,” Num 10:35).
“קַדְּמָה פָנָיו” literally means “go before his face.” The verb *קדם* can mean “precede” or “meet.” In this context, as Radak and Meiri note, it implies interception: meet him head‑on before he reaches me. The next verb, *הַכְרִיעֵהוּ* (hiphil of כרע), is “make him kneel,” “cause him to collapse.” The image is of a warrior’s legs buckling under a blow.
“פַּלְּטָה נַפְשִׁי” asks for extraction: *פלט* is to cause to escape, to draw someone out of danger. This word appears earlier in Psalms for God’s rescue from enemies; Psalm 22:5 recalls the ancestors, “בְּךָ בָטְחוּ וַתְּפַלְּטֵמוֹ”—“in You they trusted and You delivered them.”
The phrase “מֵרָשָׁע חַרְבֶּךָ” is ambiguous. It can be read as apposition (“from the wicked, who is Your sword”) or as instrument (“by Your sword”). Rashi and Radak take the first: the wicked person is an instrument of divine judgment, much as Assyria is called “שֵׁבֶט אַפִּי” (“the rod of My anger,” Isa 10:5). Yet the psalmist now asks that the very instrument be turned aside or broken.
This double view—that oppressors can be both morally guilty and, in another sense, tools in God’s hand—is found elsewhere in Scripture and in rabbinic thought. It complicates any neat theodicy, but it also allows a prayer like this one: if You gave them power as a sword, You can also disarm them.
In the memorial *El Maleh Rachamim* for the martyrs of 1648, this verse is adapted into a plea for historical vindication: the “wicked who are Your sword” become the violent regimes through which God, in inscrutable ways, has tested His people. The prayer then turns Psalm 17’s individual cry into a communal hope that the sword will not have the final word.
**Verse 14**
מִמְּתִים יָדְךָ ה׳, מִמְּתִים מֵחֶלֶד חֶלְקָם בַּחַיִּים; וּצְפוּנְךָ תְּמַלֵּא בִטְנָם, יִשְׂבְּעוּ בָנִים, וְהִנִּיחוּ יִתְרָם לְעוֹלְלֵיהֶם.  
“From mortals, by Your hand, O YHWH, from mortals of the fleeting world, whose portion is in [this] life; with Your hidden treasure You fill their belly—they are sated with sons, and leave their surplus to their babes.”
The verse continues the plea of verse 13 but shifts tone. “מִמְּתִים יָדְךָ” repeats and extends “מֵרָשָׁע חַרְבֶּךָ.” Now the enemies are “mortals” (*מֵתִים*, literally “dead ones,” here “people destined to die”), and God’s “hand” is the power by which He grants them success.
The phrase “מִמְּתִים מֵחֶלֶד” adds a temporal dimension. *חֶלֶד* denotes mortal existence, the here‑and‑now life. Psalm 49 calls out to “כָּל יֹשְׁבֵי חָלֶד” (“all who dwell in the world,” v. 2), and later says, “כְּצֹאן לִשְׁאוֹל שַׁתּוּ, מָוֶת יִרְעֵם … וְצִיּוּרָם לְבַלּוֹת שְׁאוֹל, מִזְּבֻל לוֹ”—“Like sheep they are appointed for Sheol, death shall shepherd them … and their form shall waste away in Sheol, far from its lofty abode” (vv. 15–15). Here, the “mortals of *cheled*” are those whose whole horizon is this perishable span. Their “portion” (*חלקם*) is only “in life”—no more.
“וּצְפוּנְךָ תְּמַלֵּא בִטְנָם” is ambiguous in tone. *צְפוּן* is “what is hidden, stored up.” Psalm 31:20 exclaims, “מָה רַב־טוּבְךָ אֲשֶׁר־צָפַנְתָּ לִירֵאֶיךָ”—“How great is Your goodness which You have hidden for those who fear You.” Does Psalm 17 say that even the godless live off God’s hidden goodness? Or is it more ironic: all they get of that goodness is a full stomach? The next lines push toward irony: “יִשְׂבְּעוּ בָנִים, וְהִנִּיחוּ יִתְרָם לְעוֹלְלֵיהֶם”—“they are sated with children, and leave their surplus to their infants.” In a culture where numerous descendants and large estates are the classic signs of blessing, the psalm adds, “That is all.”
Radak sees this as a description of the wicked’s short‑sightedness: they do not hope for the world to come, only for belly and brood. Malbim, more philosophically, sees them as instruments in God’s providence; they are the ones who, by their work, maintain the physical order of the world and are rewarded with worldly goods, but not with God as portion.
Rabbinic interpretation mines the verse in other ways. Torah Temimah notes the passage in Berakhot 5a that uses “וּצְפוּנְךָ תְּמַלֵּא בִטְנָם יִשְׂבְּעוּ בָנִים” to support the idea that aligning one’s bed in a certain direction fosters children: God’s “hidden things” fill the belly in the form of sons. Another midrash, as mentioned, reads “מִמְּתִים יָדְךָ” as those who “die by Your hand,” i.e., martyrs who accept death from God rather than apostasy.
For the psalm’s own argument, however, the main point is contrast. Whatever they get, it is bounded by mortality, divisible among heirs, and soon gone. The next verse’s “as for me” will answer this with a different kind of portion.
**Verse 15**
אֲנִי בְצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ; אֶשְׂבְּעָה בְהָקִיץ תְּמוּנָתֶךָ.  
“As for me, in righteousness I shall behold Your face; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Your likeness.”
The final verse stands as deliberate antithesis to verse 14. There the “men of *cheled*” have their *חלקם* in this life, their belly filled, their progeny secure. Here the psalmist stakes out a different desire.
“אֲנִי בְצֶדֶק” is not just “I” but “as for me” (the Hebrew pronoun can carry that contrastive force). The colloquial might be: “They can have that; I want this.” The phrase “בְצֶדֶק” (“in righteousness”) reaches back to verse 1’s “שִׁמְעָה ה׳ צֶדֶק.” The justice he asked God to hear is also the condition in which he expects to see.
“אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ” is a compressed theology. To “behold God’s face” elsewhere is something mortals cannot survive: “לֹא תוּכַל לִרְאוֹת אֶת־פָּנַי, כִּי לֹא־יִרְאַנִי הָאָדָם וָחָי” (“You cannot see My face, for no human can see Me and live,” Exod 33:20). Yet Israel’s blessing language longs for that face: “יָאֵר ה׳ פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ” (“May YHWH’s face shine upon you,” Num 6:25). Psalm 17 steps into that tension: the face that cannot be seen now will be beheld *then*, and that vision will be the worshiper’s satisfaction.
“אֶשְׂבְּעָה בְהָקִיץ” picks up the satiation vocabulary from verse 14. They are “sated with sons”; I will be sated when I awake. As noted above, *הָקִיץ* can describe ordinary waking, waking from prophetic trance, or waking from death. Isaiah 26:19 uses the related verb of resurrection: “הָקִיצוּ וְרַנְּנוּ שֹׁכְנֵי עָפָר” (“Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust”). Daniel 12:2, with its “יָקִיצוּ” (“will awake”), is the clearest biblical anticipation of general resurrection. Against that background, many Jewish readers—from the medievals through kabbalistic and Hasidic traditions—have heard Psalm 17:15 as a confession of resurrection hope.
Finally, “תְּמוּנָתֶךָ.” As with Moses’ vision in Numbers 12:8, the psalm dares to name the object of ultimate joy as God’s “form” or “likeness.” Maimonides reads such verses metaphorically, as knowing God’s actions and attributes, not any literal “shape.” Mystical traditions are more concrete: the verse undergirds the doctrine of the *Shekhinah*—the indwelling Presence—manifest to the righteous in the world to come.
The Talmud (Bava Batra 10a) gives this line a strongly ethical twist. Rabbi Dostai teaches that one who gives a coin to a poor person merits to “receive the face of the Divine Presence,” and cites, “אֲנִי בְצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ.” “בְצֶדֶק” is read as “in justice”—*tzedakah*. The road to beholding that face, on this reading, runs through concrete acts of righteousness toward the vulnerable.
So the psalm, which began in the lower court—“hear justice, listen to my cry”—ends before a different bench. The ultimate answer to injustice and encirclement is not only deliverance but encounter. It is as if the poet says: whatever verdict You issue about my case now, the only thing that will finally fill me is to wake and see You.
