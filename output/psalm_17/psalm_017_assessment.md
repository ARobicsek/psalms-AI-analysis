# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 17

The existing introduction has real strengths. It sees clearly that Psalm 17 is a “prayer of the accused” that moves from the courtroom to vision, and it traces the contrast between belly-filling prosperity and the satisfaction of beholding God. It makes good use of key Hebrew terms (*tzedeq*, *cheled*, *temunah*), notices the chiastic architecture, and integrates some liturgical reception, especially around verses 8 and 15. The verse-by-verse notes are rich on lexical detail and do a fine job with several difficult cruxes (v. 4; v. 10; v. 14–15), often bringing Radak, Malbim, Meiri, and others into the conversation.

At the same time, there are weaknesses. The prose sometimes lapses into the “annotated article” mode—dense blocks of information, intermittently brilliant but not always shaped for an intelligent non-specialist. Technical terms such as “hiphil,” “chiastic,” or “hitpael” are used without explanation. Some of the more daring claims (e.g., that the wings imagery is “not ornithological but architectural”) could be qualified or nuanced. The connection with related psalms (31, 44, 22, 12, 142), flagged in the research bundle, is barely tapped; there is a missed chance to show how Psalm 17 stands in dialogue with other laments that speak of nets, encirclement, and God’s “hidden face.” 

Several research questions the macro-analysis raised can be answered more directly: the range of *cheled* and its parallels; the cluster of “shadow of Your wings” texts; rabbinic uses in Torah Temimah tying v. 14–15 to male offspring, martyrdom, and the vision of the Shekhinah. Figurative language parallels are cited, but seldom quoted in Hebrew and English so the reader can see the pattern. The liturgical section is informative but scattered; it needs a clearer structure with examples.

The verse commentary is generally strong but uneven. Some verses (1, 8, 15) receive subtle treatment, while others (9, 11, 14) could do more with the figurative-language database, with textual variants, and with the psalm’s structure as a whole. Sound-pattern observations are occasionally overdone or speculative.

The revision should keep the best insights, prune redundancies, define terms, show more texts, and draw a sharper, more continuous line from the opening legal plea to the closing “when I awake” of verse 15.
