# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 17

The existing introduction and commentary have real strengths. They rightly see Psalm 17 as more than a generic lament: a legal plea that opens into a wisdom-like contrast between two forms of “satisfaction”—full bellies and many children versus beholding God’s face. The treatment of verse 15 is especially perceptive, tying תְּמוּנָה both to Moses’ unique vision in Numbers 12:8 and to Deuteronomy 4’s “no form” prohibition, and noticing the inclusio on צֶדֶק from verse 1 to verse 15. The analysis of verse 8’s double metaphor (“apple of the eye” and “shadow of Your wings”) is also rich, and the liturgical connections to Birkat Kohanim and Shabbat songs are well observed.

That said, several weaknesses blunt the force of the work. The temple “incubation” hypothesis is asserted rather confidently on slim evidence; it should be presented as an intriguing possibility, not as near-certainty, and weighed against other readings (night as a standard image for testing, or simply interior moral scrutiny). Verse 14—the crux of the psalm—is handled well but could more clearly weigh the syntactic options and state a preferred reading. Some excellent Torah Temimah material, especially on verses 3, 14, and 15, is only mentioned in passing or not integrated at all; these midrashim illuminate how later readers wrestled with David’s claims. The commentary often cites parallels without quoting them; intelligent readers need to see the Hebrew (with translation) from Deuteronomy 32:10, Proverbs 7:2, Psalm 73:7, etc., rather than being told they exist. 

Figurative language is treated, but the dedicated figurative-language data (for “apple of the eye,” “wings,” lion imagery) is underused. Likewise, the “Related Psalms” (31, 44, 142, 22, 12) are not really brought into the discussion, though they offer a web of shared vocabulary (portion, life, refuge, vindication) that clarifies Psalm 17’s voice. Stylistically, the prose occasionally drifts toward academic density; definitions of terms like “inclusio” and “jussive” should be folded into the text. The liturgical section is promising but could be more systematically organized, showing clearly how particular verses are repurposed in prayer.

The revision below aims to keep the strengths—especially the theological arc—while tightening the speculative claims, integrating more Hebrew evidence and traditional exegesis, and making the prose more lucid for non-specialist but serious readers.
