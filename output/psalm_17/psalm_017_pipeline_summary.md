## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (11)

1. What is the precise cultic context of 'shadow of Your wings' (צל כנפיך, v. 8)—does this refer to cherubim throne in temple, and how does this imagery function in other psalms (36:7, 57:1, 61:4, 63:7, 91:4)?
2. How does 'seeing God's face' (אחזה פניך, v. 15) relate to temple entrance liturgies, theophany traditions, and prohibitions against seeing God (Exod 33:20)? What is the theological development of 'face of God' language in the Psalter?
3. What is the meaning and significance of בהקיץ (awakening, v. 15)—is this literal morning awakening after temple incubation, metaphorical spiritual awakening, or proto-resurrection hope? Compare Job 19:26 and Daniel 12:2.
4. How does תמונה (form/likeness, v. 15) relate to Numbers 12:8 (Moses seeing God's תמונה) and Genesis 1:26 (image/likeness of God in creation)? Is the psalmist claiming mystical vision comparable to Moses?
5. What is the syntactic and theological function of v. 14—are the 'treasured ones' whose bellies are filled the wicked (describing their prosperity) or the righteous (petition for their provision)? How does this affect the contrast with v. 15?
6. What is the meaning of חֶלֶד (v. 14, translated 'fleeting')—is this temporal ('momentary life'), spatial ('world'), or qualitative ('transient existence')? Lexical study needed comparing other uses.
7. How does the protestation of innocence (vv. 3-5) compare to ANE legal oaths, Job's self-imprecations (Job 31), and temple entrance requirements (Psalms 15, 24)? What level of righteousness is being claimed?
8. What is the textual issue in v. 4 (לפעלות אדם בדבר שפתיך אני שמרתי ארחות פריץ), and how do different translations affect the meaning? Does the psalmist claim to have avoided or observed the paths of the violent?
9. How does the shift from plural enemies (vv. 9-11) to singular enemy in lion metaphor (v. 12) function rhetorically? Is this poetic variation, or does the singular represent archetypal evil?
10. What is the relationship between Psalm 17 and Psalm 16 (which also emphasizes God as 'portion' and presence over material goods) and Psalm 73 (which resolves theodicy through sanctuary vision)? Are these a theological cluster?
11. How does the 'apple of the eye' metaphor (אישון בת־עין, v. 8) function across biblical literature (Deut 32:10, Prov 7:2, Zech 2:8), and what is the etymology of this peculiar phrase?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (12)

1. What is the precise meaning and function of the puzzling phrase 'חֶלְבָּמוֹ סָּגְרוּ' (their fat they closed, v.10) - is this idiomatic for hardheartedness, or should it be emended to 'their heart'?
2. How does the 'awakening' (בְּהָקִיץ) in v.15 relate to the night visitation (פָּקַדְתָּ לַּיְלָה) in v.3 - does this frame indicate actual temple incubation ritual where suppliants slept in sanctuary?
3. Why does the psalmist claim to 'behold God's face' (אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ) in v.15 given the theological danger and prohibition of seeing God's face in Exodus 33:20?
4. What is the syntactic and theological function of the notoriously difficult verse 14 - does it describe wicked prosperity (setting up v.15 contrast) or petition for righteous provision?
5. How does תְּמוּנָה (form/image) in v.15 relate to Moses's unique privilege of seeing God's תְּמוּנָה (Num 12:8) and the image of God (צֶלֶם) in Genesis 1:26?
6. Why does the text shift between singular and plural enemy references, particularly the move to singular 'lion' in v.12 after plural 'they' in vv.9-11?
7. What is the meaning of the rare/puzzling word זוּ in v.9 ('רְשָׁעִים זוּ שַׁדּוּנִי') - demonstrative, relative, or textual corruption?
8. How does the phrase 'בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ' (shadow of Your wings, v.8) function - as maternal bird imagery, temple cherubim metaphor, or deliberate dual valence?
9. What does חֶלֶד mean in v.14 ('מֵחֶלֶד') - 'fleeting' (temporal), 'world' (spatial), or something else? How does this affect the wicked vs. righteous contrast?
10. Why does the psalmist use such extraordinarily strong righteousness claims (vv.3-5) - is this hyperbole, ritual language for temple entrance, or sincere moral confidence?
11. How does Psalm 17 relate intertextually to Psalms 16 and 73, which also contrast earthly prosperity with divine presence as ultimate good?
12. What is the significance of the triple imperative opening (שִׁמְעָה, הַקְשִׁיבָה, הַאֲזִינָה in v.1) and the quadruple imperative in v.13 (קוּמָה, קַדְּמָה, הַכְרִיעֵהוּ, פַּלְּטָה)?
