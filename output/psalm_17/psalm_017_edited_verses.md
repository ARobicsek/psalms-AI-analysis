**Verse 1**

תְּפִלָּה לְדָוִד;  
שִׁמְעָ֤ה יְהוָ֨ה ׀ צֶ֗דֶק;  
הַקְשִׁ֥יבָה רִנָּתִ֗י;  
הַאֲזִ֥ינָה תְּפִלָּתִ֑י, בְּ֝לֹ֗א שִׂפְתֵ֥י מִרְמָֽה׃  

“A prayer of David. Hear, O LORD, righteousness; attend to my cry; give ear to my prayer, from lips without deceit.”

The heading תְּפִלָּה לְדָוִד (“A prayer of David”) appears only a handful of times in Psalms. Here it announces that what follows is not a hymn or meditation but an urgent lawsuit in the form of a plea.

The main line is built as a three-step staircase of imperatives: שִׁמְעָה (“hear”), הַקְשִׁיבָה (“pay heed”), הַאֲזִינָה (“give ear”). In Hebrew poetry, this kind of repetition—*anaphora*—is not mere flourish. Each verb slightly intensifies the request: from simple hearing, to focused attention, to the bodily image of God leaning in to catch the words. As the analytical framework puts it, the second and third cola are not tautological; they are “A is so, and what’s more, B”—escalating the same desire.

The object of the first verb, צֶדֶק, is deliberately flexible. It can mean “hear what is right” in the abstract, or “hear my righteous cause,” or “hear, for I am speaking righteousness.” Rashi glosses: “שְׁמַע תְּפִלָּתִי שֶׁהִיא בְּצֶדֶק—Hear my prayer, which is in righteousness.” Ibn Ezra paraphrases: “שִׁמְעָה כִּי צֶדֶק אֲדַבֵּר—Hear, for I speak righteousness.” Either way, the psalmist claims not perfection, but that his appeal itself is morally straight.

The verse ends by circling back to the lips: “from lips without deceit” (בְּלֹא שִׂפְתֵי מִרְמָה). This idiom defines by negation. Instead of saying “my lips speak truth,” he insists that there is no *trickery* in them. The noun מִרְמָה often carries overtones of legal or cultic fraud—false oaths, bent justice, idolatrous half-measures (cf. Zeph 3:13; Ps 24:4). The psalmist wants it clear: his prayer is not an attempt to manipulate God, or to cover guilt with eloquence.

Liturgically, this line is too apt to leave unused. Sephardi *Selichot* recite it as a communal cry: “שִׁמְעָה יְהוָה צֶדֶק, הַקְשִׁיבָה רִנָּתֵנוּ, הַאֲזִינָה תְּפִלָּתֵנוּ—Hear, O LORD, righteousness; attend to *our* cry; give ear to *our* prayer.” The personal protest of innocence gives way, in the mouth of the community, to a collective hope that at least the *act* of crying out is honest enough to be heard.

**Verse 2**

מִלְּפָנֶיךָ מִשְׁפָּטִי יֵצֵא;  
עֵינֶיךָ תֶּחֱזֶינָה מֵישָׁרִים׃  

“Let my judgment come forth from before You; let Your eyes behold what is right.”

The legal setting comes into sharper focus. “Judgment” (מִשְׁפָּט) here is not condemnation but verdict. To say “מִשְׁפָּטִי יֵצֵא” is to imagine a sentence being issued from the high court; the verb יֵצֵא (“go forth”) appears elsewhere in juridical contexts for decrees that “go out” from a royal or priestly body.

The phrase מִלְּפָנֶיךָ (“from before You,” literally “from before Your face”) deepens the image. We are in the heavenly courtroom, standing before the judge’s face, and the psalmist asks that when the verdict emerges from that presence, it be favorable. Some medieval interpreters, like Rashi and Meiri, read the line more obliquely—“May the sins for which I deserve punishment *go out* from before You, and not come in for judgment”—but even their midrashic turn assumes the same judicial scene.

The second colon shifts from God as judge to God as seer: “Your eyes will behold what is upright” (מֵישָׁרִים). The verb חָזָה (“behold”) is the same verb that will reappear in “I shall behold Your face” (אֶחֱזֶה, v. 15). Here it is God who beholds; there, the psalmist. The roles invert across the psalm. The plural noun מֵישָׁרִים, “upright things” or “straightnesses,” can be an abstract plural for moral rightness, or a concrete plural for specific just acts. The psalmist invites God to look long and hard at his record.

Psalm 11 sets up a similar reciprocal seeing: “YHWH is in His holy temple… His eyes behold; His eyelids test the children of humankind. YHWH tests the righteous” (עֵינָיו יֶחֱזוּ, עַפְעַפָּיו יִבְחֲנוּ, Ps 11:4–5). Psalm 17 presses this further: the same eyes that test will, in the end, be met.

**Verse 3**

בָּחַנְתָּ לִבִּי; פָּקַדְתָּ לַּיְלָה; צְרַפְתַּנִי, בַל־תִּמְצָא;  
זַמֹּתִי, בַּל־יַעֲבׇר־פִּי׃  

“You have tested my heart; You have visited [me] by night; You have refined me—you will find nothing; my thought shall not cross my mouth.”

This verse is densely packed with the imagery of assay and metallurgy. The three verbs—בָּחַנְתָּ (“you have examined”), פָּקַדְתָּ (“you have visited/attended to”), צְרַפְתַּנִי (“you have refined/smelted me”)—are in the perfect tense, describing completed past actions. The psalmist does not ask to be tested; he claims that testing has already happened and that he has come through.

The root צָרַף is the technical term for smelting metals to remove dross. Malachi uses it for God’s eschatological purging: “He is like a refiner’s fire… He will sit as a smelter and purifier of silver” (כְּאֵשׁ מְצָרֵף… מְצָרֵף וּמְטַהֵר כָּסֶף, Mal 3:2–3). Psalm 12:7 applies the same metaphor to God’s own words: “The words of YHWH are pure words, silver refined in a crucible on the earth, refined sevenfold” (אִמְרוֹת יְהוָה… כֶּסֶף צָרוּף בַּעֲלִיל לָאָרֶץ מְזֻקָּק שִׁבְעָתָיִם). Our psalmist daringly applies to himself the process reserved elsewhere for silver and for Torah.

The middle verb, פָּקַד (“visit”), broadens the field. BDB, the standard Hebrew lexicon, shows that פקד can mean to attend to graciously, to muster, to punish, or to recall. Here, “visited me by night” evokes God’s nocturnal scrutiny. Is this a literal night in the temple—some sort of vigil or incubation? Or is it the poetic way of saying that in the vulnerable hours, when masks drop, God’s eye is still on the heart? The text allows both, though it nowhere explicitly mentions temple or sleep.

The second colon is compressed. The phrase בַל־תִּמְצָא (“you will not find”) is left hanging; most translators supply “anything” or “wickedness.” The noun זַמָּה normally means a plan or scheme, usually wicked (cf. Prov 24:9, “The scheme of folly is sin”). Here, “זַמֹּתִי, בַּל־יַעֲבׇר־פִּי” can be read, “What I have planned will not cross my mouth”—that is, I do not even speak the sorts of schemes unworthy of utterance. Radak, glossing with later rabbinic tradition, hears a retrospective wince: David regrets having once said “Test me, O LORD,” and wishes those words had never “crossed” his lips.

The Torah Temimah dramatizes this: “He said, ‘If only that scheme had fallen into the mouth of someone who hates me, and I had not spoken such a thing.’” This reading turns our verse into a kind of self-critique: the psalmist has learned that to invite divine refinement is to live under a dangerous honesty.

**Verse 4**

לִפְעֻלּוֹת אָדָם, בִּדְבַר שְׂפָתֶיךָ;  
אֲנִי שָׁמַרְתִּי, אׇרְחוֹת פָּרִיץ׃  

“As for human deeds, by the word of Your lips, I—I have kept [myself from] the paths of the violent.”

This is one of the psalm’s thorniest lines. Literally: “For the deeds of man, by the word of Your lips, I have kept [or: guarded] paths of a violent one (פָּרִיץ).” The syntax does not decide whether the psalmist kept *to* these paths or kept *away from* them.

The broader context points strongly to avoidance. Verse 3 has just claimed inner integrity; verse 5 will ask God to steady his feet “in Your tracks.” It would be jarringly out of character for verse 4 to boast, “I have carefully observed the paths of the violent.” Most medieval commentators therefore insert an understood “from”: “I have guarded myself from the paths of the violent.”

The opening phrase, לִפְעֻלּוֹת אָדָם (“as for human deeds”), probably means: whenever I find myself in the realm of typical human behavior—with all its impulses toward retaliation and self-assertion—I measure my actions “by the word of Your lips” (בִּדְבַר שְׂפָתֶיךָ), that is, by Torah’s commands and prohibitions. The plural פְּעֻלּוֹת evokes repetitive, habitual doings, not a single isolated slip.

The noun פָּרִיץ (“violent, lawless man”) appears only a handful of times, always negatively. Jeremiah condemns the temple as having become “a den of robbers” (מְעָרַת פָּרִצִים, Jer 7:11); Ezekiel uses the word for violent exploiters of the land (Ezek 7:22). To speak of “paths of the violent” (אׇרְחוֹת פָּרִיץ) is to gesture to an entire style of life—predatory, boundary-breaking.

The very awkwardness of the verse may be deliberate. The psalmist sets in tight apposition three things: “human deeds,” “the word of Your lips,” and “paths of the violent.” Without God’s word as a counterweight, “human deeds” easily slide into those paths. Only by constantly hearing “the word of Your lips” as a check does he keep from walking the way that most people find natural.

**Verse 5**

תָּמֹךְ אֲשֻׁרַי בְּמַעְגְּלוֹתֶיךָ;  
בַּל־נָמ֥וֹטּוּ פְעָמָֽי׃  

“Support my steps in Your tracks; let my footsteps not slip.”

After the retrospective claim of verses 3–4 (“You have tested me,” “I have kept”), verse 5 pivots to petition: the psalmist knows he cannot assume future faithfulness on his own. The imperative תָּמֹךְ (“support, uphold”) is addressed to God; the object, אֲשֻׁרַי (“my steps”), repeats the foot imagery that dominates the colon: אֲשֻׁרַי / מַעְגְּלוֹתֶיךָ / פְעָמָי—steps, tracks, footsteps.

The noun מַעְגָּל, from a root meaning “to be round,” denotes a track or “wagon-rut,” a circular or well-worn path. BDB notes its figurative use for conduct or course of life. In Psalm 23:3, God leads “in tracks of righteousness” (בְּמַעְגְּלֵי־צֶדֶק); Proverbs 4:11 speaks of “the tracks of uprightness” (בְּמַעְגְּלֵי־יֹשֶׁר). Here they are “Your tracks”—either the ways God prescribes or the ways He Himself walks.

The Malbim offers a psychologically acute gloss: the *orach* is a straight road, the obvious moral line; the *ma‘gal* is the roundabout route one sometimes must take to reach the right goal. Mercy, humility, and gentleness are the main road, he suggests, but at times one must deviate toward harshness or boldness in dealing with the wicked. In such morally complex “tracks,” divine support is crucial, lest the temporary deviation become a permanent detour.

The second colon, “let my footsteps not slip” (בַּל־נָמוֹטּוּ פְעָמָי), uses a verb (מוּט) that recurs in the Psalms as the antonym of trust. “I have set YHWH always before me… I shall not be moved” (בַּל־אֶמּוֹט, Ps 16:8); “He will not let your foot be moved” (אַל־יִתֵּן לַמּוֹט רַגְלֶךָ, Ps 121:3). The psalmist does not presume that because he has stood so far, he will stand unaided; the moral life is a path on which even the just can skid.

**Verse 6**

אֲנִֽי־קְרָאתִ֣יךָ כִּֽי־תַעֲנֵ֣נִי אֵל;  
הַט־אׇזְנְךָ לִי; שְׁמַע אִמְרָתִי׃  

“I—I have called upon You, for You will answer me, O God; incline Your ear to me; hear my word.”

This verse marks a clear rhetorical shift from describing God’s past testing to present address. The pronoun אֲנִי (“I”) is fronted, highlighting the speaker’s personal relationship: not just “I call,” but “*I*—I have called You.” The perfect קְרָאתִיךָ (“I have called You”) presents prayer as an ongoing habit, not a one-off experiment.

The clause כִּי־תַעֲנֵנִי אֵל can be read either as causal—“for You will answer me”—or as an expression of confidence: I call *because* I know You will answer. Rashi writes bluntly: “כִּי בָטוּחַ אֲנִי שֶּׁתַעֲנֵנִי—I am confident that You will answer me.” Grammar and theology thus line up: the future tense expresses a settled expectation.

Interestingly, the divine name here is אֵל (“God” as “Mighty One”), rather than the covenant name YHWH that dominates the psalm. This may subtly invoke God’s sheer power, as opposed to His covenant loyalty.

The second colon returns to the “ear” imagery of verse 1: “Incline Your ear to me” (הַט־אׇזְנְךָ לִי). The verb נָטָה (“incline, bend”) is bodily—one has to lean down to listen. Deuteronomy 32:1 begins Moses’ song with a similar picture: “Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak” (הַאֲזִינוּ הַשָּׁמַיִם), imagining the skies literally stooping to hear. Here, strikingly, that physical posture is ascribed to God.

The final phrase, “hear my word” (שְׁמַע אִמְרָתִי), uses אִמְרָה, a term elsewhere associated with God’s own words (“The words of YHWH are pure words,” Ps 12:7). The psalmist implicitly accords his prayer a certain crafted weight; it is not random outcry but shaped speech, worthy of attention.

Structurally, verses 1 and 6 frame the first half of the psalm with appeals to hearing: three imperatives at the start, then “I call… incline Your ear… hear” here. The lawsuit is lodged; now the petitioner waits to see if the Judge will indeed “answer.”

**Verse 7**

הַפְלֵה חֲסָדֶיךָ, מוֹשִׁיעַ חוֹסִים;  
מִמִּתְקוֹמְמִים בִּימִינֶךָ׃  

“Make wonderful Your steadfast loves, O Savior of those who take refuge, from those who rise up against [them] by Your right hand.”

The imperative הַפְלֵה is from פלא, a root denoting that which is wondrous or set apart. In prose it can mean “distinguish” (“I will set apart the land of Goshen,” וְהִפְלֵיתִי, Exod 8:18); in hymns it shades into “do marvels” (cf. עֹשֵׂה פֶּלֶא, “worker of wonders,” Exod 15:11). Here, “Make wonderful Your חסדים” asks God to let His covenantal kindnesses show themselves in unmistakably extraordinary fashion.

חֶסֶד in biblical Hebrew is not generic kindness but loyal love within a relationship—parent to child, king to subject, God to Israel. The plural חֲסָדֶיךָ (“Your kindnesses”) evokes a history of such acts. Psalm 31 later says, “Blessed be YHWH, for He has made His steadfast love wondrous to me in a besieged city” (כִּי הִפְלִיא חַסְדּוֹ לִי, Ps 31:22), echoing our phrase.

The appositive מוֹשִׁיעַ חוֹסִים (“Savior of those who take refuge”) combines two favorite psalmic words. The participle מוֹשִׁיעַ (“one who saves”) names God by His characteristic action; the participle חוֹסִים (from חסה, “to take refuge”) designates those who throw themselves on His protection. Psalm 2 ends: “Happy are all who take refuge in Him” (אַשְׁרֵי כָּל־חוֹסֵי בּוֹ, 2:12). Our verse crystallizes that theology: God’s wonders are especially visible in how He rescues those with no one else to trust.

The final phrase, מִמִּתְקוֹמְמִים בִּימִינֶךָ, is ambiguous. Grammatically, it could mean “from those who rise up against [me], by Your right hand,” or “from those who rise up against Your right hand.” Radak takes the latter: because God has given David the kingship, rebels against David are in effect rebels “against Your right hand,” i.e., against God’s own action. Either way, the “right hand” (יָמִין) is a standard image for power: “Your right hand, O LORD, glorious in power; Your right hand, O LORD, shatters the enemy” (יְמִינְךָ יְהוָה, Exod 15:6).

In the liturgy for the first days of Nisan, when communities read the offerings of the tribal princes (Numbers 7), this verse is invoked in *Yehi Ratzon* prayers: “קוּמָה עֶזְרָתָה לָּנוּ… הַפְלֵה חֲסָדֶיךָ מוֹשִׁיעַ חוֹסִים—Arise to help us… Make wondrous Your kindnesses, O Savior of those who take refuge.” The ancient tribal dedication of the altar is thus remembered through a plea for present-day wonders.

**Verse 8**

שׇׁמְרֵנִי כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת־עָיִן;  
בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנִי׃  

“Guard me like the pupil, the daughter of the eye; in the shadow of Your wings hide me.”

Few biblical lines have compressed so much tenderness into so few words. The first image, “the pupil, the daughter of the eye” (אִישׁוֹן בַּת־עָיִן), is an anatomical idiom. אִישׁוֹן is a diminutive of אִישׁ (“man”), likely from the tiny human reflection one sees in another’s eye; בַּת־עָיִן (“daughter of the eye”) is a second affectionate metaphor for the same spot. Together they denote the dark center of vision, the most vulnerable and instinctively protected part of the body.

Biblical usage confirms this. Deuteronomy 32:10 describes God’s care for Israel in the wilderness: “He encircled him, cared for him, guarded him as the pupil of His eye” (יִצְּרֶנְהוּ כְּאִישׁוֹן עֵינוֹ). Proverbs 7:2 urges the student, “Keep my commandments and live; and my teaching as the pupil of your eye” (וְתוֹרָתִי כְּאִישׁוֹן עֵינֶיךָ). Zechariah 2:12 warns the nations: “Whoever touches you touches the pupil of His eye” (כִּי הַנֹגֵעַ בָכֶם נֹגֵעַ בְּבָבַת עֵינוֹ). In each case, the point is extreme preciousness and vulnerability: what God guards as jealously as we guard our sight.

The second metaphor shifts scale from micro to macro: “in the shadow of Your wings” (בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ). Elsewhere in Psalms this phrase evokes both the sheltering bird and the overshadowing cherubim. Psalm 36:8: “Humans take refuge in the shadow of Your wings” (וּבְצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ יֶחֱסָיוּן). Psalm 57:2: “In the shadow of Your wings I will take refuge, until destruction passes by” (בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ אֶחֱסֶה). Psalm 91:4 mixes avian and cultic imagery: “He will cover you with His pinions, and under His wings you will take refuge” (בְּאֶבְרָתוֹ יָסֶךְ לָךְ; וְתַחַת כְּנָפָיו תֶּחְסֶה).

Radak and other medievals link the image to the cherubim whose wings overshadowed the ark: “The shadow of Your wings—that is, the wings of the cherubim.” If the psalmist is praying in or near the sanctuary, to be hidden “in the shadow of Your wings” could mean to be sheltered by the very heart of the cult.

The verb תַּסְתִּירֵנִי (“hide me”) comes from סתר (“to hide, conceal”). Psalm 31:21 uses similar language: “You hide them in the secret of Your presence from human scheming; You shelter them in a pavilion from contentious tongues” (תַּסְתִּירֵם בְּסֵתֶר פָּנֶיךָ… תִּצְפְּנֵם בְּסֻכָּה). The shelter here is not merely physical but reputational and spiritual.

In Sefardic Birkat Kohanim, as noted earlier, these phrases are put directly on the congregation’s lips: “Guard me like the pupil of the eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings.” The priestly blessing “May He guard you” is elaborated not in abstract terms, but with the psalm’s two concrete images: the fragile black point of sight, and the cool shade under outstretched wings.

**Verse 9**

מִפְּנֵי רְשָׁעִים, זוּ שַׁדּוּנִי;  
אֹיְבַי בְּנֶפֶשׁ, יַקִּיפוּ עָלָי׃  

“From before the wicked who despoil me; my enemies, with [desire for] my life, encircle me.”

The petition begun in verse 8 now names its reason: pressing human antagonists. The preposition מִפְּנֵי (“from before, from the face of”) suggests proximity: the wicked stand “in front of” him, menacingly close. The little word זוּ is unusual; here it likely functions as a relative pronoun: “those who despoil me” (שַׁדּוּנִי, from שָׁדַד, “to devastate, plunder”). The root is used of invaders stripping a land bare (Isa 33:1; Jer 4:20).

The second colon deepens the threat: “my enemies, with [my] life, encircle me.” The phrase בְּנֶפֶשׁ can mean “with their life” (i.e., wholeheartedly), but most likely here “against my life”—the same נֶפֶשׁ that God will be asked to “deliver” in verses 13 and 15. The verb יַקִּיפוּ (“encircle”) suggests a tightening ring. Elsewhere, the figurative language database notes, encircling is often a military tactic or hunting maneuver: “They prepared a net for my steps… they dug a pit before me” (Ps 57:7); “They surround me like bees” (Ps 118:12).

In certain mystical Rosh Hashanah rites (particularly those influenced by Rabbi Shalom Sharabi), this line is reinterpreted cosmically: “הַיּוֹם… בְּנֶפֶשׁ יַקִּיפוּ עָלֵינוּ לְהַשְׂטִין עָלֵינוּ—Today… they encircle us with [our] life to accuse us.” The human enemies become prosecuting angels surrounding Israel in judgment. The basic experience is the same: to be hemmed in by hostile forces with one’s very life at stake.

**Verse 10**

חֶלְבָּמוֹ סָּגְרוּ;  
פִּימוֹ דִּבְּרוּ בְגֵאוּת׃  

“Their fat they have closed up; with their mouth they speak in arrogance.”

This small verse has puzzled interpreters for centuries. Literally: “Their fat they have closed; their mouth speaks with pride.” What does it mean for fat to be “closed”?

חֵלֶב in biblical Hebrew denotes the rich fat of animals, especially the sacrificial fat that belongs to God (Lev 3:16–17), and by extension the sleekness of the well-fed. Here it serves as a metonymy for the whole prosperous body. Rashi interprets: “With their fat and sleekness they have closed their heart and their eyes from looking at Your work, to fear You.” Radak simplifies: abundance has made them complacent, and therefore they speak with pride.

The figurative-language data points us to Psalm 73, a classic meditation on the prosperous wicked. There we read: “Their eyes bulge from fatness” (יָצָא מֵחֵלֶב עֵינֵמוֹ, Ps 73:7). The grotesque image—eyes pushing out from a cushion of fat—externalizes spiritual dullness. The same psalm goes on: “Their hearts pour forth folly” (יַמִּיקוּ מִדַּבֶּר רָע, 73:8–9). In both texts, physical surfeit and arrogant speech are bound together.

The second colon sets the theme more straightforwardly: “With their mouth (פִּימוֹ) they speak in arrogance (בְּגֵאוּת).” Grammatically, the singular “their mouth” governs a plural subject (“they have closed”); Hebrew often uses such collective singulars. The noun גֵּאוּת (pride, arrogance) is elsewhere condemned: “The fear of YHWH is hatred of evil; pride and arrogance and the way of evil” (גֵּאָה וְגָאוֹן, Prov 8:13). Here it is the audible fruit of their physical and social comfort.

The coupling of closed fat and boasting mouth crystallizes a recurring biblical suspicion: too much ease can muffle empathy and loosen the tongue. Against this, the psalmist has asked to be guarded “like the pupil of the eye.”

**Verse 11**

אַשֻּׁרֵינוּ עַתָּה סְבָבוּנוּ;  
עֵינֵיהֶם יָשִׁיתוּ לִנְטוֹת בָּאָרֶץ׃  

“Our steps—they now surround us; their eyes they set to cast [us] down to the earth.”

The first colon is textually tricky. The Masoretic margin (the *Qere*, or reading tradition) has סְבָבוּנוּ (“they have surrounded *us*”), while the written text (*Ketiv*) reads סְבָבֻנִי (“they have surrounded *me*”). Radak notes both, explaining that David often speaks both as individual and as representative of his band: the enemies surround “me and my companions,” hence the oscillation between singular and plural. Either way, “our steps” (אַשֻּׁרֵינוּ) are hemmed in: the path forward is blocked.

The second colon adds a grim visual. “Their eyes they set” (עֵינֵיהֶם יָשִׁיתוּ) is a Hebrew idiom for fixing one’s gaze intently (cf. Gen 44:21, “You said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him’,” וְאָשִׂימָה עֵינִי עָלָיו). The infinitive לִנְטוֹת בָּאָרֶץ is ambiguous. The root נָטָה can mean “stretch out,” “incline,” or “turn aside”; some read it as “to spread out [nets] on the earth” (laying traps), others as “to cast [us] down to the earth”—to throw us to the ground.

Radak opts for the trap image: “They set their eyes upon our path to stretch their net on the earth to catch us.” This fits with the hunting imagery of verse 12 and with other psalms: “They prepared a net for my steps, my soul is bowed down; they dug a pit before me; they have fallen into it themselves” (Ps 57:7). Either way, the focus is on predatory intent: their gaze tracks the psalmist’s movements in order to bring him low.

Notice again the motif of eyes. God’s eyes “behold what is right” (v. 2); the psalmist is the “pupil of Your eye” (v. 8); now the enemies’ eyes look for a chance to topple him. The psalm will resolve this tug-of-war by having the psalmist himself “behold” God’s face in the end.

**Verse 12**

דִּמְיֹנוֹ כְּאַרְיֵה יִכְסוֹף לִטְרֹף;  
וְכִכְפִיר יֹשֵׁב בְּמִסְתָּרִים׃  

“His likeness is as a lion longing to tear, like a young lion sitting in hiding.”

Here the plural enemies merge into a single archetypal predator. דִּמְיֹנוֹ (“his likeness”) is a rare noun; the line could be paraphrased, “In our imagination, he is like a lion.” Traditional commentators, like Radak, see in this “he” Saul himself, but the poetic effect works regardless of historical referent: the opposition is now focused, hungrily personal.

The similes are layered. First, “as a lion longing to tear” (כְּאַרְיֵה יִכְסוֹף לִטְרֹף). The verb יִכְסוֹף, from כָּסַף, normally means to yearn or to long for (Num 11:4, “the riffraff among them craved a craving”; Gen 31:30, “you greatly longed for your father’s house”). Applied to the lion, it gives the predator an interior life: this is not mechanical hunting but craving. The object of desire is implied: the psalmist’s very self.

Second, “and like a young lion lurking in hiding” (וְכִכְפִיר יֹשֵׁב בְּמִסְתָּרִים). The כְּפִיר is a lion in its prime, agile and dangerous (cf. Job 4:10–11, “The roaring of the lion… the teeth of the young lions are broken”). The participle יֹשֵׁב (“sitting”) plus בְּמִסְתָּרִים (“in hiding places”) evokes ambush.

The figurative-language corpus confirms that lions are stock imagery for lethal enemies. Psalm 7:3 pleads, “Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces with none to deliver” (פֶּן־יִטְרֹף כְּאַרְיֵה נַפְשִׁי). Isaiah 31:4 uses the image for God’s own resolute defense of Zion: “As a lion, a young lion, growls over its prey… so YHWH of Hosts will come down to fight upon Mount Zion.” Here, the menace is human; later, the same imagery will be reversed.

By shifting from the plural “they encircle us” (v. 11) to a singular “he is like a lion,” the poet does more than vary style. He concentrates the diffuse dread of many enemies into the felt terror of one ravenous will.

**Verse 13**

קוּמָה יְהוָה; קַדְּמָה פָנָיו; הַכְרִיעֵהוּ;  
פַּלְּטָה נַפְשִׁי מֵרָשָׁע, חַרְבֶּךָ׃  

“Arise, YHWH; confront him; bring him to his knees; deliver my life from the wicked—Your sword.”

The pressure of the situation erupts into a rapid sequence of imperatives, four verbs in a row with God as subject. קוּמָה (“Arise”) is an old liturgical battle-cry; Numbers 10:35 records Moses saying, whenever the ark set out, “Arise, YHWH, and let Your enemies be scattered” (קוּמָה יְהוָה וְיָפֻצוּ אֹיְבֶיךָ). Psalm 44:27 later echoes: “Arise, be our help, and redeem us for the sake of Your steadfast love” (ק֭וּמָה עֶזְרָתָה לָּנוּ).

קַדְּמָה פָנָיו literally means “go before his face,” that is, confront him head‑on. The verb קד"ם (“to precede, meet”) suggests interception: God is asked not to trail behind the enemy but to get ahead of him. הַכְרִיעֵהוּ (“cause him to bow”) comes from a verb meaning to kneel or collapse. In military psalms it often denotes forcing enemies to the ground (cf. 2 Sam 22:40).

The final colon shifts from the enemy’s downfall to the psalmist’s preservation: “פַּלְּטָה נַפְשִׁי—snatch away my soul, my life.” The verb פלט (“to deliver, make escape”) appears often in prayers for rescue.

The phrase מֵרָשָׁע חַרְבֶּךָ is theologically charged. On one reading, it means “from the wicked [who is] Your sword”: the wicked are construed as God’s instrument of punishment, like Assyria as “the rod of My anger” (שֵׁבֶט אַפִּי, Isa 10:5). Both Rashi and Radak adopt this: “From the wicked, who is Your sword… for the sword and the escape from it are all from You.” On another reading, the word order is less compressed: “from the wicked, [from] Your sword.” Either way, the psalmist acknowledges that the same God who has allowed the enemy power (“Your sword,” “Your hand,” v. 14) must now also restrain and overcome that power.

In one memorial *El Malei Rachamim* for martyrs, this half‑verse is adapted: “פַּלְטָה נַפְשִׁי מֵרָשָׁע חַרְבֶּךָ. נְקֹם נִקְמַת דַּם עֲבָדֶיךָ—Deliver my soul from the wicked, Your sword. Avenge the blood of Your servants.” The psalm’s personal plea for deliverance becomes a judicial appeal for historical redress.

**Verse 14**

מִמְתִים יָדְךָ יְהוָה, מִמְתִים מֵחֶלֶד, חֶלְקָם בַּחַיִּים;  
וּצְפוּנְךָ תְּמַלֵּא בִטְנָם; יִשְׂבְּעוּ בָנִים; וְהִנִּיחוּ יִתְרָם לְעוֹלְלֵיהֶם׃  

“From mortals, by Your hand, O YHWH, from mortals of the world, whose portion is in this life; and [whom] Your treasure fills their belly; [who] are sated with children, and leave their surplus to their little ones.”

This verse is a knot of syntax and theology. The first half continues the plea: “from mortals, by Your hand” (מִמְתִים יָדְךָ) links back to “from the wicked—Your sword.” The plural מְתִים (literally “dead ones”) is a poetic word for mortals; the added מֵחֶלֶד likely means “of this transient world” (חֶלֶד, as in Ps 39:6). The phrase חֶלְקָם בַּחַיִּים (“their portion is in [this] life”) echoes Qohelet’s resigned joy in Ecclesiastes 9:9: “for that is your portion in life (חֶלְקְךָ בַּחַיִּים).”

The main interpretive question is whether the predicates that follow—“Your treasure fills their belly; they are sated with children; they leave their surplus to their little ones”—describe the same wicked mortals, or a new subject (“Your treasured ones”). The consonantal text reads וּצְפוּנְךָ (“Your hidden [treasure]”), but some vocalizations take it as “Your treasured [ones]” and shift the tone to blessing.

Radak and Malbim, among others, keep the focus on the wicked. On this reading, God’s own “stored-up” good (צָפוּן, as in “How great is Your goodness that You have stored up for those who fear You,” מָה־רַב טוּבְךָ אֲשֶׁר־צָפַנְתָּ לִּירֵאֶיךָ, Ps 31:20) is, ironically, filling the bellies of those who care only for this world. Job 21 paints a similar picture: “Why do the wicked live, reach old age, and grow mighty in power? Their offspring are established in their presence… They spend their days in prosperity” (Job 21:7–13).

The three clauses then form a miniature portrait of enviable domestic prosperity: full stomachs (“Your treasure fills their belly”), satisfied sons (יִשְׂבְּעוּ בָנִים), and enough to leave an “excess” (יִתְרָם) to grandchildren (עוֹלְלֵיהֶם). Within the psalm’s argument, this is not a promise but a problem. The wicked have, as it were, everything the Deuteronomic covenant seemed to offer the righteous: fertility, abundance, continuity.

The Torah Temimah records an aggadic reading that turns part of this verse in a different direction. On the phrase וּצְפוּנְךָ תְּמַלֵּא בִטְנָם (“Your hidden [thing] fill their belly”), a Talmudic saying teaches that one who places his bed on a north-south axis will merit sons, citing “Your צָפוּן fills their belly; they are sated with children” (Berakhot 5b). Here the *literal* belly becomes an arena for homiletic fertility advice; the psalm’s contrast between worldly and divine satisfaction recedes.

Within Psalm 17, however, the balance tips the other way. However enviable, this “portion in life” is explicitly limited to this חֶלֶד. The next verse will introduce a different kind of portion.

**Verse 15**

אֲנִי בְּצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ;  
אֶשְׂבְּעָה בְהָקִיץ תְּמוּנָתֶךָ׃  

“As for me, in righteousness I shall behold Your face; I will be satisfied, when I awake, with Your form.”

The psalm ends with a deliberate “as for me” (אֲנִי), an emphatic contrast to the “mortals of the world” in verse 14. *They* have their portion in this life; *I*, by contrast, have my portion in beholding God. The inclusio on צֶדֶק—“hear, O LORD, righteousness” (v. 1) and now “in righteousness I shall behold Your face”—frames righteousness as both content of petition and condition for vision.

The verb אֶחֱזֶה is, as noted, the verb of prophetic sight. Isaiah promises, “Your eyes shall behold the king in his beauty” (מֶלֶךְ בְּיָפְיוֹ תֶּחֱזֶינָה עֵינֶיךָ, Isa 33:17). Job, in his darkest hope, declares, “From my flesh I shall behold God” (וּמִבְּשָׂרִי אֶחֱזֶה אֱלוֹהַּ, Job 19:26). Our psalmist dares to expect something similar.

The objects of vision are daring: “Your face” (פָנֶיךָ) and “Your form” (תְּמוּנָתֶךָ). The noun תְּמוּנָה is rare and theologically loaded. It appears in the second commandment (“You shall not make for yourself a carved image or any likeness,” כָּל־תְּמוּנָה, Exod 20:4) and in Deuteronomy’s insistence that Israel “saw no form” at Sinai (וּתְמוּנָה אֵינְכֶם רֹאִים, Deut 4:12, 15–16). Only Moses is granted this privilege: “The form of YHWH he beholds” (וּתְמֻנַת יְהוָה יַבִּיט, Num 12:8). For the psalmist to speak of “Your תְּמוּנָה” is to place himself, rhetorically, alongside Moses.

This raises the tension with Exodus 33:20: “You cannot see My face, for no human shall see Me and live.” Traditional readings resolve it either by temporality (only after death or resurrection) or by mode (intellectual, not sensory, vision). Radak takes the eschatological path: “I am looking forward and hoping to behold Your face in the world to come.” Ibn Ezra, ever rationalist, recasts the vision as understanding: to “be satisfied… with Your form” is to have the mind filled with knowledge of God’s ways, not to see an image.

The phrase בְהָקִיץ (“when I awake”) is pivotal. It can mean waking from nightly sleep, especially if one imagines the psalmist spending the night in the temple precincts waiting for an oracle. Or it can, as Radak and later tradition suggest, allude to waking from the sleep of death, as in Daniel 12:2: “Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake” (יָקִיצוּ). The psalm’s own use of perfect verbs for God’s testing and of future for the vision leaves room for both horizons: some foretaste of God’s face in this life, consummated in a later, fuller awakening.

The final verb, אֶשְׂבְּעָה (“I will be satisfied”), answers verse 14’s “they are sated with children” (יִשְׂבְּעוּ בָנִים). Satisfaction vocabulary (שָׂבַע) often describes abundance of food or joy (Ps 22:27, “The afflicted shall eat and be satisfied”). Here it is redirected: the psalmist’s fullness comes not from grain or progeny but from contemplating God.

The sages, as we saw, connect this fullness to acts of righteousness. The Talmud in Bava Batra 10a teaches: “One who gives a coin to a poor person merits to receive the Presence of the Shekhinah, as it is said: ‘As for me, in righteousness I shall behold Your face.’” The verse becomes a promise that צדקה—doing right by the vulnerable—purifies vision.

In Sefardic *piyyutim*, notably “Bar Yochai,” the line is placed in the mouths of mystics: “בִּינָה סוֹד עוֹלָם הַבָּא שָׁמָּה… בְּצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ—Understanding, the secret of the world to come… in righteousness I shall behold Your face.” The psalm’s legal language and its vision of God thus converge in a single aspiration: to live in such a way that, whether in this world or the next, one’s deepest hunger is met not by goods but by God.
