# Editorial Assessment (College Edition) - Psalm 17

The existing introduction and commentary contain a lot of excellent material. The theological arc (from legal plea to mystical vision), the contrast between “full bellies” and “seeing God,” and the possible temple-incubation setting are all really stimulating. The writer clearly knows the traditional commentators and uses them well, and there’s good attention to Hebrew detail and to intertextual echoes (especially Numbers 12:8, Deuteronomy 4, Psalms 16/73).

For a first-year college audience, though—even one comfortable in Hebrew—the style is too dense and academic. There’s heavy use of jargon (“forensic rhetoric,” “eschatological hope,” “incubation,” “participial description”) with no quick definitions. Sentences are long and abstract, and the “why this is interesting” sometimes gets buried under piles of detail. The tone feels like a journal article more than a great class session.

A few specific issues:

- Technical terms (inclusio, participle, Hiphil, etc.) are not consistently defined.
- Some research questions raised by the macro/micro analyses (esp. v. 4 syntax, v. 14 referent, חֶלֶד) could be answered more directly and clearly.
- The liturgical section is solid but sprawling; it needs clearer structure and a few well-chosen examples rather than an exhaustive catalog.
- The verse-by-verse commentary is rich but sometimes loses the thread; it can feel more like a collection of notes than a guided reading.

Revisions needed: simplify and reorganize. Define every technical term in plain English, cut repetition, and foreground a few big through-lines: (1) courtroom + temple; (2) the eye/seeing motif; (3) the contrast between two “good lives.” Bring in the traditional and rabbinic material selectively, always explaining why a particular midrash or comment matters. Use more direct “Notice how…” teaching moves, and occasionally lighten the tone. And because the student already reads Hebrew, we can lean into Hebrew examples—but always with quick English glosses.
