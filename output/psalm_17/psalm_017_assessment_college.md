# Editorial Assessment (College Edition) - Psalm 17

The existing introduction and commentary show real depth: they know the Hebrew well, use BDB and concordances intelligently, and make excellent big-picture points (especially the contrast between v.14 and v.15, the “eye” imagery, and the chiastic structure with v.7 at the center). The discussion of *אִישׁוֹן בַּת־עָיִן* and *בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ* is particularly strong, as is the explanation of *תְּמוּנָה* in v.15.

However, for a first-year college audience, the draft is much too dense and jargon-heavy. Terms like “forensic rhetoric,” “Sitz im Leben,” “hiphil,” “chiastic,” and “eschatological” either go undefined or are defined only implicitly. Sentences are long and sometimes read like a journal article. The tone occasionally slips into breathless praise (“audacity,” “monumental text”), which tells the reader something is impressive instead of *showing* it.

Several missed opportunities:

- More explicit use of the “related psalms” data (e.g., Ps 142:6 “חֶלְקִי בְּאֶרֶץ הַחַיִּים” as a foil to Ps 17:14).
- Fuller integration of Torah Temimah and rabbinic midrash (e.g., Bava Batra 10a on 17:15; Berakhot 5 on 17:14).
- A clearer, student-friendly walk-through of v.14’s options (wicked prosperity vs. God’s provision for the righteous).
- The liturgical section is informative but not well structured for beginners; it needs headings, shorter units, more explanation of what Birkat Kohanim, Selichot, etc. actually *are*.

The verse-by-verse commentary is rich but uneven: some verses get extensive treatment, others are barely started (v.15 cuts off). The style leans heavily academic, assumes familiarity with medieval commentators, and often drops technical observations (e.g., “hiphil of פלא”) without pausing to explain.

The revision should:

- Keep the best insights but translate them into clear, conversational prose.
- Define every technical term on first use.
- Use more concrete examples and cross-references with quoted Hebrew.
- Structure both the introduction and liturgical section with clear headings.
- Make the through-line of the psalm—two competing ideas of “satisfaction”—very explicit.
