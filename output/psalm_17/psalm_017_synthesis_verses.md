# Verse-by-Verse Commentary: Psalm 17

## Verse 1

**תְּפִלָּ֗ה לְדָ֫וִ֥ד; שִׁמְעָ֤ה יְהֹוָ֨ה ׀ צֶ֗דֶק, הַקְשִׁ֥יבָה רִנָּתִ֗י, הַאֲזִ֥ינָה תְפִלָּתִ֑י, בְּ֝לֹ֗א שִׂפְתֵ֥י מִרְמָֽה׃**

*A prayer of David; Hear, O LORD, righteousness; give heed to my cry; give ear to my prayer, from lips free of deceit.*

The verse opens with a triple imperative barrage—`שִׁמְעָה` (*shim'ah*, hear), `הַקְשִׁיבָה` (*haqshivah*, give heed), `הַאֲזִינָה` (*ha'azinah*, give ear)—creating a rhetorical urgency through anaphora. This triadic structure functions as a juridical protocol: the petitioner is not merely requesting attention but *demanding* a hearing on grounds of legal right. What is most striking is the direct object of the first imperative: צֶדֶק (*tzedeq*, righteousness/justice). The psalmist does not say "hear *my plea*" or "hear *me*" but "hear *righteousness*." He so identifies his cause with abstract justice that he can command God to hear Justice itself. This is forensic confidence, not spiritual humility.

The phonetic progression intensifies the plea through stressed syllables: `shim-**ʿĀH**` → `haq-**SHIY**-vāh` → `ha-'a-**ZIY**-nāh`. Each imperative receives primary stress on its second syllable, creating a rhythmic pounding that mimics the hammering of a gavel or the insistence of a litigant demanding entry to the court. The alliteration of the sibilant *sh* sound (`shim'ah`, `haqshivah`) followed by the guttural *h* (`ha'azinah`) creates an acoustic progression from soft petition to forceful demand.

The phrase `בְּלֹא שִׂפְתֵי מִרְמָה` (*b'lo siftei mirmah*, "from lips free of deceit") functions as a moral credential. In the Mesopotamian Shu-ila prayers, the petitioner often confessed uncertainty about hidden offenses or sins of ignorance. Here, by contrast, the psalmist stakes everything on the purity of his speech. The term *mirmah* (מִרְמָה, "deceit") appears prominently in Proverbs as the antithesis of wisdom (Prov 12:5: עֲצַת רְשָׁעִים מִרְמָה, "the counsel of the wicked is deceit"). The negative formulation—"*without* deceitful lips"—employs litotes (understatement through negation) to assert positive integrity.

The liturgical tradition recognized the forensic force of this opening. In the Sefardic Selichot for the fast of the 20th of Sivan, this verse anchors a litany of appeals for divine hearing: "שְׁמַע יְהֹוָה קוֹלֵנוּ נִקְרָא חָנֵּנוּ וַעֲנֵנוּ: שִׁמְעָה יְהֹוָה צֶדֶק הַקְשִׁיבָה רִנָּתֵנוּ" ("Hear, O LORD, our voice when we call, be gracious to us and answer us: Hear, O LORD, what is right, give heed to our cry"). The community's collective petition borrows the psalmist's juridical vocabulary, transforming the individual's *tzedeq* into a communal claim on divine justice.

## Verse 2

**מִ֭לְּפָנֶיךָ מִשְׁפָּטִ֣י יֵצֵ֑א; עֵ֝ינֶ֗יךָ תֶּחֱזֶ֥ינָה מֵישָׁרִֽים׃**

*From Your presence let my judgment come forth; may Your eyes behold what is right.*

The psalmist now specifies the venue and mechanism of the desired verdict. The phrase `מִלְּפָנֶיךָ` (*millepaneikha*, "from before Your face/presence") employs the juridical idiom of standing "before" the judge—the *panim* (פָּנִים, "face") as the locus of judgment. In ancient Near Eastern iconography, the king's face was the throne of justice; to "see the king's face" (cf. 2 Sam 14:24) meant to have one's case heard. The verb יֵצֵא (*yetze'*, "let it go forth") is a legal technical term for the *pronouncement* of a verdict (cf. Num 30:3: "anything that goes forth from her mouth"—a binding oath). The psalmist is asking not merely for justice but for the *public proclamation* of his vindication, a verdict that "goes forth" from the divine tribunal into the social sphere.

The second colon shifts the metaphor from auditory (hearing in v. 1) to visual: "עֵינֶיךָ תֶּחֱזֶינָה מֵישָׁרִים" (*eineikha techezenah meisharim*, "may Your eyes behold what is upright"). The verb חָזָה (*chazah*, "to behold/perceive") is primarily used for prophetic visions or divine inspection (Num 24:4: "who sees the vision of Shaddai"). God's "eyes" are His capacity for penetrating moral vision. The term מֵישָׁרִים (*meisharim*, "uprightness/equity") shares a root with יָשָׁר (*yashar*, "straight/level"). The BDB glosses מֵישָׁרִים as "evenness, uprightness, equity"—the quality of a path that does not deviate. The psalmist is confident that God's eyes, unlike human eyes clouded by bias or bribery, will discern the *straightness* of his path when viewed from the divine perspective.

This appeal to God's vision creates a sharp contrast with human judgment. Rashi connects this to the Bathsheba incident, reading it as David's plea: "Let my judgment go forth from You, and not from the human court that condemned me." Radak interprets more generally: "Your eyes will see that the uprightness is with me and the injustice with them [the enemies]." The Ashkenazic Yom Kippur piyyut embedded in the Shacharit Kedushah quotes the second half of this verse in a sequence of pleas for divine perception: "עֲקֶֽרֶת בַּֽיִת וַחֲצוּבַת צוּרִים. עֵינֶֽיךָ תֶּחֱזֶֽינָה מֵישָׁרִים: וְיִזָּכֵר לְפָנֶֽיךָ צִדְקַת הַתָּם" ("...may Your eyes behold what is right, and may the righteousness of the pure one be remembered before You"). The liturgical context transforms the personal appeal into a communal hope that God's gaze, which penetrates beyond appearances, will vindicate the covenant people.

## Verse 3

**בָּ֘חַ֤נְתָּ לִבִּ֨י ׀ פָּ֘קַ֤דְתָּ לַּ֗יְלָה, צְרַפְתַּ֥נִי בַל־תִּמְצָ֑א; זַ֝מֹּתִ֗י בַּל־יַעֲבׇר־פִּֽי׃**

*You have tested my heart, You have visited me by night; You have tried me and found nothing; I have resolved that my mouth shall not transgress.*

The verse presents a triple divine scrutiny—בָּחַנְתָּ (*bachanta*, "You have tested"), פָּקַדְתָּ (*pakadta*, "You have visited"), צְרַפְתַּנִי (*tzaraftani*, "You have refined me")—each verb escalating in metallurgical intensity. The root בָּחַן (*bachan*) means to examine or assay ore (Jer 6:27: "I have made you an assayer among My people"). The root פָּקַד (*pakad*) has a semantic range including "to visit, attend to, inspect" and is used for military musters (Num 1:3) and divine accounting (Gen 50:24: "God will surely visit you"). Here, the "night visit" suggests an unannounced inspection when masks fall and the heart's true contents emerge. The root צָרַף (*tzaraf*) is the technical term for smelting silver in a crucible to remove dross (Mal 3:3: "He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver"). The progression is from passive examination (looking at ore) to active investigation (visiting the mine) to intense purification (melting in fire).

The result of this triple ordeal is the emphatic בַל־תִּמְצָא (*bal-timtza*, "You found nothing"). The particle בַּל (*bal*) is a strong negative, used primarily in poetry for categorical denial. The triple use of בַּל (three times in two cola) creates a rhetorical drumbeat of innocence. The psalmist is not claiming he has *no* sin, but that under divine inspection, no *zimmah* (זַמֹּתִי, "scheme/evil plan")—no premeditated malice—was discovered. The term *zimmah* denotes calculated wickedness (Lev 18:17: sexual depravity; Prov 21:27: sacrifices offered with *zimmah*). The final colon, "זַמֹּתִי בַּל־יַעֲבׇר־פִּי" (*zimmoti bal-ya'avor-pi*, "I have purposed that my mouth shall not transgress"), closes with a vow of speech-integrity that mirrors the opening claim of verse 1 ("lips without deceit").

Rashi reads this night-visitation through the lens of the Bathsheba narrative: "You visited me at eventide for the iniquity of Bathsheba... and You found me returning in repentance." He transforms the psalm into a post-facto confession. Malbim, by contrast, reads it as a claim of sustained innocence: "In the night, which is the time of [evil] thoughts and meditations, You visited me... and found I did not harbor thoughts that were unfit even to utter." The Midrash Tehillim applies it to the Akedah: "You tested my heart—this is the binding of Isaac." The tradition thus oscillates between reading this as moral confidence (Malbim) and as post-repentance restoration (Rashi).

The liturgical reception underscores the temple incubation hypothesis. The Edot HaMizrach tradition recites the full psalm on Yom Kippur Shacharit during the expanded Pesukei Dezimra, a context where the "night visitation" resonates with the vigil practices of the Day of Atonement. The night becomes the time of divine moral inventory, when the ledgers are inspected and the verdict prepared.

## Verse 4

**לִפְעֻלּ֣וֹת אָ֭דָם בִּדְבַ֣ר שְׂפָתֶ֑יךָ, אֲנִ֥י שָׁ֝מַ֗רְתִּי אׇרְח֥וֹת פָּרִֽיץ׃**

*As for the doings of man, by the word of Your lips, I have kept [from] the paths of the violent.*

This verse is syntactically notorious, exhibiting a roughness that has led to multiple interpretive traditions. The phrase לִפְעֻלּוֹת אָדָם (*liph'ulot adam*, "as for the doings/works of man") lacks a governing verb and has prompted emendations. The syntax is elliptical, forcing the reader to supply the logical connection. Ibn Ezra parses it: "בעבור היותי אוהבך לפעולות אדם"—"Because of my love for You, as for human actions [that You command]..." He reads it as a statement of motivation: *because of Your commands*, I have kept from the violent path. Radak reads it adversely: "I have acted like the wicked," taking the verse as a confession of having *walked* in the violent path, not avoided it. This minoritarian reading makes the entire psalm a penitential lament rather than a protestation of innocence.

The majority reading, however, supported by the MT's vocalization and the parallel in Psalm 18:23 ("All His ordinances were before me, and His statutes I did not put away from me"), construes the verse as: "In matters of human conduct, *according to the word of Your lips* [=Torah], I have kept *away from* the paths of the violent." The term אׇרְחוֹת פָּרִיץ (*orchot paritz*, "paths of the violent/robber") employs the metaphor of "path" (אֹרַח/*orach*) common to Wisdom literature. The word פָּרִיץ (*paritz*) denotes the outlaw or the one who "breaks through" social norms (Jer 7:11: "a den of robbers," מְעָרַת פָּרִיצִים/*me'arat paritzim*). The BDB notes it as one who acts with violence or lawlessness, related to the verb פָּרַץ (*paratz*, "to break/burst through").

The phrase בִּדְבַ֣ר שְׂפָתֶ֑יךָ (*bidvar sefatekha*, "by the word of Your lips") is a technical designation for divine revelation, equivalent to Torah. It appears in Deuteronomy 8:3: "Man does not live by bread alone, but by everything that goes forth from the mouth of the LORD" (בְּכֹל־מוֹצָא פִי־יְהוָה). The psalmist claims that his ethical standard is not social convention ("the doings of man") but the transcendent norm of God's revealed word. This creates a pointed contrast with the "men of the world" (מִמְתִים מֵחֶלֶד, v. 14), whose horizon is purely horizontal.

The Davidic superscription and historical setting illuminate the verse. In 1 Samuel 24:7, when David's men urge him to kill Saul in the cave at En-gedi, saying "This is the day of which the LORD said to you, 'I will deliver your enemy into your hand,'" David refuses, declaring: "The LORD forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, the LORD's anointed, to stretch out my hand against him, for he is the LORD's anointed." The "paths of the violent"—the pragmatic, revolutionary option of assassination—are precisely what David rejected "by the word of Your lips" (the command not to touch the anointed). Malbim makes this connection explicit: "I guarded against doing any forbidden thing, as the violent do." The verse thus functions as a theological commentary on David's restraint, asserting that covenantal ethics must constrain even legitimate political self-interest.

## Verse 5

**תָּמֹךְ֮ אֲשֻׁרַ֢י בְּמַעְגְּלוֹ֫תֶ֥יךָ; בַּל־נָמ֥וֹטּוּ פְעָמָֽי׃**

*My steps held fast to Your tracks; my feet did not slip.*

The metaphor of the divine "tracks" (מַעְגְּלוֹת/*ma'g'lotekha*) is rare and evocative. The root עָגַל (*'agal*) refers to the circular rut made by a wagon wheel (hence עֲגָלָה/*'agalah*, "cart"). The מַעְגָּל (*ma'gal*) is thus the well-worn path created by repeated travel, the groove in the road that guides the wheel. Proverbs 4:26 uses the term in moral exhortation: "פַּלֵּס מַעְגַּל רַגְלֶךָ" (*pales ma'gal raglekha*, "make level the path of your foot"). The psalmist claims to have kept his steps *in* the divinely cut ruts, following the pre-established course rather than veering into the unmarked wilderness.

The verb תָּמֹךְ (*tamokh*, "held fast/supported") can be parsed as either a perfect (indicative: "held fast") or an imperative (jussive: "hold fast!"). The MT vocalization with the qametz under the tav suggests a perfect, but manuscripts vary. If read as indicative, it parallels verse 3's claim of accomplished integrity; if imperative, it modulates into petition. Radak offers both readings: "תָּמֹךְ is an infinitive in place of an imperative, as in 'Keep (שָׁמוֹר) the Sabbath day' (Deut 5:12)... Or it can mean: I maintained my steps in Your paths." The ambiguity is theologically rich: even in asserting human agency ("I held fast"), the psalmist acknowledges that such steadfastness is itself a divine gift requiring the jussive plea ("Maintain [my steps]!").

The second colon employs the standard biblical metaphor of "not slipping" (בַּל־נָמ֥וֹטּוּ/*bal-namottu*) as moral steadfastness. The root מוּט (*mut*, "to totter/slip") appears throughout Psalms as the contrast to stability (Ps 16:8: "I shall not be moved," בַל־אֶמּוֹט/*bal-emot*; Ps 121:3: "He will not let your foot slip," אַל־יִתֵּן לַמּוֹט רַגְלֶךָ/*al-yitten lamot raglekha*). The foot's slipping is the moment of moral collapse, the transition from righteousness to sin. Job 12:5 uses the image pejoratively: "He who is about to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised" (נָכוֹן לַמּוֹעֵד רַגֶל/*nakhon lamo'ed ragel*). The psalmist's claim "my feet did not slip" (בַּל־נָמוֹטּוּ פְעָמָי) is thus a claim to sustained moral orientation.

Malbim introduces a subtle distinction between *orach* (אֹרַח, straight path) and *ma'gal* (מַעְגָּל, circular path). He notes that sometimes one must "detour" (נוטה/*noteh*) from the straight path of mercy to the "circular path" of severity—as when punishing evildoers or executing justice. He writes: "The *ma'gal* is the circular path, where sometimes one must turn from the straight path (*orach*) to the roundabout route (*ma'gal*) that circles until it returns to the straight path. For example, mercy is the straight path, as are humility and modesty; but sometimes one must turn to cruelty and pride and boldness against the wicked... and for this one needs God's help לבל יטה מני הדרך ('lest he stray from the path')." This remarkable exegesis transforms the verse into a meditation on *contextual ethics*—the need for divine guidance precisely when the straight path is *not* the right one.

## Verse 6

**אֲנִֽי־קְרָאתִ֣יךָ כִֽי־תַעֲנֵ֣נִי אֵ֑ל; הַֽט־אׇזְנְךָ֥ לִ֝֗י, שְׁמַ֣ע אִמְרָתִֽי׃**

*I call upon You, for You will answer me, O God; incline Your ear to me, hear my word.*

The verse pivots from past protestation (vv. 3-5) to present petition with a striking confidence formula: כִּי־תַעֲנֵנִי (*ki-ta'aneni*, "for You will answer me"). The causal particle כִּי (*ki*) asserts certainty, not hope. This is not "I call in the hope that You might answer" but "I call *because I know* You will answer." Rashi glosses: "כי בטוח אני שתענני"—"for I am confident that You will answer me." The perfect-imperfect sequence (קָרָאתִיךָ/*karatikha*, "I have called" → תַעֲנֵנִי/*ta'aneni*, "You will answer") posits the divine response as the inevitable consequence of the covenantal relationship.

The vocative אֵל (*el*, "God") is more intimate than the tetragrammaton (יהוה). It emphasizes divine power (from אַיִל/*ayil*, "strength") while functioning as a personal address. The shift from יהוה in verses 1-2 to אֵל here signals a modulation from the formal, covenantal name to a relational, almost paternal invocation. This choice may reflect the influence of patriarchal narratives where God is אֵל שַׁדַּי (*El Shaddai*, Gen 17:1) or אֵל עֶלְיוֹן (*El Elyon*, Gen 14:18-20).

The imperative הַט־אׇזְנְךָ (*hat-oznekha*, "incline Your ear") employs a physiological metaphor: the ear as a directional organ that must be *tilted* toward the sound source. This idiom appears frequently in lament psalms (Ps 31:3: "הַטֵּה אֵלַי אׇזְנְךָ"/*hateh elai oznekha*, "incline to me Your ear"; Ps 71:2: "הַטֵּה אֵלַי אׇזְנְךָ וְהוֹשִׁיעֵנִי"/*hateh elai oznekha v'hoshi'eni*, "incline to me Your ear and save me"). The gesture suggests that God is "standing upright" in transcendence and must *bend down* to hear the prayer rising from below. This anthropomorphic image simultaneously affirms divine sovereignty (God's upright posture) and divine condescension (God's willingness to stoop).

The final imperative, שְׁמַע אִמְרָתִי (*shema imrati*, "hear my word"), employs the root שָׁמַע (*shama'*), which dominates the opening of the psalm (v. 1: שִׁמְעָה). The object, אִמְרָתִי (*imrati*, "my word/utterance"), is singular and emphatic. The BDB notes that אִמְרָה (*imrah*) often refers to a "speech" or "utterance" with authority—sometimes God's word (Ps 119:11: "Your word [אִמְרָתְךָ/*imratekha*] have I treasured in my heart"), sometimes a human declaration. The psalmist's *imrah* is presented not as a babbling petition but as a *statement* deserving legal attention.

Meiri comments: "After clarifying his repentance, he now begins his prayer, saying: I have called to You because I trust that You will answer me; incline Your ear to me, accept my prayer." The sequence—protestation of innocence (vv. 3-5) followed by confident petition (v. 6)—models the structure of Ancient Near Eastern legal appeals, where the accused first establishes his credibility before presenting his request. The liturgical use of this verse in various Selichot contexts transforms the individual confidence formula into a communal hope, the congregation standing with David in the certainty that their collective cry will not return void.

## Verse 7

**הַפְלֵ֣ה חֲ֭סָדֶיךָ מוֹשִׁ֣יעַ חוֹסִ֑ים; מִ֝מִּתְקוֹמְמִ֗ים בִּֽימִינֶֽךָ׃**

*Make wondrous Your steadfast love, O Savior of those who take refuge; from those who rise up, by Your right hand.*

The imperative הַפְלֵה (*hafleh*, "make wondrous/set apart") is the hiphil of פָּלָא (*pala'*), the root denoting the miraculous and the extraordinary. This same verbal form appears in the Exodus narrative when God promises to "set apart" (וְהִפְלֵיתִי/*v'hifleti*) the land of Goshen from the plagues afflicting Egypt (Exod 8:18: "On that day I will set apart the land of Goshen..."). The BDB glosses the hiphil as "to make wonderful, do wonders, separate by an extraordinary act." The psalmist is not requesting routine favor but a *dramatic, visible distinction*—a plague-like demarcation between the righteous and the wicked.

The object of this "wondrous separation" is חֲסָדֶיךָ (*chasadekha*, "Your steadfast love/covenant loyalty"). The term חֶסֶד (*chesed*) is the covenantal keyword, denoting the binding love that arises from treaty obligation. It is not spontaneous emotion but *committed loyalty*. The plural form (חֲסָדִים/*chasadim*) emphasizes the multiplicity of God's acts of faithfulness. The psalmist asks God to *display* His *chesed* in a way that makes it *apparent* to all observers—to "set it apart" so that friend and foe alike can see it operating. This request for public demonstration of divine favor stands in sharp contrast to the hidden justice of human courts, which often leaves the verdict ambiguous.

The phrase מוֹשִׁיעַ חוֹסִים (*moshi'a chosim*, "Savior of those who take refuge") employs a participial construction that functions as a divine epithet. The verb יָשַׁע (*yasha'*, "to save/deliver") is the root of the name יְהוֹשֻׁעַ (*Yehoshua*, Joshua/Jesus: "YHWH saves"). The participle מוֹשִׁיעַ (*moshi'a*, "Savior") identifies God's essential character as the one who saves those who חָסָה (*chasah*, "take refuge") in Him. This refuge-seeking is a deliberate act of political and spiritual allegiance. In the ancient world, to "take refuge" (חָסָה) meant to flee to a sanctuary or to place oneself under the protection of a suzerain. Psalm 2:12 concludes with the beatitude: "Happy are all who take refuge in Him" (אַשְׁרֵי כׇּל־חוֹסֵי בוֹ/*ashrei kol-chosei vo*). The refuge-takers are those who have renounced other protectors and cast their lot entirely with YHWH.

The final phrase, מִמִּתְקוֹמְמִים בִּימִינֶךָ (*mimmitkomomim bim'inekha*, "from those who rise up, by Your right hand"), is syntactically compressed. The participle מִתְקוֹמְמִים (*mitkomomim*, "those who rise up/rebels") is from the hitpael of קוּם (*qum*, "to arise"), suggesting active, hostile rebellion. The phrase בִּימִינֶךָ (*bim'inekha*, "by Your right hand") is ambiguous: it could mean "save *by* Your right hand" (instrumental) or "[save from] those who rise up *against* Your right hand" (adversarial). Ibn Ezra reads it as "[save from] those who rise up by [claiming to act by] Your right hand"—i.e., those who falsely claim divine sanction for their violence. This reading transforms the enemies from garden-variety oppressors into theocratic hypocrites, those who weaponize God's name to justify their cruelty.

Malbim offers a psychological reading: "You, the God who saves refuge-seekers, must make Your *chesed* extraordinary, because of these who rise up *by Your right hand*—meaning, they show themselves as if they are righteous and rise up against me with Your help, and they say that Your right hand will save them against me, as David's enemies said: 'God has forsaken him, pursue' (Ps 71:11)... Therefore You must *set apart* Your *chesed* to show that the truth is not with them." In this interpretation, the crisis is not mere persecution but the enemy's successful *appropriation of divine legitimacy*. The wicked claim to be God's instruments, and only a wondrous act can expose the lie.

The liturgical tradition seized on this verse as a centerpiece of protective prayer. In the Edot HaMizrach Rosh Hashanah liturgy (Seder Tekiat Shofar), the verse is recited in a reordered sequence that first describes the enemy (v. 12: "like a lion eager to tear") and then pleads: "הַפְלֵה חֲסָדֶיךָ מוֹשִׁיעַ חוֹסִים מִמִּתְקוֹמְמִים בִּימִינֶךָ. שָׁמְרֵנִי כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת עָיִן בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנִי" ("Make wondrous Your steadfast love, O Savior of those who take refuge, from those who rise up, by Your right hand. Guard me as the apple of Your eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings"). The juxtaposition of the lion-enemy with the plea for wondrous *chesed* creates a liturgical theology where the Day of Judgment becomes the moment of *hafla'ah*—the wondrous separation of the saved from the condemned.

In the Nisan Yehi Ratzon (recited during the first twelve days of Nisan as part of the Korban Nesi'im readings), the verse is embedded in a catena of protection texts: "קוּמָה עֶזְרָתָה לָּנוּ וּפְדֵנוּ לְמַעַן חַסְדֶּךָ. הַפְלֵה חֲסָדֶיךָ מוֹשִׁיעַ חוֹסִים מִמִּתְקוֹמְמִים בִּימִינֶךָ. יְהִי־חַסְדְּךָ יְהֹוָה עָלֵינוּ כַּאֲשֶׁר יִחַלְנוּ לָךְ" ("Arise as our help and redeem us for the sake of Your *chesed*. Make wondrous Your steadfast love, O Savior of those who take refuge, from those who rise up by Your right hand. Let Your steadfast love be upon us, O LORD, as we wait for You"). The linking of חֶסֶד (*chesed*) from multiple psalms (44:27, 17:7, 33:22) creates a liturgical theology where covenantal loyalty is not a static attribute but a performative divine act that must be invoked and displayed.

## Verse 8

**שׇׁ֭מְרֵנִי כְּאִישׁ֣וֹן בַּת־עָ֑יִן; בְּצֵ֥ל כְּ֝נָפֶ֗יךָ תַּסְתִּירֵֽנִי׃**

*Guard me as the apple of the eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings.*

This verse presents two of the most memorable protective metaphors in all of Scripture, each operating at a different scale. The first, כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת־עָיִן (*k'ishon bat-ayin*, "as the apple of the eye"), employs a complex anatomical idiom. The word אִישׁוֹן (*ishon*) is the diminutive of אִישׁ (*ish*, "man"), formed with the diminutive suffix -וֹן. It refers to the "little man"—the tiny reflection of oneself visible in another's pupil. The BDB notes: "The diminutive *ishon* (lit. 'little man') is the pupil, the image in the eye." This is not merely the eye *in general* but specifically the *pupil*, the dark center through which light enters and vision occurs. The phrase בַּת־עַיִן (*bat-ayin*, "daughter of the eye") is a parallel idiom for the same anatomical feature, using the genitive relationship ("daughter of...") to denote the most precious, guarded component. The juxtaposition of the "little man" with the "daughter" creates a double diminutive that emphasizes extreme fragility and preciousness.

This idiom appears in Deuteronomy 32:10, where God finds Jacob in the wilderness and "guards him as the apple of His eye" (יִצְּרֶנְהוּ כְּאִישׁוֹן עֵינוֹ/*yitzrenhu k'ishon eino*). Proverbs 7:2 commands: "Keep my commandments and live, and my teaching as the apple of your eye" (וְתוֹרָתִי כְּאִישׁוֹן עֵינֶיךָ/*v'torati k'ishon einekha*). Zechariah 2:8 employs it in a shocking political theology: "For thus said the LORD of Hosts... he who touches you touches the apple of His eye" (כִּי הַנֹּגֵעַ בָּכֶם נֹגֵעַ בְּבָבַת עֵינוֹ/*ki hanogea bakhem nogea b'vavat eino*). The metaphor establishes a reflexive relationship: to harm the protected is to injure the Protector's own organ of vision. The psalmist is asking to be positioned at the *center* of God's gaze, where any threat to him is experienced by God as an assault on His own faculty of sight.

The second metaphor, בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנִי (*b'tzel kenafekha tastiyreni*, "hide me in the shadow of Your wings"), operates at the macroscopic scale. The term צֵל (*tzel*, "shadow") denotes the area of darkness cast by an opaque object blocking light. To dwell in someone's "shadow" (צֵל) is to be sheltered under their protective canopy. The phrase כְּנָפַיִם (*kenafayim*, "wings") is deliberately ambiguous, inviting both ornithological and architectural readings. On one level, it evokes the maternal imagery of a mother bird sheltering her chicks (cf. Deut 32:11: "Like an eagle that stirs up its nest, hovers over its young, spreads its wings, takes them, carries them on its pinions"). On another level, and more likely in the cultic context of the psalm, it refers to the כְּרוּבִים (*keruvim*, cherubim) whose wings overshadow the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy of Holies (Exod 25:20: "The cherubim shall spread out their wings above, overshadowing [סֹכְכִים/*sokh'khim*] the cover with their wings").

This dual reading is supported by the concordance data. Psalm 36:8 uses the same phrase in a clearly cultic context: "How precious is Your steadfast love, O God! The children of men take refuge in the shadow of Your wings" (וּבְנֵי אָדָם בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ יֶחֱסָיוּן/*uvnei adam b'tzel kenafekha yechasayun*). Psalm 57:2, composed (per its superscription) when David fled from Saul into a cave, employs the metaphor explicitly as sanctuary: "I will take refuge in the shadow of Your wings until the disaster has passed" (בְּצֵל־כְּנָפֶיךָ אֶחְסֶה עַד יַעֲבֹר הַוּוֹת/*b'tzel-kenafekha echseh ad ya'avor havvot*). Psalm 63:8, composed "when he was in the Wilderness of Judah," declares: "For You have been my help, and in the shadow of Your wings I shout for joy" (וּבְצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ אֲרַנֵּן/*uvtzel kenafekha aranen*). The pattern is clear: the "shadow of wings" is the sanctuary, the place where the hunted fugitive finds asylum from the blood-avenger.

The verb תַּסְתִּירֵנִי (*tastiyreni*, "hide me") is from the root סָתַר (*satar*, "to hide/conceal"), used for both physical hiding (1 Sam 19:2: "Hide yourself," וְהִסְתַּתַּרְתָּ/*v'histatarta*) and divine protection (Ps 27:5: "He will hide me in His pavilion," יַסְתִּרֵנִי בְּסֻכֹּה/*yastireni b'sukkoh*; Ps 31:21: "You hide them in the secret of Your presence," תַּסְתִּירֵם בְּסֵתֶר פָּנֶיךָ/*tastiyrem b'seter panekha*). The imperative form demands action: "Act now to conceal me!"

The juxtaposition of the microscopic (pupil) and the macroscopic (wings) creates a totalizing image of protection. The psalmist is asking to be both the *focus* of divine attention (the center of the pupil) and the *object* of divine sheltering (under the wingspan). Nothing could be more intimate (the pupil) or more encompassing (the wing). The two metaphors together establish the petitioner as simultaneously *seen* (by the eye) and *hidden* (under the wing)—a paradox that resolves in the sanctuary, where one is hidden *from enemies* but fully visible *to God*.

The liturgical reception of this verse is extraordinary. In the Sefardic Seder Birkat Kohanim, when the Kohanim chant the word וְיִשְׁמְרֶךָ (*v'yishmerekha*, "and may He guard you") from Numbers 6:24, the congregation responds with the full verse: "שָׁמְרֵנִי כְּאִשׁוֹן בַּת עָיִן בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנִי" ("Guard me as the apple of Your eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings"). This creates a liturgical dialogue where the priestly blessing becomes the cue for the congregation to *specify* the mode of protection they desire. The blessing's generic "guard you" is filled with the psalmist's concrete imagery.

In the Edot HaMizrach Seudah Revi'it (Fourth Meal) introduction, recited as the extra soul (נְשָׁמָה יְתֵרָה/*neshamah yeterah*) of Shabbat departs, the verse anchors a plea for continued protection into the workweek: "בְּכֹחַ סְגֻלָּתָהּ שָׁמְרֵנוּ כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת עָיִן, וּבְצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנוּ" ("By the power of its [Shabbat's] virtue, guard us like the apple of the eye; hide us in the shadow of Your wings"). The "shadow of wings" thus becomes the *extension* of Shabbat's holiness into the profane time of the week. What was spatially located in the sanctuary (the wings of the cherubim) and temporally located in the Shabbat (the canopy of sacred time) is now invoked as a permanent, portable protection.

Malbim, characteristically, distinguishes the two metaphors functionally: "Guard me like the apple of the eye from the wicked who *plunder this* [הַזּוֹ שַׁדּוּנִי, *hazu shadduni*, v. 9], who rob me of the apple of the eye... as if they blind my eyes, meaning they want to turn me from the path of light to the path of darkness. Therefore, guard my soul and the apple of my eye with special watchfulness, as God set many protections for the apple of the eye, since it is a delicate and subtle part... And *hide me in the shadow of Your wings* from *my enemies with the soul*, who pursue me to kill me, who hunt my body to destroy it." Malbim's exegesis transforms the two threats into distinct categories: intellectual-spiritual enemies (who blind) versus physical enemies (who kill), with the eye and the wing providing appropriate, categorically matched defenses.

## Verse 9

**מִפְּנֵ֣י רְ֭שָׁעִים ז֣וּ שַׁדּ֑וּנִי; אֹיְבַ֥י בְּ֝נֶ֗פֶשׁ יַקִּ֥יפוּ עָלָֽי׃**

*From the face of the wicked who despoil me; my deadly enemies who encircle me.*

The verse shifts from petition (v. 8) to description of the threat. The phrase מִפְּנֵי רְשָׁעִים (*mippenei resha'im*, "from the face of the wicked") employs the preposition מִפְּנֵי (*mippenei*), which can mean "from before/away from" (spatial) or "because of" (causal). The BDB notes both usages. Here, the context suggests the spatial: the psalmist seeks to be hidden (v. 8: תַּסְתִּירֵנִי/*tastiyreni*) *away from* the direct gaze or presence (פָּנִים/*panim*) of the wicked. The term רְשָׁעִים (*resha'im*, "wicked ones") is the standard designation for covenant-breakers, those who act in opposition to *tzedeq* (righteousness). They are not merely "sinners" (חַטָּאִים/*chatta'im*) who err, but deliberate rejecters of the divine order.

The phrase ז֣וּ שַׁדּ֑וּנִי (*zu shadduni*) is grammatically puzzling and has occasioned much debate. The particle ז֣וּ (*zu*) is rare, appearing elsewhere only in Psalms 12:8, 31:5, 62:12, 68:29, and Isaiah 42:24. Grammarians have proposed multiple readings: (1) a demonstrative pronoun, "these who despoil me" (so Rashi: "בשביל זאת ששודדים אותי," "because of this, that they rob me"); (2) a relative pronoun equivalent to אֲשֶׁר (*asher*), "who despoil me" (so Radak: "מלת זו כענין אשר," "the word *zu* is like *asher*"); or (3) an adverbial intensifier, "indeed they despoil me." The verb שָׁדַד (*shadad*, "to despoil/devastate") is the term for violent plundering, often used in military contexts (Isa 21:2: "The plunderer plunders," בּוֹגֵד בּוֹגֵד וְשׁוֹדֵד שׁוֹדֵד/*boged boged v'shoded shoded*; Jer 6:26: "the destroyer comes upon us," שֹׁדֵד בָּא עָלֵינוּ/*shoded ba aleinu*). The enemies are not merely hostile; they are engaged in active, violent dispossession.

The second colon introduces a new metaphor: אֹיְבַי בְּנֶפֶשׁ יַקִּיפוּ עָלָי (*oyvai b'nefesh yakifu alai*, "my enemies with the soul encircle me"). The phrase בְּנֶפֶשׁ (*b'nefesh*, "with the soul") functions as an intensifying idiom, meaning "with deadly intent" or "to the death." The BDB notes this usage: "with desire, appetite, especially for food or drink, but also of other desires or purposes." Here, the "appetite" is for the psalmist's destruction. The verb יַקִּיפוּ (*yakifu*, "they encircle") is from נָקַף (*naqaf*, "to surround/encircle"), used in military contexts for siege warfare (Josh 6:3: "You shall march around [וְסַבֹּתֶם, *v'sabbotem*] the city"; 2 Kings 6:14: "They came by night and surrounded [וַיַּקִּפוּ, *vayyakifu*] the city").

The shift from the singular "who despoils *me*" (שַׁדּוּנִי/*shadduni*, first-person singular object suffix) to the plural "my *enemies*" (אֹיְבַי/*oyvai*) and back to the singular "upon *me*" (עָלָי/*alai*) creates a grammatical oscillation that reflects the psalmist's psychological state: the threat is both singular (a specific persecutor) and plural (a hostile collective). This mirrors the pattern in 1 Samuel 23-26, where David is hunted by Saul (singular enemy) but surrounded by Saul's army (plural enemies).

Meiri reads the verse with subtle theological precision: "From the wicked who *therefore* [זוּ, *zu*] despoil me, meaning, it is because of [the wicked] that I am despoiled, and they are my enemies בְּנֶפֶשׁ (*b'nefesh*), meaning with great desire and appetite they come to encircle me to deliver me into the hand of my enemy." The phrase בְּנֶפֶשׁ is thus read as expressing the *fervor* of the enemies' pursuit—they hunt not dispassionately but with a visceral craving for his downfall.

The imagery of encirclement (יַקִּיפוּ/*yakifu*) introduces a key spatial metaphor that will intensify in verse 11 (סְבָבוּנוּ/*s'vavunu*, "they surround us"). The psalmist is not merely opposed; he is *surrounded*, cut off from escape routes. This siege language evokes both military and predatory imagery (the lion circling prey, v. 12), establishing the psalmist's existential vulnerability. The liturgical use of this verse is limited but significant. In the Edot HaMizrach Yom Kippur Shacharit, where the full psalm is recited, this verse marks the transition from petition (vv. 6-8) to complaint (vv. 9-12), shifting the tone from the intimate protection imagery of the "apple of the eye" to the harsh reality of hostile encirclement.

## Verse 10

**חֶלְבָּ֥מוֹ סָּגְר֑וּ; פִּ֝֗ימוֹ דִּבְּר֥וּ בְגֵאֽוּת׃**

*They have closed their fat; their mouth speaks arrogantly.*

This verse presents one of the most debated textual cruces in the psalm. The phrase חֶלְבָּמוֹ סָּגְרוּ (*chelbamo sagru*, "they have closed their fat") is grammatically and semantically perplexing. The term חֵלֶב (*chelev*, "fat") in biblical physiology refers to the suet or fatty tissue surrounding internal organs, particularly the heart and kidneys. In sacrificial contexts, this fat is the portion reserved for God (Lev 3:16: "All fat is the LORD's," כׇּל־חֵלֶב לַיהוָה/*kol-chelev la-Adonai*). In anthropological contexts, it can denote the "heart" or the seat of emotions (cf. Ps 73:7, where the wicked's sins "overflow from their fat," יָצָא מֵחֵלֶב עֵינֵמוֹ/*yatza mei-chelev einemo*—though the MT there is often emended). The verb סָגַר (*sagar*, "to shut/close") is used for closing doors (Gen 19:10), shutting up prisoners (Jer 32:2), or sealing a womb (Gen 20:18: "The LORD had closed fast every womb," עָצֹר עָצַר יְהוָה בְּעַד כׇּל־רֶחֶם/*'atsor 'atzar Adonai be'ad kol-rechem*).

The critical question: what does it mean to "close the fat"? Rashi glosses: "בְּחֶלְבָּם וּבְשֻׁמָּנָם סָגְרוּ לִבָּם... מֵהַבִּיט אֶל פָּעֳלְךָ" ("With their fat and their fatness they have closed their heart... from looking at Your works"). He reads *chelev* as a metonym for the "gross, insensate heart." Ibn Ezra suggests emending חֶלְבָּמוֹ (*chelbamo*, "their fat") to לִבָּם (*libbam*, "their heart"): "חלבמו סגרו פימו—their heart is shut, their mouth speaks." This emendation is attractive paleographically (חלב and לב differ by only one letter) and appears in some LXX manuscripts, which read ἡ καρδία αὐτῶν (*hē kardia autōn*, "their heart"). However, the MT's "fat" is preserved in most witnesses and should not be lightly dismissed.

Radak offers a socio-economic reading: "רֹב שֻׁמָּנָם סָגַר פִּיהֶם, עַל כֵּן דִּבְּרוּ בְגֵאוּת" ("The abundance of their fatness closed their mouth [=made them proud], therefore they spoke arrogantly"). He links *chelev* to material prosperity: the rich "close" themselves off in their abundance, becoming impervious to the needs of others. This reading finds support in Job 15:27, where the wicked man "covers his face with his fat" (כִּי־כִסָּה פָנָיו בְּחֶלְבּוֹ/*ki-kissah fanav b'chelbo*), a metaphor for the blindness induced by wealth.

Metzudat David synthesizes: "מֵרֹב חֶלְבָּם סָגְרוּ פִּיהֶם מִגֹּדֶל הַשֹּׁמֶן... לְזֶה יְדַבְּרוּ בְגָאוּת" ("From the abundance of their fat they closed their mouth from the greatness of the fat... therefore they speak in arrogance"). He reads the "closing" as the physical obstruction caused by obesity, a literalization of the metaphor. Meiri, however, reads it psychologically: "לְרֹב חֶלְבָּם וְשֻׁמָּנָם סָגְרוּ פִּיהֶם מֵרֹב גַּאֲוָה, וְהוּא עִנְיָן דִּבְּרוּ בְגֵאוּת" ("From the abundance of their fat and fatness they closed their mouth from abundant pride, and this is the sense of 'they spoke in arrogance'"). The "closing" is thus the *sealing* of compassion, the shutting off of the moral faculty.

The most compelling interpretation recognizes *chelev* as an idiomatic reference to the insensate heart. To "close the fat" is to render oneself callous, to seal off the emotional core so that no external plight can penetrate. This reading is supported by the parallel in Psalm 73:7: "Their eyes bulge from fat; the imaginations of their heart overflow" (יָצָא מֵחֵלֶב עֵינֵמוֹ עָבְרוּ מַשְׂכִּיּוֹת לֵבָב/*yatza mei-chelev einemo 'avru maskiyyot levav*). The *chelev* is the cushion of moral insulation that allows the wicked to speak בְגֵאוּת (*b'ge'ut*, "in pride/arrogance") without compunction.

The second colon, פִּימוֹ דִּבְּרוּ בְגֵאוּת (*pimo dibberu v'ge'ut*, "their mouth speaks arrogantly"), shifts from the internal organ (*chelev*) to the external organ (פֶּה, "mouth"), from the sealed heart to the speaking lips. The term גֵּאוּת (*ge'ut*, "pride/arrogance") is from the root גָּאָה (*ga'ah*, "to rise up/be exalted"), often used negatively for human hubris (Prov 8:13: "I hate pride and arrogance," גֵּאָה וְגָאוֹן/*ge'ah v'gaon*). The preposition בְּ (*b'*) can mean "with" (instrumental: speaking *with* arrogance) or "in" (modal: speaking *in a state of* arrogance). Either way, the speech is characterized by self-exaltation.

The grammatical discord between the singular פִּימוֹ (*pimo*, "their mouth"—collective singular) and the plural verb דִּבְּרוּ (*dibberu*, "they spoke") is a feature of Hebrew poetic idiom, where a collective noun (the mouth of the group) takes a plural verb (they spoke). This creates a rhetorical effect: the enemies speak with *one mouth*—they are unified in their arrogance—but they are *many*. The singular "mouth" suggests a monolithic, coordinated attack, not the cacophony of individual voices.

The juxtaposition of the "closed fat" (internal insensitivity) with the "speaking mouth" (external arrogance) creates a powerful moral anatomy of the oppressor. They have shut down their capacity for empathy (*chelev*) while amplifying their capacity for self-assertion (*peh*). This is the essence of the Pharisaic critique in later Jewish tradition—those who "say and do not do" (Matt 23:3), whose external piety (or in this case, arrogant confidence) masks an internal vacancy of compassion.

## Verse 11

**אַ֭שֻּׁרֵינוּ עַתָּ֣ה סְבָב֑וּנוּ; עֵינֵיהֶ֥ם יָ֝שִׁ֗יתוּ לִנְט֥וֹת בָּאָֽרֶץ׃**

*Our steps—now they surround us; their eyes they set to spread out on the earth.*

The verse intensifies the spatial siege imagery introduced in verse 9. The opening word אַשֻּׁרֵינוּ (*ashurenu*, "our steps") shifts from first-person singular (עָלָי/*alai*, "upon me," v. 9) to first-person plural (אַשֻּׁרֵינוּ, "our steps"), a phenomenon Radak addresses: "אַשֻּׁרֵינוּ בְדָגֵשׁ הַשִּׁין; וְכֵן אִם תַּטֶּה אַשּׁוּרֵי מִנִּי הַדֶּרֶךְ (איוב לא ז). סְבָבוּנִי כְתִיב בְּיוֹ"ד וְקָרֵי בְוָא"ו; וְהוּא לָשׁוֹן רַבִּים עָלָיו וְעַל חֲבֵרָיו... וְלָשׁוֹן יָחִיד עַל עַצְמוֹ, כִּי הוּא הָעִקָּר" ("*Ashurenu* [is vocalized] with a dagesh in the shin; similarly, 'if my step (אַשּׁוּרֵי/*ashurai*) has turned aside from the way' (Job 31:7). *S'vavuni* is written [in the ketiv] with a yod [סְבָבוּנִי] and read [in the qere] with a vav [סְבָבוּנוּ]; and this is plural language for him and his companions... and singular language for himself, for he is the primary [subject]"). The shift to plural suggests David's band of fugitives in the wilderness (1 Sam 22:2: "Everyone who was in distress... gathered to him"), but the ketiv-qere variation preserves both readings: the Masoretes recognized the oscillation between individual lament (ketiv: "they surround *me*") and corporate lament (qere: "they surround *us*").

The adverb עַתָּה (*attah*, "now") creates temporal urgency and immediacy—"at this very moment" they are closing in. This is not a past threat or a potential future danger but a *present* crisis. The verb סְבָבוּנוּ (*s'vavunu*, "they surround us") is from סָבַב (*savav*, "to go around/encircle"), used in military contexts (Josh 6:3: "You shall march around [וְסַבֹּתֶם/*v'sabbotem*] the city"; 2 Sam 5:23: "Go around [הָסֵב/*hasev*] to their rear"). The enemy is not approaching linearly but surrounding, cutting off escape routes. This is siege vocabulary, evoking the encirclement of a fortified position.

The second colon shifts to the predatory gaze: עֵינֵיהֶם יָשִׁיתוּ לִנְטוֹת בָּאָרֶץ (*eineihem yashitu lintot ba'aretz*, "their eyes they set to spread out on the earth"). The verb שָׁת (*shat*, "to set/place") often describes the deliberate directing of attention or intent (Ps 73:9: "They set their mouth against heaven," שַׁתּוּ בַשָּׁמַיִם פִּיהֶם/*shattu vashamayim pihem*; Ps 84:4: "My heart and flesh sing for joy," לִבִּי וּבְשָׂרִי יְרַנְּנוּ אֶל־אֵל־חָי/*libbi uv'sari yerannenu el-El-chai*). The infinitive construct לִנְטוֹת (*lintot*, "to spread/stretch out") is from נָטָה (*natah*, "to stretch/bend"), creating the image of hunters or soldiers positioning themselves to "spread out" over the terrain—to maximize coverage and close the net.

The phrase בָּאָרֶץ (*ba'aretz*, "on the earth/ground") is ambiguous. It could mean "to prostrate [me] to the ground" (cf. Ps 44:26: "Our belly clings to the ground," דָּבְקָה לָאָרֶץ בִּטְנֵנוּ/*davkah la'aretz bitnenu*) or "to spread themselves out across the land" (territorial control). Ibn Ezra reads it tactically: "עֵינֵיהֶם יָשִׁיתוּ אוּלַי יַטּוּ אַשֻּׁרֵינוּ בָּאָרֶץ" ("They set their eyes [watching to see] whether they can turn our steps [astray] in the land"). Radak interprets: "עֵינֵיהֶם יָשִׁיתוּ עַל דַּרְכֵּנוּ לִנְטוֹת לָנוּ רִשְׁתָּם בָּאָרֶץ לְלָכְדֵנוּ" ("They set their eyes on our path, to spread their net for us in the earth to capture us"). The image is of trappers who must *watch* their prey's movements to know *where* to lay the snare.

Metzudat David synthesizes: "מְסַבְּבִים עַתָּה רַגְלֵינוּ לְלָכְדָם וְשָׂמִים עֵינֵיהֶם הֵנָּה וָהֵנָּה לֶאֱרֹב עָלֵינוּ" ("They now surround our feet to capture them, and they set their eyes here and there to ambush us"). The enemy's gaze is not passive observation but *active reconnaissance*—they are "casing" the terrain, looking for the optimal point of attack.

The motif of the enemy's *eyes* (עֵינֵיהֶם) creates a deliberate contrast with God's *eyes* in verse 2 (עֵינֶיךָ תֶּחֱזֶינָה מֵישָׁרִים/*eineikha techezenah meisharim*, "Your eyes behold what is right"). Where God's eyes discern *uprightness*, the enemies' eyes track for the *kill*. This sets up the climactic petition in verse 15, where the psalmist will "behold Your face" (אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ/*echezeh phanekha*)—a visual encounter that inverts and transcends the predatory gaze of verse 11. The hunted becomes the beholder; the fugitive becomes the face-to-face worshiper.

## Verse 12

**דִּמְיֹנ֗וֹ כְּ֭אַרְיֵה יִכְס֣וֹף לִטְרֹ֑ף, וְ֝כִכְפִ֗יר יֹשֵׁ֥ב בְּמִסְתָּרִֽים׃**

*His likeness is like a lion eager to tear, and like a young lion crouching in hiding places.*

The verse shifts from the plural enemies (סְבָבוּנוּ, v. 11) to a singular, archetypal predator. The term דִּמְיֹנוֹ (*dimyono*, "his likeness") is from the root דָּמָה (*damah*, "to be like/resemble"), creating a double simile: "his likeness is *like* a lion." The redundancy is rhetorically deliberate—it is not merely *that he is* a lion, but that *his very appearance*, his *mode of being*, evokes the lion. The lion is the master metaphor for the enemy throughout the Psalter (Pss 7:3, 10:9, 17:12, 22:14, 22:22, 35:17, 57:5, 58:7), representing apex predation: power, stealth, and inevitability.

The phrase כְאַרְיֵה יִכְסוֹף לִטְרֹף (*k'aryeh yikhsof litroף*, "like a lion eager to tear") employs the verb כָּסַף (*kasaf*, "to long for/yearn"), which typically describes intense desire or homesickness (Gen 31:30: "You longed greatly [נִכְסֹף נִכְסַפְתָּ/*nikhsof nikhsafta*] for your father's house"; Ps 84:3: "My soul longs [נִכְסְפָה/*nikhsefah*], even faints, for the courts of the LORD"). The choice of *kasaf* rather than a simple "seek" or "pursue" verb anthropomorphizes the lion, attributing to it an *emotional craving*—not merely hunger but *longing*. The infinitive לִטְרֹף (*litroף*, "to tear") is from טָרַף (*taraf*, "to tear/rend"), the technical term for the lion's kill (Gen 37:33: "Joseph has surely been torn to pieces," טָרֹף טֹרַף יוֹסֵף/*tarof toraf Yosef*; Ps 22:14: "A ravening and roaring lion," אַרְיֵה טֹרֵף וְשֹׁאֵג/*aryeh toref v'sho'eg*). The verb denotes violent dismemberment, not a clean kill.

The second colon introduces a second leonine image: וְכִכְפִיר יֹשֵׁב בְּמִסְתָּרִים (*v'khkhefir yoshev b'mistarim*, "and like a young lion crouching in hiding places"). The term כְּפִיר (*kefir*, "young lion") is distinct from אַרְיֵה (*aryeh*, "lion"). BDB glosses *kefir* as "young lion, lion in the prime of life," suggesting not a cub but a juvenile or subadult male, still learning to hunt. The verb יֹשֵׁב (*yoshev*, "sitting/crouching") is the participial form of יָשַׁב (*yashav*, "to sit/dwell"), used for the lion's ambush posture (cf. Lam 3:10: "He is to me like a bear lying in wait, a lion in hiding places," דֹּב אֹרֵב הוּא לִי אַרְיֵה בְּמִסְתָּרִים/*dov orev hu li aryeh b'mistarim*). The plural מִסְתָּרִים (*mistarim*, "hiding places") is from the root סָתַר (*satar*, "to hide/conceal"), the same root as תַּסְתִּירֵנִי (*tastiyreni*, "hide me," v. 8). The irony is pointed: the psalmist seeks to be hidden *by God* (בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנִי/*b'tzel kenafekha tastiyreni*), while the enemy hides himself *to ambush* (יֹשֵׁב בְּמִסְתָּרִים/*yoshev b'mistarim*). Both are concealed, but for opposite purposes: one for protection, the other for predation.

The zoomorphic reduction of the enemy to a beast performs a crucial rhetorical function. By stripping the adversary of human moral agency and rationality, the psalmist creates a framework where *negotiation* is impossible. One does not reason with a lion; one either escapes it or destroys it. This dehumanization justifies the subsequent petition for violent divine intervention (v. 13: "Arise, O LORD... bring him down," קוּמָה יְהוָה קַדְּמָה פָנָיו הַכְרִיעֵהוּ/*qumah Adonai qadmah fanav hakhri'ehu*). If the enemy were portrayed as a misguided human, the call for his destruction might seem excessive. As a lion, it is simply pest control.

Malbim offers a naturalistic reading that distinguishes the two leonine images by developmental stage: "וידוע בטבע האריה שבהיותו כפיר אינו יוצא עדיין על טרפו רק יארב בסוכו למו ארב במסתר, עד שבא אל מעמד האריה שאז יוצא על טרף בחוץ, עפ"ז ממליץ את שאול שנדמה אל שניהם, בין אל האריה אשר יכסוף לטרף ויצא לחוץ עלי טרפו..." ("And it is known in the nature of the lion that when it is a *kefir* [young lion], it does not yet go out upon its prey but rather lurks in its den, lying in ambush in a hiding place, until it reaches the stage of an *aryeh* [mature lion], when it goes out upon prey outside. According to this, he metaphorically describes Saul, who resembled both: both the *aryeh* who eagerly tears and goes outside upon his prey..."). Malbim thus sees the dual simile as capturing *two phases* of Saul's pursuit of David: the covert phase (the young lion lurking) and the overt phase (the mature lion attacking openly).

Radak identifies the referent explicitly: "דִּמְיֹנוֹ כְּאַרְיֵה לְשׁוֹן יָחִיד עַל שָׁאוּל" ("*Dimyono* [his likeness] is singular [referring to] Saul"). The move from plural enemies (vv. 9-11) to a singular lion (v. 12) thus signals the identification of Saul as the *primary* threat, the alpha predator who commands the pack. This aligns with the narrative in 1 Samuel 26:2, where "Saul arose and went down to the Wilderness of Ziph, with three thousand chosen men of Israel, to seek David" (וַיָּקׇם שָׁאוּל וַיֵּרֶד אֶל־מִדְבַּר־זִיף וְאִתּוֹ שְׁלֹשֶׁת־אֲלָפִים אִישׁ בְּחוּרֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל לְבַקֵּשׁ אֶת־דָּוִד/*vayyaqom Sha'ul vayyered el-midbar-Zif v'ito sheloshet-alafim ish bechurei Yisra'el l'vaqqesh et-David*). Saul is the lion; the three thousand are the hunting pack.

The liturgical use of this verse in the Edot HaMizrach Seder Tekiat Shofar for Rosh Hashanah is striking. The liturgy places verse 12 at the *beginning* of a selection that culminates in verse 8: "דִּמְיֹנוֹ כְּאַרְיֵה יִכְסוֹף לִטְרֹף וְכִכְפִיר יֹשֵׁב בְּמִסְתָּרִים. הַפְלֵה חֲסָדֶיךָ מוֹשִׁיעַ חוֹסִים מִמִּתְקוֹמְמִים בִּימִינֶךָ. שָׁמְרֵנִי כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת עָיִן בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנִי" ("He is like a lion eager to tear, and like a young lion crouching in hiding places. Make wondrous Your steadfast love, O Savior of those who take refuge, from those who rise up by Your right hand. Guard me as the apple of Your eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings"). The reordering creates a *threat-response* structure: the vivid description of the predator (v. 12) is immediately answered by the plea for wondrous protection (vv. 7-8). On the Day of Judgment, the lion becomes a cipher for the *yetzer hara* (evil inclination) or Satan the Accuser, and the "shadow of wings" becomes the divine mercy that shields the defendant from the Prosecuting Attorney's maw.

## Verse 13

**קוּמָ֤ה יְהֹוָ֗ה, קַדְּמָ֣ה פָ֭נָיו הַכְרִיעֵ֑הוּ; פַּלְּטָ֥ה נַ֝פְשִׁ֗י מֵרָשָׁ֥ע חַרְבֶּֽךָ׃**

*Arise, O LORD; confront him, bring him down; deliver my soul from the wicked by Your sword.*

The verse erupts with a quadruple imperative salvo, each verb escalating the call for divine mobilization. The first, קוּמָה (*qumah*, "arise"), is the standard battle cry summoning the Divine Warrior from His throne (cf. Ps 3:8: "Arise, O LORD! Save me, O my God!" קוּמָה יְהוָה הוֹשִׁיעֵנִי אֱלֹהָי/*qumah Adonai hoshi'eni Elohai*; Num 10:35: "Arise, O LORD, and let Your enemies be scattered," קוּמָה יְהוָה וְיָפֻצוּ אֹיְבֶיךָ/*qumah Adonai v'yafutzu oyvekha*). The image is anthropomorphic: God is pictured as seated or reclining, and the petitioner calls Him to *stand up* and enter the fray. The BDB notes that קוּם often denotes "arising to action, especially military action" (e.g., Judg 8:21: "Arise yourself and fall upon us," קוּם אַתָּה וּפְגַע־בָּנוּ/*qum attah ufga'-banu*).

The second imperative, קַדְּמָה פָנָיו (*qadmah fanav*, "confront him" or "meet his face"), is from קָדַם (*qadam*, "to go before/anticipate/confront"). The verb can mean "to precede" (temporal) or "to meet head-on" (spatial). The phrase פָנָיו (*fanav*, "his face") specifies the *target* of the confrontation—the singular lion-enemy of verse 12. The imagery is of two warriors meeting face-to-face on the battlefield, a direct, frontal engagement. This is not an ambush or a flanking maneuver but a formal duel. Radak glosses: "כְּשֶׁיָּבֹא לִרְדּוֹף אוֹתִי וּלְטׇרְפֵנִי, קַדְּמָה פָנָיו הַכְרִיעֵהוּ" ("When he comes to pursue me and tear me, confront him and bring him down"). The verb קַדְּמָה functions as a military *preemption*—intercept the enemy *before* he strikes.

The third imperative, הַכְרִיעֵהוּ (*hakhri'ehu*, "bring him down"), is the hiphil of כָּרַע (*kara'*, "to bow down/kneel"), meaning "cause to bow" or "prostrate." The causative stem intensifies the action: not merely "he bows" but "force him to his knees." The image is of a warrior struck down, his legs buckling beneath him. Isaiah 10:4 uses the verb in judgment context: "Without Me they shall bow down [יִכְרַע/*yikhra'*] among the prisoners." The forced genuflection is the ultimate humiliation, the physical enactment of defeat.

The fourth imperative, פַּלְּטָה נַפְשִׁ֗י (*palletah nafshi*, "deliver my soul"), shifts from offense (arise, confront, strike down) to the desired *outcome*: my *nefesh* (soul/life) snatched from danger. The verb פָּלַט (*palat*, "to escape/deliver") is the intensive piel form, emphasizing the active extraction of the endangered person from the threat. The term נֶפֶשׁ (*nefesh*, "soul/life/throat") here denotes the *living self*, the totality of the psalmist's endangered existence. He is asking God to *extract* him from mortal peril as one would pull a drowning man from the water or a trapped animal from a snare.

The final phrase, מֵרָשָׁע חַרְבֶּֽךָ (*me-rasha' charbeka*, "from the wicked, Your sword"), is grammatically ambiguous. The traditional reading takes *charbeka* ("Your sword") in apposition to *rasha'* ("wicked"), yielding: "Deliver my soul from the wicked [who is] Your sword" (so NJPS: "from the wicked by Your sword"). In this reading, the wicked is God's *instrument*—the sword He wields to punish or test the covenant community. This theology is explicit in Isaiah 10:5: "Ah, Assyria, the rod of My anger, the staff of My fury!" (הוֹי אַשּׁוּר שֵׁבֶט אַפִּי וּמַטֶּה הוּא בְיָדָם זַעְמִי/*hoy Ashur shevet appi u-matteh hu v'yadam za'mi*). The wicked oppressor is paradoxically God's *tool*, wielded for inscrutable purposes. The petition is thus: "Deliver me from the one You Yourself have appointed to afflict me!" This creates theological tension—why would God need to be asked to protect from *His own sword*?—but it reflects the covenantal realism that all causality, even persecution, ultimately flows from YHWH's sovereign will.

An alternative parsing reads *charbeka* as instrumental: "Deliver my soul, by Your sword, from the wicked" (so Rashi: "מִכָּל רָשָׁע שֶׁהוּא חַרְבְּךָ שֶׁאַתָּה מַשְׁלִיטוֹ לְהִפָּרַע מִן הַמְחֻיָּבִים לְךָ"/*mi-kol rasha' she-hu charbeka she-attah mashlito l'hippara' min ha-mechuyavim lekha*, "from every wicked one who is Your sword, whom You empower to exact retribution from those liable to You"). In this reading, the psalmist asks God to *use His own sword*—His own power—to destroy the wicked instrument He had temporarily empowered. The sword metaphor is thus double-edged: the wicked is God's sword against Israel, but now God must turn His sword against the sword-bearer himself.

Meiri synthesizes: "קוּמָה ה' קַדְּמָה פָּנָיו, כְּלוֹמַר הַקְדֵּם אַתָּה לִרְאוֹת פָּנָיו קֹדֶם שֶׁיַּגִּיעַ אֵלַי, הַכְרִיעֵהוּ עַל בִּרְכָּיו כְּלוֹמַר שֶׁלֹּא יִהְיֶה לוֹ כֹּחַ לִרְדּוֹף אַחֲרַי, וּפַלֵּט נַפְשִׁי מֵרָשָׁע שֶׁהוּא חַרְבְּךָ" ("Arise, O LORD, confront him—meaning, You precede to see his face before he reaches me; bring him down upon his knees—meaning, so that he will not have the strength to pursue me; and deliver my soul from the wicked who is Your sword"). Meiri reads the sequence as a *preventive strike*: God must intercept (קַדְּמָה) *before* the enemy arrives, neutralize (הַכְרִיעֵהוּ) his capacity to attack, and thus effect the deliverance (פַּלְּטָה). The timing is critical—the prayer is not for *rescue* after capture but for *prevention* of the capture itself.

The Torah Temimah (see research bundle) expands the metaphor eschatologically, linking the "arising" of God to the messianic awakening: "בְּשָׁעָה שֶׁהוֹצִיאוּ אֶת רַבִּי עֲקִיבָא לַהֲרִיגָה זְמַן קְרִיאַת שְׁמַע הָיָה..." ("When they brought out Rabbi Akiva to be executed, it was the time for reciting the Shema..."). The citation (B. Berakhot 61b) recounts Akiva's martyrdom, where he interprets the command to love God "with all your soul" as the willingness to give up *nefesh* itself. The connection to Psalm 17:13's "deliver my *nefesh*" is implicit: sometimes the "deliverance" is not from death but *through* death into the beatific vision of verse 15. This rabbinic reading transforms the petition from a request for this-worldly rescue into a plea for the eschatological vindication that transcends biological survival.

## Verse 14

**מִֽמְתִ֬ים יָדְךָ֨ ׀ יְהֹוָ֡ה, מִֽמְתִ֬ים מֵחֶ֗לֶד חֶלְקָ֥ם בַּֽחַיִּים֮; וּֽצְפוּנְךָ֮ תְּמַלֵּ֢א בִ֫טְנָ֥ם, יִשְׂבְּע֥וּ בָנִ֑ים, וְהִנִּ֥יחוּ יִ֝תְרָ֗ם לְעוֹלְלֵיהֶֽם׃**

*From men, Your hand, O LORD; from men of the world, whose portion is in this life, and whose belly You fill with Your treasure; they are sated with children and leave their abundance to their babes.*

This verse is syntactically dense and theologically explosive. It describes the ultimate horizon of the enemy: not the transcendent vision of verse 15, but a horizontal, materialist *telos* bounded by biology and dynasty. The opening phrase, מִמְתִים יָדְךָ יְהוָה (*mim'tim yadkha Adonai*, "from men, Your hand, O LORD"), is elliptical and has been parsed multiple ways. The most natural reading continues the thought from verse 13: "Deliver my soul... from men [who are] Your hand"—i.e., from men whom You have empowered, who act as Your instrument. The awkward repetition—מִמְתִים (*mim'tim*, "from men") twice in rapid succession—has led some scholars to propose emendation, but the MT's redundancy is rhetorically emphatic: "From men—from men of *this* kind..."

The phrase מִמְתִים מֵחֶלֶד (*mim'tim mei-cheled*) is the crux. The term חֶלֶד (*cheled*) is rare, appearing only here and in Psalm 49:2 (מִבְּנֵי אָדָם, גַּם־בְּנֵי־אִישׁ, יַחַד עָשִׁיר וְאֶבְיוֹן/*mib'nei adam, gam-b'nei-ish, yachad 'ashir v'evyon* – though חֶלֶד itself appears in 49:2 as a parallel term for "world": שֹׁמְעוּ־זֹאת כָּל־הָעַמִּים, הַאֲזִינוּ כָּל־יֹשְׁבֵי חָלֶד/*shim'u-zot kol-ha'ammim, ha'azinu kol-yoshvei chaled*). The BDB glosses חֶלֶד as "duration, the world" and notes it is cognate with Arabic خالد (*khalid*, "to abide/endure"). However, the semantic force in context is not permanence but *transience*—the "fleeting world," the "duration" of a single biological lifespan. The NJPS renders it "the world"; Alter, "the fleeting world." Radak writes: "מִמְּתִים מִזֶּה הָעוֹלָם, שֶׁכׇּל תַּאֲוָתָם וְחֶפְצָם בָּזֶה הָעוֹלָם" ("From men of this world, whose entire desire and delight is in this world"). The men *mei-cheled* are the secularists, those whose existential horizon is strictly horizontal, limited to the *chayim* (חַיִּים, "this life") named in the next phrase.

The phrase חֶלְקָם בַּחַיִּים (*chelqam bachayim*, "their portion in this life") is a pointed contrast to the covenantal promise that YHWH is the *cheleq* (חֵלֶק, "portion") of the righteous. Psalm 16:5 declares: "יְהוָה מְנָת־חֶלְקִי וְכוֹסִי" (*Adonai menat-chelqi v'khosi*, "The LORD is the portion of my inheritance and my cup"). Psalm 73:26 affirms: "צוּר־לְבָבִי וְחֶלְקִי אֱלֹהִים לְעוֹלָם" (*tzur-levavi v'chelqi Elohim l'olam*, "God is the rock of my heart and my portion forever"). Psalm 119:57 announces: "חֶלְקִי יְהוָה" (*chelqi Adonai*, "The LORD is my portion"). Psalm 142:6 confesses: "חֶלְקִי בְּאֶרֶץ הַחַיִּים" (*chelqi b'eretz hachayim*, "my portion in the land of the living"). The wicked, by contrast, have *no* portion in God; their *cheleq* is confined to the *chayim* (this biological life). They have chosen a finite inheritance.

The next clause, וּצְפוּנְךָ תְּמַלֵּא בִטְנָם (*utzfunekha temalle vitnam*, "and Your treasure You fill their belly"), is grammatically strange. The term צָפוּן (*tzafun*, "hidden/treasure") appears to be a passive participle of צָפַן (*tzafan*, "to hide/store up"), functioning as a noun meaning "hidden things" or "treasure." The phrase can be read positively (God provides them with abundance) or negatively (their treasure-filled bellies are a sign of their materialism). The NJPS renders it: "whose belly You fill with Your treasure," implying divine provision. Yet the context—especially the contrast with verse 15—suggests critique: they *have* what they want (full bellies), but what they want is *trivial*.

The verb תְּמַלֵּא (*temalle*, "You fill") is the piel imperfect of מָלֵא (*male'*, "to fill"), with God as the subject. The BDB notes that the piel is causative/intensive: "make full, fill." The belly (*beten*, בֶּטֶן) is the receptacle of material satisfaction. Proverbs 18:20 uses the same idiom: "מִפְּרִי פִי־אִישׁ תִּשְׂבַּע בִּטְנוֹ תְּבוּאַת שְׂפָתָיו יִשְׂבָּע" ("A man's belly is satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; the produce of his lips satisfies him"). The "filling of the belly" is material prosperity, the tangible rewards of this-worldly success.

The final two clauses, יִשְׂבְּעוּ בָנִים וְהִנִּיחוּ יִתְרָם לְעוֹלְלֵיהֶֽם (*yisbe'u vanim v'hinichu yitram l'olelehem*, "they are sated with children and leave their abundance to their babes"), complete the materialist portrait. The verb שָׂבַע (*sava'*, "to be satisfied/sated") is the same root that will appear in verse 15: אֶשְׂבְּעָה (*esbe'ah*, "I shall be satisfied"). The deliberate lexical echo creates the central theological antithesis of the psalm: *they* are sated with *banim* (בָנִים, "sons"), *I* will be sated with *temunah* (תְּמוּנָה, "Your likeness"). Their satisfaction is dynastic continuity—the biological immortality of passing on wealth to grandchildren (*olelehem*, עוֹלְלֵיהֶם, "their babes"). The noun יֶתֶר (*yeter*, "abundance/remainder") denotes the *surplus*, the estate left behind. This is the ancient Near Eastern dream: prosperity, progeny, and posthumous provision. It is the patriarchal promise (to Abraham: "your descendants shall be as numerous as the stars," Gen 15:5), but *secularized*—detached from covenant and oriented entirely toward biological and economic continuity.

Radak's commentary sharpens the contrast: "חֶלְקָם הוּא בְּחַיֵּי הָעוֹלָם הַזֶּה, כִּי לֹא יִצְפּוּ לָעוֹלָם הַבָּא, אֶלָּא שֶׁצְּפוּנְךָ וְטוּבְךָ תְּמַלֵּא בִּטְנָם בָּעוֹלָם הַזֶּה" ("Their portion is in the life of this world, for they do not hope for the world to come; rather, Your treasure and goodness fill their belly in this world"). The wicked have made an existential choice: they have wagered on *bachayim* (this life) and foregone *olam haba* (the world to come). Radak's exegesis reads the verse as a description of *why* they are wicked: they have closed off the transcendent dimension and reduced existence to the immanent.

Malbim, by contrast, reads the verse as describing God's *pedagogical patience*: "הָאֲנָשִׁים שֶׁהֵם יָדְךָ... שֶׁעַל־יָדָם אַתָּה פּוֹעֵל וּמַנְהִיג יִשּׁוּב עוֹלָמְךָ... וּמְמַלֵּא בִּטְנָם... וְשָׂבְעֵי טוּבְךָ" ("The men who are Your hand... by whom You act and govern the settlement of Your world... and fill their belly... and are satisfied with Your goodness"). In this reading, the wicked are not condemned for their materialism but described as agents within the divine economy—God *uses* them to administer the world, and their reward is temporal prosperity. The implied critique is not of their wealth *per se* but of their *satisfaction* with it: they mistake the instrumental for the ultimate, the *means* for the *end*.

The liturgical reception in the Edot HaMizrach Yom Kippur Shacharit (where the full psalm is recited) and the Nisan Yehi Ratzon (where verse 14 is embedded in a sequence) treats this verse as the *foil* for verse 15. The men of *cheled* are not cursed but *pitied*—they have "succeeded" in all their goals, yet their goals are pathetically small. The prayer is not to be spared their wealth but to be spared their *values*—to desire not the full belly but the full vision.

## Verse 15

**אֲנִ֗י בְּ֭צֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶ֣ה פָנֶ֑יךָ; אֶשְׂבְּעָ֥ה בְ֝הָקִ֗יץ תְּמוּנָתֶֽךָ׃**

*As for me, in righteousness I shall behold Your face; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Your likeness.*

The psalm's theological crescendo begins with the emphatic, contrastive אֲנִי (*ani*, "as for me"). This first-person pronoun creates a decisive rupture with the "men of the world" (*mimtim mei-cheled*) of verse 14. Where *they* find their portion in *bachayim* (this life), *I* find mine in the *panim* (face) of God. The particle is not merely identificatory but adversative—"*But* as for me" or "*I*, on the other hand." The NAB captures this: "But I—let me see Your face"; NJPS: "Then I, justified, will behold Your face." The *ani* is the hinge on which the entire psalm turns, the point where the horizontal ethics of dynasty and wealth give way to the vertical theology of vision and presence.

The phrase בְּצֶדֶק (*b'tzedeq*, "in righteousness") has been parsed in multiple ways. It could be instrumental ("*by means of* righteousness I shall behold"), causal ("*because of* righteousness"), or modal ("*in a state of* righteousness"). The preposition בְּ (*b'*) is multivalent. The most compelling reading is modal-eschatological: the psalmist will behold God's face "in righteousness"—i.e., in the *state* of being vindicated, declared righteous by the divine tribunal. This echoes the opening appeal: "Hear, O LORD, *righteousness*" (שִׁמְעָה יְהוָה צֶדֶק, v. 1). The psalm began by asking God to hear *tzedeq*; it ends by affirming that *in tzedeq*—the very righteousness appealed to at the start—the psalmist will see God's face. The inclusio of *tzedeq* (vv. 1, 15) frames the entire psalm as a juridical drama that moves from petition to confident assertion of future vindication.

The verb אֶחֱזֶה (*echezeh*, "I shall behold") is the qal imperfect of חָזָה (*chazah*, "to see/behold"), a verb used primarily for prophetic visions (Num 24:4: "who sees [חֹזֶה/*chozeh*] the vision of Shaddai"; Isa 1:1: "The vision [חֲזוֹן/*chazon*] of Isaiah"). This is not ordinary seeing (רָאָה/*ra'ah*) but *beholding* or *perceiving* with spiritual insight. The object is פָנֶיךָ (*fanekha*, "Your face"), the most theologically fraught term in the entire psalm. To "see God's face" (רָאָה פְּנֵי אֱלֹהִים/*ra'ah penei Elohim*) is, in the priestly tradition, lethal (Exod 33:20: "You cannot see My face, for no man shall see Me and live," לֹא תוּכַל לִרְאֹת אֶת־פָּנָי כִּי לֹא־יִרְאַנִי הָאָדָם וָחָי/*lo tukhal lir'ot et-panai ki lo-yir'ani ha'adam vachai*). Yet Moses is granted unique access: "The LORD spoke to Moses face to face" (*panim el-panim*, Exod 33:11; Deut 34:10). The term *temunah* (תְּמוּנָה, "form/likeness") in the second colon confirms this Mosaic allusion: Numbers 12:8 privileges Moses with the vision of "the *temunah* of the LORD" (וּתְמֻנַת יְהוָה יַבִּיט/*ut'munat Adonai yabbit*).

The psalmist is claiming *Mosaic access*. He anticipates not cultic mediation (priest, sacrifice, oracle) but direct, unmediated *vision*. This is the democratization of theophany—the extension of the prophet-king's privilege to the ordinary Israelite who stands *b'tzedeq* (in righteousness). The audacity of the claim is staggering: the psalmist, hunted and beleaguered, asserts that his ultimate satisfaction will be *seeing God's face*, the very thing prohibited to mortals in the Exodus narrative.

The second colon, אֶשְׂבְּעָה בְהָקִיץ תְּמוּנָתֶךָ (*esbe'ah b'hakitz temunatekha*, "I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Your likeness"), introduces the crux of the verse: the meaning of בְּהָקִיץ (*b'hakitz*, "when I awake"). The verb קוּץ (*qutz*) means "to awake" (cf. Gen 28:16: "Jacob awoke [וַיִּיקַץ/*vayyiqatz*] from his sleep"). The phrase has been interpreted in at least three ways:

1. **Literal-Cultic**: The psalmist will awaken from a night of temple incubation. Mowinckel famously argued that the "night visitation" (פָּקַדְתָּ לַּיְלָה, v. 3) and the "awakening" frame a ritual of sleeping in the sanctuary to receive a divine oracle or vision. In this reading, *b'hakitz* is dawn, and *temunah* is the theophanic vision granted to the faithful in the morning after the vigil.

2. **Metaphorical-Spiritual**: The "awakening" is from the sleep of trouble or spiritual torpor. Ibn Ezra reads it intellectually: the psalmist will "awaken" to knowledge of God's ways, escaping the folly of materialism. The *temunah* is not a visual apparition but the *apprehension* of divine truth.

3. **Eschatological-Resurrection**: The "awakening" is from the sleep of death. Rashi and the rabbinic tradition read *b'hakitz* as the *techiyat ha-metim* (resurrection of the dead). This interpretation finds support in the *only other biblical occurrence* of the phrase בְּהָקִיץ in Daniel 12:2: "Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake [יָקִיצוּ/*yakitzu*], some to eternal life..." The intertextual link is unmistakable. The psalmist anticipates waking not from nightly sleep but from the *great sleep* of the grave, and the first sight upon waking will be the *temunah* of God.

The term תְּמוּנָה (*temunah*, "form/likeness") is lexically explosive. The BDB defines it as "likeness, representation, form," the same word used in the Decalogue's prohibition: "You shall not make for yourself an idol, or any *temunah*" (Exod 20:4: כׇּל־תְּמוּנָה/*kol-temunah*). Yet it is also the word for the *permitted* vision: "He beholds the *temunah* of the LORD" (Num 12:8). The paradox is theological: *temunah* is both forbidden (as human-made idol) and ultimate (as divine self-disclosure). The psalmist desires not to *manufacture* an image but to *receive* the vision of God's form, the self-presentation that God grants to His chosen ones. This is not idolatry but the eschatological *telos* of the righteous—to see God "as He is" (1 John 3:2: "We shall see Him as He is," ὀψόμεθα αὐτὸν καθώς ἐστιν/*opsometha auton kathōs estin*).

The verb אֶשְׂבְּעָה (*esbe'ah*, "I shall be satisfied") creates the lexical and theological climax. The root שָׂבַע (*sava'*, "to be satisfied/sated") appeared in verse 14: יִשְׂבְּעוּ בָנִים (*yisbe'u vanim*, "they are sated with children"). The deliberate repetition is the hinge of the psalm's argument. The wicked are *sated* (שָׂבַע) with *banim* (children), *chayim* (this life), *beten* (belly), *yitram* (surplus)—all horizontal, biological, material realities. The psalmist will be *sated* (שָׂבַע) with *temunah* (the form of God)—a vertical, spiritual, eternal reality. The same verb, the same satisfaction, but radically opposed objects. Augustine seized on this: "Two loves have built two cities: love of self, even to contempt of God, builds the earthly city; love of God, even to contempt of self, builds the heavenly city" (*Civ. Dei* 14.28). Psalm 17:15 is the proof-text for the *summum bonum* debate: What satisfies the human soul? Progeny or presence? Dynasty or deity? The psalmist's answer is unequivocal: only the *temunah* satiates.

Radak's commentary is definitive: "וַאֲנִי אָמַר דָּוִד: הָרְשָׁעִים אֵין לָהֶם חֵפֶץ בָּעוֹלָם הַבָּא, וְלֹא כָךְ אֲנִי כִּי אֲנִי מְצַפֶּה וּמְיַחֵל לַחֲזוֹת פָּנֶיךָ לָעוֹלָם הַבָּא" ("And I, says David: the wicked have no desire for the world to come, but not so I, for I await and hope to behold Your face in the world to come"). He continues: "בְּהָקִיץ: כִּי לֹא תָמוּת וְתִישַׁן נַפְשִׁי, הֶפֶךְ וְיִישְׁנוּ שְׁנַת עוֹלָם" ("*B'hakitz*: for my soul will not die and sleep, the opposite [of the wicked who] 'sleep eternal sleep' [Jer 51:39, 57]"). The eschatological reading is thus firmly rooted in medieval Jewish interpretation.

The liturgical reception is theologically charged. In the Sefardic Birkat Kohanim, when the Kohanim chant the second line of the blessing—"יָאֵר ה' פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ וִיחֻנֶּךָּ" (*ya'er Adonai panav elekha vichunekka*, "May the LORD make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you," Num 6:25)—the congregation responds: "אֲנִי בְּצֶדֶ
