# Verse-by-Verse Commentary: Psalm 17

## Verse 1

תְּפִלָּה לְדָוִד; שִׁמְעָה יְהוָה צֶדֶק, הַקְשִׁיבָה רִנָּתִי, הַאֲזִינָה תְפִלָּתִי בְּלֹא שִׂפְתֵי מִרְמָה.

The psalm opens with a triple imperative cascade—שִׁמְעָה (shim-**ʿĀH**), הַקְשִׁיבָה (haq-**SHIY**-vāh), הַאֲזִינָה (ha-'a-**ZIY**-nāh)—creating an escalating intensity through anaphora and sound patterning. Each verb intensifies the appeal: "hear" (שמע) denotes basic auditory reception, "give heed" (קשב) implies focused attention, and "give ear" (אזן) suggests active, sympathetic listening. This rhetorical intensification is reinforced by the phonetic structure: all three verbs end in a stressed final syllable with long vowels (**ʿĀH**, **SHIY**-vāh, **ZIY**-nāh), creating a rhythmic hammering effect that mirrors the urgent appeal.

The syntactic placement of צֶדֶק after the first imperative is syntactically ambiguous, allowing two readings. Rashi understands it as modifying the prayer itself: "Hear righteousness" meaning "hear my righteous cause." Ibn Ezra explains: "שמעה כי צדק אדבר" ("hear, for I speak righteousness")—the prayer's content is just. But modern scholarship often takes צֶדֶק as the direct object, meaning "hear what is right," an abstract noun personified as the substance of the appeal. This ambiguity is theologically productive: the psalmist simultaneously claims both the righteousness of his cause and his own moral integrity.

The climactic phrase בְּלֹא שִׂפְתֵי מִרְמָה ("from lips without deceit") employs a characteristic biblical idiom defining something by what it *lacks* rather than what it *contains*. The term מִרְמָה (deceit, treachery) appears 39 times in Scripture, often in contexts where prophets denounce false worship or legal corruption (e.g., Zephaniah 3:13: "לֹא־יַעֲשׂוּ עַוְלָה וְלֹא־יְדַבְּרוּ כָזָב וְלֹא־יִמָּצֵא בְּפִיהֶם לְשׁוֹן תַּרְמִית," "They shall do no wrong and speak no lies; a deceitful tongue shall not be in their mouths"). The psalmist thus frames his prayer within a forensic-ethical discourse, establishing from the outset that this is not manipulative petition but sincere legal appeal.

In the Sefardic Birkat Kohanim, the congregation responds to the priestly blessing's "וְיִשְׁמְרֶךָ" with verses including this opening: "שָׁמְרֵנִי אֵל כִּי חָסִיתִי בָךְ" (Psalm 16:1), transforming David's personal plea into a communal response to divine protection, showing how liturgy recontextualizes individual lament as collective prayer.

## Verse 2

מִלְּפָנֶיךָ מִשְׁפָּטִי יֵצֵא; עֵינֶיךָ תֶּחֱזֶינָה מֵישָׁרִים.

The verse employs forensic vocabulary to continue the legal appeal. The phrase מִלְּפָנֶיךָ מִשְׁפָּטִי יֵצֵא uses the verb יצא (to go forth, emerge) in its technical legal sense of "pronouncing verdict." This usage appears across biblical jurisprudence: in Deuteronomy 17:11, judicial decisions "go forth" (תַּעֲשֶׂה עַל־פִּי הַדָּבָר אֲשֶׁר יַגִּידוּ לְךָ) from authorized courts. The psalmist petitions that his vindication "emerge from before" God's tribunal—מִלְּפָנֶיךָ literally "from before Your face," invoking the imagery of standing before a judge's bench.

Rashi interprets the petition with characteristic theological nuance: "מִלְּפָנֶיךָ מִשְׁפָּטִי יֵצֵא—עֲבֵירוֹת שֶׁבְּיָדִי, שֶׁאֲנִי רָאוּי לְהִשָּׁפֵט עֲלֵיהֶם בְּיִסּוּרִין, יֵצְאוּ מִלְּפָנֶיךָ, וְלֹא יָבוֹאוּ לְפָנֶיךָ בַּדִּין" ("May the sins for which I deserve to be judged with torments go forth from before You and not come before You in judgment"). This reading, reflecting rabbinic consciousness of human imperfection, reinterprets "judgment going forth" as sins being dismissed rather than vindication being pronounced. It demonstrates medieval exegetical humility that resists the psalm's bold righteousness claims.

The parallelism shifts from jussive (יֵצֵא, "let it come forth") to direct indicative address: עֵינֶיךָ תֶּחֱזֶינָה מֵישָׁרִים ("Your eyes behold what is upright"). The verb חזה (behold) carries connotations of prophetic vision and penetrating insight—it's the term used for Moses's unique vision of God's תְּמוּנָה (form) in Numbers 12:8. The plural מֵישָׁרִים (upright things, equities) may be an abstract plural intensifying the concept, or it may refer concretely to multiple righteous acts. The ocular imagery here initiates the psalm's sustained "seeing" motif: God's eyes behold uprightly (v. 2), enemies' eyes hunt prey (v. 11), and climactically, the psalmist will behold God's face (v. 15)—a progressive reversal from being seen to seeing.

## Verse 3

בָּחַנְתָּ לִבִּי פָּקַדְתָּ לַּיְלָה, צְרַפְתַּנִי בַל־תִּמְצָא; זַמֹּתִי בַּל־יַעֲבׇר־פִּי.

This verse presents an extraordinary cluster of metallurgical-testing imagery applied to divine moral examination. The three perfect-tense verbs—בָּחַנְתָּ ("You have tested"), פָּקַדְתָּ ("You have visited"), צְרַפְתַּנִי ("You have refined")—create what the Macro analysis calls a "confidence formula": God has *already* examined the psalmist and found him pure. This is rhetorically bold, transforming defensive protestation into aggressive self-vindication.

The term צרף (to refine, smelt) provides the verse's controlling metaphor. BDB notes its usage across biblical literature for metallurgical purification: in Zechariah 13:9, God declares "וּצְרַפְתִּים כִּצְרֹף אֶת־הַכֶּסֶף" ("I will refine them as one refines silver"). Malachi 3:2-3 extends this imagery to eschatological purging: "כִּי־הוּא כְּאֵשׁ מְצָרֵף... וְיָשַׁב מְצָרֵף וּמְטַהֵר כֶּסֶף" ("For He is like a refiner's fire... He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver"). Psalm 12:7 applies it to divine speech: "אִמְרוֹת יְהוָה אֲמָרוֹת טְהֹרוֹת כֶּסֶף צָרוּף בַּעֲלִיל לָאָרֶץ מְזֻקָּק שִׁבְעָתָיִם" ("The words of the LORD are pure words, like silver refined in a crucible, purified sevenfold"). Here the psalmist claims to have undergone God's own refining process.

The phrase פָּקַדְתָּ לַּיְלָה ("You visited [me] by night") is uniquely suggestive. While פקד commonly means "visit" or "attend to," the specific mention of nighttime evokes several interpretive possibilities. Rashi, connecting this to David's affair with Bathsheba, reads it as "לְעֵת הָעֶרֶב בַּעֲוֹן בַּת שֶׁבַע" ("at eventide regarding the sin with Bathsheba"), when according to 2 Samuel 11:2, David arose from his couch. But the night-vigil interpretation is more compelling: ancient Near Eastern temple practices included incubation rituals where suppliants slept in sanctuaries awaiting divine oracles through dreams or visions. The psalm's climactic "awakening" (בְּהָקִיץ, v. 15) creates a ritual envelope suggesting the entire prayer occurs during such a temple night vigil.

The triple-negative construction (בַל־תִּמְצָא... בַּל־יַעֲבׇר) emphatically denies wrongdoing. The term זַמָּה (usually "plan, scheme," often with negative connotation) is syntactically difficult here. Ibn Ezra glosses: "זמתי דבר אשר בל יעבור פי" ("my thought: something that would not pass my mouth")—thoughts too shameful to speak, I have not even conceived. The Torah Temimah preserves a remarkable aggadic reading: "אמר איכו זממא נפל בפומיה דמאן דסני לי ולא אמר כי הא מילתא" ("He said: How I wish the scheme had fallen into the mouth of one who hates me, and I had not said such a thing")—transforming David's claim into meta-penitential wish that he had never spoken the prideful words of Psalm 26:2, "בְּחָנֵנִי יְהוָה וְנַסֵּנִי צָרְפָה כִלְיוֹתַי וְלִבִּי" ("Test me, O LORD, and try me; refine my heart and mind").

## Verse 4

לִפְעֻלּוֹת אָדָם בִּדְבַר שְׂפָתֶיךָ, אֲנִי שָׁמַרְתִּי אׇרְחוֹת פָּרִיץ.

This verse is notoriously difficult syntactically and has generated widely divergent interpretations. The core problem is whether אֲנִי שָׁמַרְתִּי אׇרְחוֹת פָּרִיץ means "I have kept [i.e., observed] the paths of the violent" or "I have kept [i.e., guarded against] the paths of the violent." The phrase is a *crux interpretum* requiring careful grammatical and contextual analysis.

The verb שמר with a direct object normally means "keep, observe, guard" and can take either sense: keeping *to* something (following it) or keeping *from* something (avoiding it). Context must determine meaning. The parallelism with verse 3's innocence claims and verse 5's assertion that "my feet have not slipped from Your paths" strongly favors the avoidance reading. Radak articulates this: "עשיתי כמעשה הרשע והפריץ" ("I have done like the deeds of the wicked and violent")—but he immediately clarifies that this is the *opposite* of what the psalmist means, requiring us to supply an implicit negation.

Ibn Ezra offers a more syntactically satisfying parsing: "מלפניך משפטי יצא שתענישני אם עיניך לא תחזינה במישרים" ("Let my judgment come forth from You that You punish me if Your eyes do not behold [me] in uprightness"). He connects this to the previous verse rather than forward, making verse 4 begin a new thought. His reading of verse 4 proper glosses: "שמרתי ארחות פריץ" as "שמתי שומרים על אורחותיו, עד שלא יעברו על דבר שפתים" ("I placed guards over his paths, so that [they] would not transgress the word of Your lips")—that is, the psalmist monitored *others'* violence to prevent it. This interpretive ingenuity shows the verse's syntactic opacity.

The term פָּרִיץ (violent one, lawless man) appears 6 times in Scripture with consistent negative valence. Its root פרץ means "break through, breach," hence one who "breaks through" social boundaries. In Jeremiah 7:11, God denounces the Temple as having become "מְעָרַת פָּרִצִים" ("a den of robbers"). The phrase אׇרְחוֹת פָּרִיץ thus denotes not merely criminal paths but paradigmatic lawlessness—the opposite of the "paths of righteousness" (מַעְגְּלֵי־צֶדֶק) celebrated in Psalm 23:3.

Liturgically, this verse appears in expanded Pesukei Dezimra on Yom Kippur in Edot HaMizrach tradition. Its placement on the Day of Judgment, when the community corporately confesses sins, recontextualizes the individual's protestation of innocence as communal aspiration—not denying sin, but asserting the possibility of moral purification that the liturgy enacts.

## Verse 5

תָּמֹךְ אֲשֻׁרַי בְּמַעְגְּלוֹתֶיךָ; בַּל־נָמוֹטּוּ פְעָמָי.

The verse shifts from retrospective moral accounting to present petition using spatial-kinetic imagery. The imperative תָּמֹךְ (support, sustain) governs the object אֲשֻׁרַי (my steps), creating a prayer for ongoing moral stability. The verb תמך appears 21 times in Scripture, often in contexts of physical or institutional support. Isaiah 9:6 uses it messianically: "לְמַרְבֵּה הַמִּשְׂרָה וּלְשָׁלוֹם אֵין־קֵץ עַל־כִּסֵּא דָוִד וְעַל־מַמְלַכְתּוֹ לְהָכִין אֹתָהּ וּלְסַעֲדָהּ" ("Of the increase of His government and of peace there will be no end, upon the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to *sustain* it"). The psalmist thus asks for divine upholding analogous to royal-institutional support.

The phrase בְּמַעְגְּלוֹתֶיךָ ("in Your paths/tracks") uses the rare term מַעְגָּל rather than the more common דֶּרֶךְ or אֹרַח. BDB distinguishes these: דֶּרֶךְ is the general "way," אֹרַח is a "path" or "course," while מַעְגָּל specifically denotes "wagon-tracks" or "ruts"—the deeply worn grooves created by repeated passage. The plural form intensifies this: not just one path but multiple interconnected tracks. Metaphorically, these are the established, well-worn ways of righteousness. Psalm 65:12 uses מַעְגָּל beautifully: "מַעְגָּלֶיךָ יִרְעֲפוּן דָּשֶׁן" ("Your paths drip with fatness"), depicting God's tracks as so laden with blessing that they overflow. Proverbs 4:11 counsels: "בְּדֶרֶךְ חָכְמָה הֹרֵתִיךָ הִדְרַכְתִּיךָ בְּמַעְגְּלֵי־יֹשֶׁר" ("I have taught you the way of wisdom; I have led you in *right tracks*").

The climactic negation בַּל־נָמוֹטּוּ פְעָמָי ("that my feet may not slip") employs the verb מוט, which means "totter, slip, shake." This verb appears prominently in Psalm 16:8's trust declaration: "לֹא אֶמּוֹט" ("I shall not be moved"), and in the pilgrimage song Psalm 121:3: "אַל־יִתֵּן לַמּוֹט רַגְלֶךָ" ("He will not let your foot slip"). The Malbim offers distinctive theological nuance here: he distinguishes between the direct path (אֹרַח) of righteousness and the *circuitous* path (מַעְגָּל) sometimes necessary to reach righteous ends. He writes: "המעגל הוא הדרך הסבובי, שלפעמים צריך לנטות מן הארח הישר אל המעגל... למשל הרחמים הוא הדרך הישר וכן הענוה והבושת, ולפעמים צריך לנטות אל האכזריות והגאוה והעזות נגד רשעים" ("The *maʿgal* is the winding way, which sometimes requires deviating from the straight path... for example, mercy is the straight way, as are humility and shame, but sometimes one must incline toward cruelty, pride, and boldness against the wicked"). This sophisticated moral psychology recognizes that ethical life sometimes requires tactical adaptation—what we might call "situational ethics"—and the psalmist prays for divine guidance to navigate these morally complex "circuitous paths" without ultimately "slipping" from righteousness.

## Verse 6

אֲנִי־קְרָאתִיךָ כִּֽי־תַעֲנֵנִי אֵל; הַֽט־אׇזְנְךָ֥ לִי, שְׁמַע אִמְרָתִֽי.

The verse marks a tonal shift from defensive protestation to confident petition. The emphatic pronoun אֲנִי (I) at the verse opening, placed before the verb, creates fronted focus: "*I* have called You." This first-person emphasis contrasts with the third-person descriptions of enemies that will follow, creating a rhetorical polarization between the supplicant and his adversaries. The perfect verb קְרָאתִיךָ (I have called You) asserts an established relationship—this is not a first-time petitioner but one with a history of divine address.

The confident assertion כִּֽי־תַעֲנֵנִי ("for/because You will answer me") employs כִּי in its causal-assurance sense. The verbal form תַעֲנֵנִי (you will answer me, 2ms imperfect + 1cs suffix) expresses not merely hope but certainty of response. This confidence echoes other psalmic trust declarations: Psalm 4:2 opens, "בְּקָרְאִי עֲנֵנִי אֱלֹהֵי צִדְקִי" ("When I call, answer me, O God of my righteousness"). Rashi glosses: "כִּי בָּטוּחַ אֲנִי שֶׁתַּעֲנֵנִי" ("For I am confident that You will answer me"). This interpretive move transforms grammatical future into epistemic certainty—the imperfect verb expressing not temporal futurity but assured divine responsiveness.

The divine epithet אֵל (God) rather than the Tetragrammaton יהוה appears uniquely here in verse 6. While both names appear elsewhere in the psalm (יהוה in vv. 1, 13, 14), the choice of אֵל—emphasizing divine power and might—may signal a shift from forensic appeal to power-based petition. The name אֵל derives from a root meaning "strength, might" and appears in compound divine names like אֵל שַׁדַּי (God Almighty) and אֵל עֶלְיוֹן (God Most High). Its use here subtly invokes God's capacity to act decisively on behalf of the petitioner.

The renewed auditory appeal—הַֽט־אׇזְנְךָ֥ לִי, שְׁמַע אִמְרָתִֽי ("Incline Your ear to me, hear my utterance")—returns to the triple-imperative pattern of verse 1 but with variation. The verb נטה (incline, bend) creates embodied divine imagery: God must *lean down* to hear, suggesting the psalmist's lowly position. This same verb appears in Moses's final plea: "הַאֲזִינוּ הַשָּׁמַיִם וַאֲדַבֵּרָה" (Deuteronomy 32:1, "Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak"), where it governs cosmic addressees. Here, applied to God's ear, it creates a physicalized theology of prayer—divine attention as bodily posture.

The term אִמְרָה (utterance, saying) appears 37 times in Scripture, 19 of them in Psalm 119 referring to God's own word/commandments. Its use here for the psalmist's prayer may suggest the authority or care with which he frames his petition—not mere spontaneous outcry but crafted, authoritative speech. Psalm 19:15 uses it in the classic petitionary formula: "יִהְיוּ לְרָצוֹן אִמְרֵי־פִי וְהֶגְיוֹן לִבִּי לְפָנֶיךָ" ("May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before You"). The psalmist thus claims that his prayer possesses the formal qualities worthy of divine attention.

## Verse 7

הַפְלֵה חֲסָדֶיךָ, מוֹשִׁיעַ חוֹסִים מִמִּתְקוֹמְמִים בִּֽימִינֶֽךָ.

This verse contains one of the psalm's most theologically dense constructions, compact with participial forms and rare vocabulary. The imperative הַפְלֵה (make wonderful, distinguish, separate) comes from the root פלא, which governs the realm of the marvelous and extraordinary. This is the verbal root behind the noun פֶּלֶא (wonder, marvel), used for the exodus wonders in Exodus 15:11: "מִי־כָמֹכָה נֶאְדָּר בַּקֹּדֶשׁ נוֹרָא תְהִלֹּת עֹשֵׂה פֶלֶא" ("Who is like You, majestic in holiness, awesome in praises, working wonders?"). The Hiphil form הַפְלֵה means "to make distinct" or "to set apart remarkably." 

The object is חֲסָדֶיךָ (your steadfast loves/mercies), plural likely for intensification—the manifold expressions of divine covenant loyalty. The BDB entry for חֶסֶד shows its semantic range spanning "kindness, loving-kindness, covenant faithfulness." Crucially, God's חֶסֶד is not generic benevolence but relationship-specific loyalty, enacted within covenant bonds. The plural form appears elsewhere in Psalm 89:2: "חַסְדֵי יְהוָה עוֹלָם אָשִׁירָה" ("I will sing of the LORD's steadfast love forever"), where multiple historical acts of divine faithfulness are in view.

The participial description מוֹשִׁיעַ חוֹסִים ("Savior of those who take refuge") creates a compound divine epithet. The Hiphil participle מוֹשִׁיעַ (Savior, the one who saves) is God's characteristic title throughout Scripture—Isaiah 43:3 declares, "כִּי אֲנִי יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ קְדוֹשׁ יִשְׂרָאֵל מוֹשִׁיעֶךָ" ("For I am the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior"). The participle חוֹסִים (those who take refuge) derives from the verb חסה, which appears 37 times in Psalms, more than in all other books combined. This is distinctly Psalter vocabulary. Psalm 2:12 concludes with the beatitude: "אַשְׁרֵי כָּל־חוֹסֵי בוֹ" ("Blessed are all who take refuge in Him"). The combination מוֹשִׁיעַ חוֹסִים thus crystallizes a core psalmic theology: God characteristically saves those who flee to Him for protection.

The phrase מִמִּתְקוֹמְמִים בִּֽימִינֶֽךָ is syntactically compressed. The Hithpolel participle מִּתְקוֹמְמִים (those who rise up against) appears only here in this form, though the root קום (rise, stand) is common. The prefix הִתְ creates reflexive/reciprocal action: these are people who "raise themselves up" in opposition. Radak interprets: "כִּי כֻלָּם יָדְעוּ כִּי הַמְּלוּכָה לִי מֵאִתְּךָ וְהַמּוֹרְדִים בִּי מוֹרְדִים בָּךְ" ("For all know that the kingdom is mine from You, and those who rebel against me rebel against You")—reading the opposition as politically treasonous and theologically blasphemous simultaneously. The phrase בִּֽימִינֶֽךָ (by/with Your right hand) invokes the quintessential symbol of divine power. Exodus 15:6 celebrates: "יְמִינְךָ יְהוָה נֶאְדָּרִי בַּכֹּחַ יְמִינְךָ יְהוָה תִּרְעַץ אוֹיֵב" ("Your right hand, O LORD, glorious in power, Your right hand, O LORD, shatters the enemy").

In liturgy, this verse appears in the Edot HaMizrach Seder Korban HaNesi'im during the first thirteen days of Nissan, embedded in the Yehi Ratzon for the tribe of Reuben: "קוּמָה עֶזְרָתָה לָּנוּ וּפְדֵנוּ לְמַעַן חַסְדֶּךָ. הַפְלֵה חֲסָדֶיךָ מוֹשִׁיעַ חוֹסִים" ("Arise, help us, redeem us for Your steadfast love's sake. Make wondrous Your loving-kindnesses, O Savior of those who take refuge"). This liturgical reuse transforms a personal plea into tribal-national petition, yoking ancient Israelite tribal identity to ongoing redemptive hope.

## Verse 8

שׇׁמְרֵנִי כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת־עָיִן; בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵֽנִי.

This verse presents two of Scripture's most intimate and powerful protection metaphors in a single bicolon, creating what may be the most emotionally resonant line in the entire psalm. The first metaphor, כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת־עָיִן (literally "like the little man, daughter of the eye"), is an anatomical idiom for the pupil—the dark center of the eye where, remarkably, one can see a miniature reflection of oneself. This reflexive quality generates the phrase's tenderness: the pupil is precious precisely because it contains an image of the viewer.

The etymology of אִישׁוֹן is disputed but likely derives from אִישׁ (man) with a diminutive suffix, hence "little man"—the tiny human figure one sees reflected in another's pupil. The construct בַּת־עָיִן (daughter of the eye) adds a second layer of tenderness through the feminine noun בַּת (daughter), creating a doubly precious image: the vulnerable, carefully protected center of vision. This exact phrase appears elsewhere only three times in Scripture. Deuteronomy 32:10 uses it in Moses's final song describing God's care for Israel in the wilderness: "יְסֹֽבְבֶנְהוּ יְבוֹנְנֵהוּ יִצְּרֶנְהוּ כְּאִישׁוֹן עֵינוֹ" ("He encircled him, He cared for him, He guarded him as the pupil of His eye"). Proverbs 7:2 commands the student: "שְׁמֹר מִצְוֺתַי וֶחְיֵה וְתוֹרָתִי כְּאִישׁוֹן עֵינֶיךָ" ("Keep my commandments and live, and my teaching as the pupil of your eye"). Zechariah 2:12 applies it to Israel's enemies: "כִּי הַנֹּגֵעַ בָּכֶם נֹגֵעַ בְּבָבַת עֵינוֹ" ("For whoever touches you touches the pupil of His eye"). The cross-textual pattern shows this idiom consistently expresses the most extreme form of protective care—the instinctive, involuntary guarding of one's most vulnerable sensory organ.

The second metaphor shifts scale dramatically from the micro (pupil) to the macro (wings): בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵֽנִי (in the shadow of Your wings, hide me). The phrase צֵל כְּנָפַיִם appears six times in Psalms (17:8, 36:8, 57:2, 61:5, 63:8, 91:4), always invoking divine protection. But the referent is deliberately ambiguous: does it image God as a mother bird sheltering chicks (as in Deuteronomy 32:11, "כְּנֶשֶׁר יָעִיר קִנּוֹ עַל־גּוֹזָלָיו יְרַחֵף," "As an eagle stirs up its nest, hovers over its young"), or does it reference the cherubim's wings overshadowing the ark in the Holy of Holies (Exodus 25:20, "וְהָיוּ הַכְּרֻבִים פֹּרְשֵׂי כְנָפַיִם לְמַעְלָה סֹכְכִים בְּכַנְפֵיהֶם עַל־הַכַּפֹּרֶת," "The cherubim shall spread out their wings above, screening the mercy seat with their wings")? The Radak opts for the cultic reading: "צל כנפיך, כנפי הכרובים" ("the shadow of Your wings—the wings of the cherubim"), understanding the psalmist as seeking literal sanctuary in the Temple's Holy of Holies.

The verb תַּסְתִּירֵֽנִי (hide me) from the root סתר creates a semantic field of concealment and protection that appears throughout Psalms. Psalm 27:5 uses the same verb in parallel with similar imagery: "כִּי יִצְפְּנֵנִי בְּסֻכֹּה בְּיוֹם רָעָה יַסְתִּרֵנִי בְּסֵתֶר אָהֳלוֹ" ("For He will conceal me in His pavilion on the day of trouble; He will hide me in the shelter of His tent"). Psalm 31:21 creates a triple-protection image: "תַּסְתִּירֵם בְּסֵתֶר פָּנֶיךָ מֵרֻכְסֵי־אִישׁ תִּצְפְּנֵם בְּסֻכָּה מֵרִיב לְשֹׁנוֹת" ("You hide them in the shelter of Your presence from human scheming; You shelter them in a pavilion from contentious tongues").

Liturgically, this verse has extraordinary resonance. In the Sefardic Birkat Kohanim, as noted in the liturgical bundle, the congregation responds to the priestly blessing's וְיִשְׁמְרֶךָ with precisely these words: "שָׁמְרֵנִי אֵל כִּי חָסִיתִי בָךְ: שָׁמְרֵנִי כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת עַיִן בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנִי" ("Guard me, O God, for I have taken refuge in You. Guard me like the pupil of the eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings"). This transforms the Kohanim's blessing-as-pronouncement into the congregation's blessing-as-petition, creating a liturgical dialogue. The Sefard Friday night zemirot also employs this imagery, describing Israel as "עַם נְצוֹר כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת עַיִן נִשְׁמָר" ("a people guarded, like the pupil of the eye, protected"), and it appears again at Shabbat's conclusion in the Edot HaMizrach Seudah Revi'it meditation: "שָׁמְרֵנוּ כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת עָיִן, וּבְצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנוּ" ("guard us like the pupil of the eye, and in the shadow of Your wings, hide us"). This liturgical framing—from Shabbat's joyous entry to its wistful departure—poetically envelops the entire Sabbath experience within God's protective embrace.

## Verse 9

מִפְּנֵי רְשָׁעִים זוּ שַׁדּוּנִי; אֹיְבַי בְּנֶפֶשׁ יַקִּיפוּ עָלָֽי.

The psalm now transitions from petition to complaint, introducing the enemies who necessitate divine protection. The phrase מִפְּנֵי רְשָׁעִים (from the face of the wicked) employs the common prepositional idiom פָּנִים for spatial-personal proximity: "from before" the wicked, suggesting their threatening nearness. The demonstrative זוּ (these, this) is syntactically odd—it can function as a relative pronoun ("who") or demonstrative ("these"), creating ambiguity. Rashi takes it as introducing a relative clause: "בִּשְׁבִיל זֹאת שֶׁשּׁוֹדְדִים אוֹתִי אוֹיְבַי" ("because of this: that my enemies rob me"). Ibn Ezra reads זוּ as demonstrative: "כמו: אלה" ("like 'these'").

The verb שַׁדּוּנִי (they despoil me, rob me) derives from שדד, which means "devastate, despoil, destroy." This root appears 58 times in Scripture, predominantly in prophetic oracles of judgment. Isaiah 33:1 creates a wordplay: "הוֹי שׁוֹדֵד וְאַתָּה לֹא שָׁדוּד וּבוֹגֵד וְלֹא־בָגְדוּ בוֹ כַּהֲתִמְךָ שׁוֹדֵד תּוּשַּׁד" ("Woe to you, destroyer, who yourself have not been destroyed; you traitor, whom none has betrayed! When you have ceased to destroy, you will be destroyed"). Jeremiah uses it for Babylonian devastation: "שֹׁד עַל־שֹׁד נִקְרָא כִּי שֻׁדְּדָה כָּל־הָאָרֶץ" (Jeremiah 4:20, "Disaster follows disaster, for the whole land is devastated"). The psalmist thus characterizes his enemies' actions not as mere opposition but as comprehensive pillage and ruination.

The second colon creates a hunting/warfare image through the verb יַקִּיפוּ (they encircle, surround). This verb from נקף appears 17 times in the Hebrew Bible, often in military contexts. Joshua 6:3-4 uses it for Israel's tactics at Jericho: "וְסַבֹּתֶם אֶת־הָעִיר... וְכֹה תַעֲשׂוּ שֵׁשֶׁת יָמִים... וּבַיּוֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִי תָּסֹבּוּ אֶת־הָעִיר שֶׁבַע פְּעָמִים" ("And you shall march around the city... thus shall you do for six days... and on the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times"). The enemy's encirclement creates claustrophobic spatial threat—the psalmist cannot escape in any direction.

The phrase בְּנֶפֶשׁ (with greed, greedily, mortally) is semantically loaded. The noun נֶפֶשׁ has a semantic range including "soul, life, throat, appetite, desire." Here it likely means "with [desire for my] life" or "with deadly intent"—they circle seeking to take his נֶפֶשׁ (life/soul). Radak explains: "אֹיְבַי אֲשֶׁר יַקִּיפוּ וְיָסוֹבְּבוּ עָלַי בְּנַפְשִׁי, כְּלוֹמַר: לָקַחַת נַפְשִׁי" ("My enemies who encircle and surround me against my soul, that is: to take my life"). Alternatively, נֶפֶשׁ here may express the emotional intensity of the enemies' hatred—"with all their soul/being" they pursue. This ambiguity enriches the verse: the enemies attack both with mortal intent and with total emotional investment in destruction.

The vocabulary of surrounding and encirclement continues into verse 11, creating an intensifying spatial nightmare. This anticipates the climactic lion metaphor in verse 12, where the singular predator emerges from the plural threat—a focusing of diffuse danger into archetypal menace.

## Verse 10

חֶלְבָּמוֹ סָּגְרוּ; פִּימוֹ דִּבְּרוּ בְגֵאֽוּת.

This verse presents a challenging syntactic structure and an unusual anatomical metaphor that has puzzled interpreters for centuries. The phrase חֶלְבָּמוֹ סָּגְרוּ (their fat they have closed/shut up) is notoriously difficult. The noun חֵלֶב normally means "fat, suet"—specifically, the sacrificial fat portions reserved for God in the Priestly legislation (Leviticus 3:16-17: "כָּל־חֵלֶב לַיהוָה חֻקַּת עוֹלָם," "all fat belongs to the LORD, a perpetual statute"). But what does it mean to "close" or "shut up" one's fat?

Rashi interprets metaphorically: "בְּחֶלְבָּם וּבְשֻׁמָּנָם סָגְרוּ לִבָּם וְעֵינֵיהֶם מֵהַבִּיט אֶל פָּעֳלְךָ לִירָאָה מִפָּנֶיךָ" ("With their fat and their fatness they have closed their heart and their eyes from looking at Your work, to fear You"). He reads חֵלֶב as metonymic for the heart, understanding the verse as describing moral insensitivity caused by self-indulgent prosperity. This connects to the prophetic critique of excess: Deuteronomy 32:15 warns, "וַיִּשְׁמַן יְשֻׁרוּן וַיִּבְעָט שָׁמַנְתָּ עָבִיתָ כָּשִׂיתָ" ("Jeshurun grew fat and kicked—you grew fat, bloated, gorged"), where physical fatness symbolizes spiritual apostasy.

The Radak offers a simpler reading: "רוֹב שֻׁמְנָם סָגַר פִּיהֶם, עַל כֵּן דִּבְּרוּ בְגֵאוּת מֵרוֹב תַּעֲנוּגָם" ("Their great sleekness has shut their mouth; therefore they speak with pride from their great luxury"). He understands the first colon as causal background for the second: material satiety produces arrogant speech. This reading finds support in Psalm 73:7, which describes the prosperous wicked: "יָצָא מֵחֵלֶב עֵינֵמוֹ" ("Their eyes bulge from fatness"), where physical surfeit is visible in bodily appearance.

Ibn Ezra proposes grammatical solutions, suggesting either חֵלֶב as abbreviation for בְּחֶלְבָּם or reading the verse as chiastic: "חֶלְבָּמוֹ—סָגוּר בְּקִרְבָּם וּפִימוֹ—מְדַבֵּר גַּאֲוָה" ("Their fat is shut up within them, and their mouth speaks pride"). The Malbim characteristically seeks to preserve literal meaning: he reads "their fat" as metonymy for "their mouths" (since fat surrounds the oral cavity), so "their fat shut up" means "their fat-surrounded mouths have closed"—metaphorically, their mouths are so stuffed with richness that when they finally speak, only arrogance emerges.

The second colon, פִּימוֹ דִּבְּרוּ בְגֵאֽוּת (with their mouth they speak with pride/arrogance), employs an unusual grammatical construction: the singular noun פִּימוֹ (their mouth) with the plural verb דִּבְּרוּ (they spoke). This grammatical discord may be a collective singular—one mouth representing the unified arrogant discourse of the enemy group. The term גֵאוּת (pride, arrogance, haughtiness) appears 19 times in Scripture, always with negative valence. Proverbs 8:13 defines Wisdom's hatred: "יִרְאַת יְהוָה שְׂנֹאת רָע גֵּאָה וְגָאוֹן וְדֶרֶךְ רָע" ("The fear of the LORD is hatred of evil. Pride and arrogance and the way of evil"). Isaiah 13:11 declares God's judgment: "וּפָקַדְתִּי עַל־תֵּבֵל רָעָה וְעַל־רְשָׁעִים עֲוֺנָם וְהִשְׁבַּתִּי גְּאוֹן זֵדִים וְגַאֲוַת עָרִיצִים אַשְׁפִּיל" ("I will punish the world for its evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; I will put an end to the pride of the arrogant, and lay low the pompousness of tyrants").

The verse as a whole creates a portrait of the prosperous wicked: their material abundance has produced spiritual obtuseness (closed fat/heart) that manifests in verbal hubris. This moral-physical linkage—satiety breeding arrogance—is a recurring biblical theme, reflecting ancient Israel's suspicion of unchecked wealth. The psalm thus embeds its legal-theological plea within a broader wisdom critique of prosperity's corrupting potential.

## Verse 11

אַשֻּׁרֵינוּ עַתָּה סְבָבוּנוּ; עֵינֵיהֶם יָשִׁיתוּ לִנְטוֹת בָּאָֽרֶץ.

This verse intensifies the spatial threat initiated in verse 9, now depicting the enemy's encirclement at its crisis point. The opening word אַשֻּׁרֵינוּ (our steps) has a textual variant: the Ketiv (written text) reads סְבָבוּנִי (they have surrounded *me*, singular) while the Qere (traditional reading) has סְבָבוּנוּ (they have surrounded *us*, plural). Radak notes this variation: "סְבָבוּנִי כָּתִיב בְּיוֹ״ד... וְקְרִי בְוָא״ו; הַכְּתָב בִלְשׁוֹן יָחִיד עַל עַצְמוֹ, כִּי הוּא הָעִקָּר" ("It is written סְבָבוּנִי with yod... but read with waw; the written form is singular, referring to himself, for he is the main one"). The oscillation between singular and plural reflects the psalm's movement between individual and representative experience—David speaks for himself but also for any righteous sufferer.

The temporal marker עַתָּה (now, at present) creates narrative urgency: the encirclement is *happening* as the psalmist prays. This is not retrospective description but present-tense distress. The verb סבב (surround, encircle) appears throughout military and hunting contexts in Scripture. In the Song of Deborah, enemy forces "surround" Israel: "בַּיָּמִים הָהֵם סָבְבוּ עָלֵינוּ" (Judges 5:6 implied context). The intensification from verse 9's יַקִּיפוּ (encircle) to verse 11's סְבָבוּנוּ (surround us) creates claustrophobic progression—the circle tightens.

The second colon introduces a sinister ocular dimension: עֵינֵיהֶם יָשִׁיתוּ לִנְטוֹת בָּאָרֶץ (their eyes they set to cast down to the earth). The verb שית with עֵינַיִם as object commonly means "fix one's gaze, set one's eyes upon." Genesis 44:21 uses this idiom when Joseph commands: "וְאָשִׂימָה עֵינִי עָלָיו" ("and I will set my eyes upon him"). Here, the enemy's gaze is both predatory (hunting) and dominating (casting down). The infinitive construct לִנְטוֹת (to cast down, to stretch out, to turn aside) from the root נטה creates ambiguity. Does it mean casting *down* to the ground (violence), or casting *toward* the earth (hunting, tracking)? 

Radak explains: "עֵינֵיהֶם יָשִׁיתוּ עַל דַּרְכֵּנוּ לִנְטוֹת לָנוּ רִשְׁתָּם בָּאָרֶץ לְלָכְדֵנוּ" ("They set their eyes upon our path to spread their net for us in the earth to capture us"). He reads the verse as describing trap-setting—the enemies watch the psalmist's movements to position snares. This hunting imagery connects to verse 12's lion metaphor, creating a sustained predation theme. Alternatively, the phrase may depict the enemies' desire to physically cast down the psalmist, pressing him into the earth—a gesture of total domination. Job 22:29 uses similar language: "כִּי־הִשְׁפִּיל וַתֹּאמֶר גֵּוָה וְשַׁח עֵינַיִם יוֹשִׁעַ" ("When they are cast down you say, 'It is pride,' but He saves the lowly").

The sustained "eye" motif creates progression: God's eyes behold what is upright (v. 2), the psalmist asks to be guarded as the apple of God's eye (v. 8), and now enemy eyes set to cast down (v. 11). This ocular theology culminates in verse 15's promise that the psalmist will behold God's face—a reversal where the hunted becomes the seer, where oppressive gaze is replaced by beatific vision.

In the Edot HaMizrach tradition, this verse (as part of the full psalm recitation) appears in the Yom Kippur Shacharit Pesukei Dezimra. Its inclusion on the Day of Judgment transforms personal enemies into spiritual adversaries—the accusing forces that seek to "cast down" the penitent. The liturgical reframing makes the verse's spatial urgency into spiritual urgency: not merely physical encirclement but the existential siege of judgment day itself.

## Verse 12

דִּמְיֹנוֹ כְּאַרְיֵה יִכְסוֹף לִטְרֹף; וְכִכְפִיר יֹשֵׁב בְּמִסְתָּרִֽים.

The diffuse plural enemies of verses 9-11 now coalesce into a singular archetypal predator through one of Scripture's most vivid animal similes. The verse employs double comparison—lion (אַרְיֵה) and young lion (כְּפִיר)—to create a composite image of predatory menace. The shift from plural to singular (דִּמְיֹנוֹ, "his likeness") may represent intensification rather than merely poetic variation: the many crystallize into the one, or one enemy emerges as leader. Radak identifies this singular enemy as Saul: "דִּמְיֹנוֹ לְשׁוֹן יָחִיד עַל שָׁאוּל. אָמַר כְּמוֹ שֶׁאָמַר עָלָיו בְּמִזְמוֹר עַל דִּבְרֵי כוּשׁ בֶּן יְמִינִי: פֶּן יִטְרֹף כְּאַרְיֵה נַפְשִׁי" ("The singular 'his likeness' refers to Saul. He says as he said about him in the Psalm concerning Cush the Benjaminite: 'Lest he tear my soul like a lion,'" Psalm 7:3).

The term דִּמְיֹן (likeness, resemblance) appears only here in this form, from the root דמה (be like, resemble). Its rarity gives the simile special emphasis—not just "he is like a lion" but "his very resemblance/form is that of a lion," suggesting essential rather than incidental similarity. The verb יִכְסוֹף (he yearns, craves, is eager) from כסף adds psychological depth to the predator image. This is not merely instinctive hunger but desire—the lion *longs* to tear prey. Numbers 11:4 uses this verb for Israel's wilderness craving: "וַיִּתְאַוּוּ תַּאֲוָה... הָאסַפְסֻף אֲשֶׁר בְּקִרְבּוֹ וַיֹּאמְרוּ מִי יַאֲכִלֵנוּ בָּשָׂר" ("The rabble that was among them had a strong craving... and they said, 'Who will feed us meat?'"). Genesis 31:30 uses it for Laban's complaint to Jacob: "כִּי נִכְסֹף נִכְסַפְתָּ לְבֵית אָבִיךָ" ("because you yearned greatly for your father's house"). The verb thus carries emotional intensity beyond physical need—this is passionate, consuming desire.

The infinitive construct לִטְרֹף (to tear, rend prey) from טרף is the technical term for predatory action. Nahum 2:13 describes the lion's nature: "אַרְיֵה טֹרֵף בְּדֵי גֹרוֹתָיו וּמְחַנֵּק לְלִבְאֹתָיו" ("The lion tearing prey for its cubs and strangling [prey] for its lionesses"). Psalm 7:3 uses identical language for the threat the psalmist faces: "פֶּן־יִטְרֹף כְּאַרְיֵה נַפְשִׁי" ("lest he tear my soul like a lion"), establishing an intertextual link between Psalms 7 and 17.

The second colon introduces a second lion figure, the כְּפִיר (young lion, lion in prime), distinguished from the mature אַרְיֵה. Job 4:10-11 uses both terms: "שַׁאֲגַת אַרְיֵה וְקוֹל שָׁחַל וְשִׁנֵּי כְפִירִים נִתָּעוּ. לַיִשׁ אֹבֵד מִבְּלִי־טָרֶף" ("The roar of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, the teeth of the young lions are broken. The strong lion perishes for lack of prey"). The כְּפִיר is the lion at peak hunting ability—still agile but fully powerful. The Malbim draws an elaborate distinction based on hunting behavior: "בְּהֱיוֹתוֹ כְּפִיר אֵינוֹ יוֹצֵא עֲדַיִן עַל טַרְפּוֹ רַק יֶאֱרֹב בְּסוּכוֹ... עַד שֶׁבָּא אֶל מַעֲמַד הָאַרְיֵה שֶׁאָז יוֹצֵא עַל טַרְפּוֹ" ("When it is a young lion it does not yet go out upon its prey but lies in wait in its lair... until it reaches the station of the mature lion, when it goes out upon its prey"). He sees Saul as combining both predatory modes—sometimes ambushing (like the young lion), sometimes pursuing openly (like the mature lion).

The phrase יֹשֵׁב בְּמִסְתָּרִֽים (sitting/lurking in secret places) from the root סתר (hide, conceal) creates the hunting ambush scenario. Lamentations 3:10 uses the same image for God as antagonist: "דֹּב אֹרֵב הוּא לִי אַרְיֵה בְּמִסְתָּרִֽים" ("He is a lurking bear to me, a lion in hiding"). The parallel with Lamentations suggests the psalm taps into a standard metaphorical repertoire for describing hidden threat.

Lion imagery appears 11 times in Psalms (7:3, 10:9, 17:12, 22:14, 22:22, 34:11, 35:17, 57:5, 58:7, 91:13, 104:21), predominantly in lament contexts where the righteous sufferer faces predatory enemies. The figurative language database shows that across Scripture, lions consistently represent: (1) military/political enemies (Jeremiah 5:6, Ezekiel 19:2-9), (2) death itself (Job 4:10-11), or (3) occasionally, God's judgment (Isaiah 38:13, Hosea 5:14). In Psalm 17, the lion clearly represents human enemies, but the intensity of the imagery—the yearning to tear—suggests these enemies are more than merely political rivals. They embody existential threat, the force of chaos seeking to devour righteous order.

## Verse 13

קוּמָה יְהוָה, קַדְּמָה פָנָיו הַכְרִיעֵהוּ; פַּלְּטָה נַפְשִׁי מֵרָשָׁע חַרְבֶּֽךָ.

The psalm's accumulating tension explodes into a cascade of four rapid-fire imperatives directed at YHWH, each demanding immediate divine action. The opening קוּמָה (arise!) is the classic battle cry summoning God to war on behalf of His people. This imperative appears in the ancient liturgical formula preserved in Numbers 10:35: "וַיְהִי בִּנְסֹעַ הָאָרֹן וַיֹּאמֶר מֹשֶׁה קוּמָה יְהוָה וְיָפֻצוּ אֹיְבֶיךָ" ("When the ark set out, Moses said, 'Arise, O LORD, and let Your enemies be scattered'"). Psalm 44:27 uses it in communal lament: "קוּמָה עֶזְרָתָה לָּנוּ וּפְדֵנוּ לְמַעַן חַסְדֶּךָ" ("Arise, help us, and redeem us for Your steadfast love's sake"). The verb signals transition from passive observation to active intervention—God must *rise* from His throne and enter the fray.

The second imperative קַדְּמָה (confront, meet, anticipate) from the root qdm creates spatial imagery: God must *go before* or *get ahead of* the enemy, intercepting their advance. The phrase קַדְּמָה פָנָיו (confront his face) suggests face-to-face encounter—not attack from behind or ambush, but direct confrontation. Exodus 33:14-15 uses פָּנִים theologically: "פָּנַי יֵלֵכוּ וַהֲנִחֹתִי לָךְ... אִם־אֵין פָּנֶיךָ הֹלְכִים אַל־תַּעֲלֵנוּ מִזֶּה" ("My presence [lit. 'face'] will go [with you], and I will give you rest... If Your presence does not go, do not bring us up from here"). The psalmist asks that God's "face" meet the enemy's "face"—a collision of presences.

The third imperative הַכְרִיעֵהוּ (bring him to his knees, cause him to bow down, cast him down) from the root כרע employs the vocabulary of physical subjugation. The Hiphil form means "cause to bow/kneel"—force into submission. 2 Samuel 22:40 celebrates: "וַתַּזְרֵנִי חַיִל לַמִּלְחָמָה תַּכְרִיעַ קָמַי תַּחְתָּי" ("You equipped me with strength for battle; You made those who rise against me sink under me"). Isaiah 45:23 promises eschatological submission: "לִי תִּכְרַע כָּל־בֶּרֶךְ תִּשָּׁבַע כָּל־לָשׁוֹן" ("To Me every knee shall bow, every tongue swear"). Rashi glosses the verse: "קַפַּח אֶת רַגְלָיו וְיִכְרַע וְיִפּוֹל" ("Beat his legs so he kneels and falls")—a graphic image of violent takedown.

The fourth and climactic imperative פַּלְּטָה נַפְשִׁי (rescue my soul/life) from פלט (escape, deliver, rescue) shifts focus from enemy-destruction to self-preservation. The verb appears 25 times in Scripture, often in psalmic petitions. Psalm 7:2 uses it: "הוֹשִׁיעֵנִי מִכָּל־רֹדְפַי וְהַצִּילֵנִי" ("Deliver me from all my pursuers and save me"). Genesis 19:17 employs it in the angelic command to Lot: "הִמָּלֵט עַל־נַפְשֶׁךָ" ("Flee for your life!"). The psalmist's self-designation as נַפְשִׁי (my soul/life) underscores existential stakes—not merely reputation or comfort, but life itself hangs in balance.

The phrase מֵרָשָׁע חַרְבֶּךָ (from the wicked [who is] Your sword) creates a striking theological construction. Is חַרְבֶּךָ (Your sword) in apposition to רָשָׁע (the wicked one), making the enemy God's instrument? Or should it be read as two separate elements: "from the wicked" and "[by] Your sword"? The former reading—enemy-as-divine-sword—aligns with prophetic theology where foreign nations serve as God's punitive instruments. Isaiah 10:5 declares regarding Assyria: "הוֹי אַשּׁוּר שֵׁבֶט אַפִּי וּמַטֶּה־הוּא בְיָדָם זַעְמִי" ("Woe to Assyria, rod of My anger; the staff in their hand is My fury"). Radak explains: "מֵרָשָׁע שֶׁהוּא חַרְבְּךָ כְּמוֹ שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: הוֹי אַשּׁוּר שֵׁבֶט אַפִּי; כִּי הַחֶרֶב וְהַפְּלֵטָה מִמֶּנָּה מֵאִתְּךָ הוּא הַכֹּל" ("From the wicked who is Your sword, as it says 'Woe, Assyria, rod of My anger'; for the sword and deliverance from it—all is from You"). This reading paradoxically asks God to deliver the psalmist from God's own agent, implying that the wicked enemy, though currently serving divine purposes, has exceeded his mandate and must now be stopped.

## Verse 14

מִמְתִים יָדְךָ יְהוָה, מִמְתִים מֵחֶלֶד חֶלְקָם בַּחַיִּים; וּצְפוּנְךָ תְּמַלֵּא בִטְנָם, יִשְׂבְּעוּ בָנִים, וְהִנִּיחוּ יִתְרָם לְעוֹלְלֵיהֶֽם.

This is the psalm's most notorious interpretive crux, generating radically divergent readings across the centuries. The syntactic ambiguity centers on whether the verse describes the wicked's prosperity (creating contrast with v. 15) or petitions for God's "treasured ones" to be provided for. The uncertainty affects how we understand the psalm's theodicy and its vision of competing human flourishings.

The opening phrase מִמְתִים יָדְךָ יְהוָה (from mortals—Your hand, O LORD) is itself compressed and difficult. Most interpreters supply "deliver me": "[Deliver me] from mortals by Your hand, O LORD." The term מֵתִים (mortals, men, literally "dead ones" or "dying ones") derives from מוּת (die), emphasizing human transience. But the immediately following phrase מִמְתִים מֵחֶלֶד complicates matters—is this a second מִן phrase ("from men of fleeting existence") or something else? The term חֶלֶד appears only here and in Psalm 39:6: "אַךְ־בְּצֶלֶם יִתְהַלֶּךְ־אִישׁ אַךְ־הֶבֶל יֶהֱמָיוּן יִצְבֹּר וְלֹא־יֵדַע מִי־אֹסְפָם" ("Surely man walks about as a shadow; surely they are in turmoil for nothing; he heaps up wealth and does not know who will gather it"). The lexical meaning of חֶלֶד is disputed—"world"? "fleeting time"? "transience"?

Rashi offers a parsing that distinguishes two types of death: "מִן הַמֵּתִים בְּיָדְךָ עַל מִטָּתָם אֲנִי בּוֹחֵר לִהְיוֹת... וּמִן הַצַּדִּיקִים אֲשֶׁר חֶלְקָם בַּחַיִּים" ("From those who die by Your hand on their bed I choose to be... and from the righteous whose portion is in [eternal] life"). He reads מֵחֶלֶד as "from [after their] transient existence"—that is, distinguishing between types of death (natural vs. violent) and ultimately contrasting earthly "portion in [this] life" with eternal reward. But this reading requires substantial interpretive supplementation.

The Radak takes the dominant medieval view that this describes the *wicked's* prosperity: "חֶלְקָם הוּא בְּחַיֵּי הָעוֹלָם הַזֶּה, כִּי לֹא יִצְפּוּ לָעוֹלָם הַבָּא, אֶלָּא שֶׁצְּפוּנְךָ וְטוּבְךָ תְּמַלֵּא בִטְנָם בָּעוֹלָם הַזֶּה" ("Their portion is in the life of this world, for they do not hope for the world to come, but rather Your treasure and Your good fills their belly in this world"). This reading makes perfect sense of the inclusio created with verse 15: *they* are satisfied with children and inheritance (v. 14); *I* will be satisfied with beholding Your face (v. 15). The psalm thus contrasts two competing visions of human flourishing—material prosperity versus beatific vision.

The phrase וּצְפוּנְךָ תְּמַלֵּא בִטְנָם (and Your treasure fills their belly) is syntactically straightforward but theologically ambiguous. Is צָפוּן (treasure, hidden wealth) something *given* to them or something they *hoard*? Psalm 31:20 uses צָפַן for divine storing: "מָה רַב־טוּבְךָ אֲשֶׁר־צָפַנְתָּ לִּירֵאֶיךָ פָּעַלְתָּ לַחֹסִים בָּךְ נֶגֶד בְּנֵי אָדָם" ("How great is Your goodness that You have stored up for those who fear You"). If the wicked are in view, the irony is sharp: God's *stored-up* treasure—meant for the righteous—ends up filling *their* bellies because they seize earthly goods. Alternatively, if these are the righteous, then God providentially fills their needs.

The climactic pair יִשְׂבְּעוּ בָנִים, וְהִנִּיחוּ יִתְרָם לְעוֹלְלֵיהֶֽם (they are satisfied with children, and leave their abundance to their offspring) uses שׂבע (satisfy, fill to satiation), which will recur in verse 15: אֶשְׂבְּעָה בְהָקִיץ תְּמוּנָתֶךָ ("I will be satisfied, upon awakening, with Your likeness"). This lexical repetition creates the contrast's pivot point. Job 21:7-13 describes the wicked's prosperity in nearly identical terms: "מַדּוּעַ רְשָׁעִים יִחְיוּ... זַרְעָם נָכוֹן לִפְנֵיהֶם... יְכַלּוּ בַטּוֹב יְמֵיהֶם" ("Why do the wicked live on... their offspring are established before them... They spend their days in prosperity"). The biblical wisdom tradition wrestles consistently with this scandal: the wicked flourish materially while the righteous suffer.

The phrase עוֹלְלֵיהֶֽם (their young children, their infants) from the root עלל adds poignancy—not just children but *grandchildren*, implying dynasty-building across generations. This is the ultimate biblical measure of blessing: to see your children's children. Psalm 128:6 promises: "רְאֵה־בָנִים לְבָנֶיךָ שָׁלוֹם עַל־יִשְׂרָאֵל" ("May you see your children's children! Peace be upon Israel!"). Yet here, that blessing appears to accrue to those whose "portion is in [this] life"—those content with temporal prosperity.

The verse's ultimate interpretive key lies in its relationship to verse 15's climactic contrast. Whether the verse describes wicked prosperity or righteous provision, it sets up the radical theological assertion that follows: *neither* material abundance *nor* progeny can compare to the ultimate satisfaction of beholding God's face. The psalmist, unlike Job who argues for proportional justice, transcends the category of fair distribution altogether by positing a different order of good.

## Verse 15

אֲנִי בְּצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ; אֶשְׂבְּעָה בְהָקִיץ תְּמוּנָתֶֽךָ.

The psalm reaches its theological crescendo with this verse, which transforms personal lament into mystical manifesto. The emphatic pronoun אֲנִי (I) frontloads the colon, creating sharp contrast with the implicit "they" of verse 14: *they* may have full bellies and abundant children, but *I* have something infinitely more precious. The phrase בְּצֶדֶק (in righteousness) creates an inclusio with the opening צֶדֶק of verse 1, framing the entire psalm with the theme of moral integrity as prerequisite for divine encounter. But צֶדֶק here may function causally (because of righteousness), instrumentally (by means of righteousness), or qualitatively (in a righteous manner)—each reading enriching the claim that ethical purity enables mystical vision.

The verb אֶחֱזֶה (I will behold) from חזה is theologically loaded. This is not the common verb רָאָה (see) but rather חָזָה, which carries connotations of prophetic vision and penetrating insight. It's the verb used for Moses's unique vision in Numbers 12:8: "תְּמֻנַת יְהוָה יַבִּיט" ("[He] beholds the form of the LORD"), establishing the terminus technicus for direct divine vision. Job 19:26 uses it eschatologically: "וּמִבְּשָׂרִי אֶחֱזֶה אֱלוֹהַּ" ("yet from my flesh I shall behold God"). Isaiah 33:17 promises future theophany: "מֶלֶךְ בְּיָפְיוֹ תֶּחֱזֶינָה עֵינֶיךָ" ("Your eyes will behold the King in His beauty"). The verb thus signals not casual observation but privileged, revelatory seeing.

The object פָנֶיךָ (Your face) is the psalm's climactic image. Throughout Scripture, "seeing God's face" is both the ultimate desire and an impossibility. Exodus 33:20 declares: "לֹא תוּכַל לִרְאֹת אֶת־פָּנָי כִּי לֹא־יִרְאַנִי הָאָדָם וָחָי" ("You cannot see My face, for man shall not see Me and live"). Yet Moses uniquely speaks with God "פָּנִים אֶל־פָּנִים" (face to face, Exodus 33:11). Psalm 27:8-9 voices the soul's deepest longing: "לְךָ אָמַר לִבִּי בַּקְּשׁוּ פָנָי אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ יְהוָה אֲבַקֵּשׁ. אַל־תַּסְתֵּר פָּנֶיךָ מִמֶּנִּי" ("My heart said to You, 'Seek My face.' Your face, LORD, I will seek. Do not hide Your face from me"). The "face of God" throughout Psalms oscillates between metaphor for divine presence/favor and literal theophanic encounter.

The parallel colon employs the same satisfaction vocabulary (שׂבע) used in verse 14 but redirects it entirely: אֶשְׂבְּעָה בְהָקִיץ תְּמוּנָתֶֽךָ (I will be satisfied, upon awakening, with Your likeness). The verb אֶשְׂבְּעָה (I will be satisfied) echoes verse 14's יִשְׂבְּעוּ בָנִים (they are satisfied with children), creating explicit contrast: *their* satisfaction is children and wealth; *my* satisfaction is the divine form. The phrase בְהָקִיץ (upon awakening, when I awake) has generated multiple interpretations across millennia:

1. **Literal temple incubation**: The psalmist has spent the night in the sanctuary (explaining פָקַדְתָּ לַיְלָה, "You visited [me] by night," v. 3) and anticipates awakening to see God's form/glory manifest in the Temple. Ancient Near Eastern incubation practices, where suppliants slept in sanctuaries awaiting divine dreams or oracles, support this reading.

2. **Eschatological awakening**: The "awakening" is from death—proto-resurrection hope. Daniel 12:2 uses identical vocabulary: "וְרַבִּים מִיְּשֵׁנֵי אַדְמַת־עָפָר יָקִיצוּ" ("Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake"). Job 19:25-27 similarly anticipates post-mortem divine vision: "וְאַחַר עוֹרִי נִקְּפוּ־זֹאת וּמִבְּשָׂרִי אֶחֱזֶה אֱלוֹהַּ" ("After my skin has been thus destroyed, yet from my flesh I shall behold God").

3. **Spiritual awakening**: Morning as metaphor for enlightenment or deliverance from distress. Psalm 30:6 uses night/morning dialectically: "בָּעֶרֶב יָלִין בֶּכִי וְלַבֹּקֶר רִנָּה" ("Weeping may tarry for the night, but joy comes in the morning").

The Radak synthesizes views: "אֲנִי מְצַפֶּה וּמְיַחֵל לַחֲזוֹת פָּנֶיךָ לָעוֹלָם הַבָּא... כִּי לֹא תָמוּת וְתִישַׁן נַפְשִׁי" ("I am looking forward and hoping to behold Your face in the world to come... for my soul will not die and sleep"). The Malbim distinguishes between this-worldly and eschatological satisfaction: "אֲנִי אֵינִי שָׂבֵעַ בָּעוֹלָם הַזֶּה לֹא שְׂבִיעַת הַבֶּטֶן וְלֹא שְׂבִיעַת הַבָּנִים... רַק אָז אֶשְׂבְּעָה עֵת יָקִיץ תְּמוּנָתְךָ" ("I am not satisfied in this world, neither with satiety of belly nor of children... but then I will be satisfied when Your form awakens").

The term תְּמוּנָה (form, likeness, semblance) is extraordinarily rare, appearing elsewhere only in Numbers 12:8 (Moses seeing God's תְּמֻנָה), Job 4:16 (a spirit-form in Eliphaz's vision), and Deuteronomy 4:12-16 (warning against idolatry because Israel "saw no form" at Sinai). The word derives from the root מנה (count, number, appoint) but has developed into designating visible shape or form. Numbers 12:8's usage is crucial: God distinguishes Moses from other prophets precisely by granting him vision of the divine תְּמוּנָה—"וּתְמֻנַת יְהוָה יַבִּיט" ("and he beholds the form of the LORD"). The psalmist thus claims Mosaic-level access to divine presence.

Ibn Ezra spiritualizes: "וּטְעַם לְהַכִּיר מַעֲשֵׂה הַשֵּׁם כִּי הֵם כֻּלָּם כְּלָלִים וּבְחָכְמָה עֲשׂוּיִים וּלְנֶצַח עוֹמְדִים, וַאֲנִי שָׂבֵעַ מֵהִתְעַנֵּג בְּתְמוּנָתְךָ... וְזֹאת הַמַּחֲזֶה אֵינָהּ בִּמְרָאֵה הָעַיִן רַק בִּמְרָאֵה שְׁקוֹל הַדַּעַת" ("The meaning is to recognize God's works, for they are all comprehensive and made with wisdom and stand forever, and I am satisfied with delighting in Your form... This vision is not with the eye's sight but with the sight of intellectual contemplation"). He transforms theophany into philosophical knowledge of God through creation.

But the verse's power lies precisely in its refusal of such spiritualization. It claims *vision*—the verb חזה, the noun תְּמוּנָה, the direct object פָּנֶיךָ—and satisfaction not with abstract knowledge but with *beholding*. This is the psalm's radical answer to theodicy: Why do the wicked prosper? Because their "portion is in [this] life" (v. 14), and there exists a different order of good altogether—not more of the same kind (wealth, progeny) but a categorically different satisfaction: seeing God's very form. The psalmist opts out of the justice debate (do I receive proportional reward?) to assert a transcendent telos: the righteous inherit not justice but *God himself*.

Liturgically, this verse appears in the Sefard Birkat Kohanim, where congregants respond to the priestly blessing with verses expressing longing for divine face. The liturgy quotes: "אַל תַּסְתֵּר פָּנֶיךָ מִמֶּנִי... אֲנִי בְּצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ אֶשְׂבְּעָה בְהָקִיץ תְּמוּנָתֶךָ" ("Do not hide Your face from me... As for me, in righteousness I will behold Your face; I will be satisfied upon awakening with Your likeness"). This transforms the priestly pronouncement יָאֵר יְהוָה פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ ("May the LORD make His face shine upon you") into reciprocal aspiration—not merely that God's face shine *upon* us, but that we behold His face *directly*. The verse also appears in the piyyut "Bar Yochai Hashem Imcha" for Lag Ba'Omer, associated with Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai's mystical attainments: "בִּינָה סוֹד עוֹלָם הַבָּא שָׁמָּה... בְּצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ" ("Understanding [Binah], the secret of the world to come... in righteousness I shall behold Your face"), linking the psalm's vision to Kabbalistic Sefirot and mystical ascent. Thus the verse moves from individual lament to communal liturgy to esoteric mysticism—a trajectory mirroring the psalm's own movement from legal plea to beatific vision.
