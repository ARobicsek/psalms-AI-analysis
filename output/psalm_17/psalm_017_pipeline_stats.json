      "How does 'seeing God's face' (אחזה פניך, v. 15) relate to temple entrance liturgies, theophany traditions, and prohibitions against seeing God (Exod 33:20)? What is the theological development of 'face of God' language in the Psalter?",

      "What is the syntactic and theological function of v. 14—are the 'treasured ones' whose bellies are filled the wicked (describing their prosperity) or the righteous (petition for their provision)? How does this affect the contrast with v. 15?",
      "What is the meaning of חֶלֶד (v. 14, translated 'fleeting')—is this temporal ('momentary life'), spatial ('world'), or qualitative ('transient existence')? Lexical study needed comparing other uses.",
      "How does the protestation of innocence (vv. 3-5) compare to ANE legal oaths, Job's self-imprecations (Job 31), and temple entrance requirements (Psalms 15, 24)? What level of righteousness is being claimed?",
      "What is the textual issue in v. 4 (לפעלות אדם בדבר שפתיך אני שמרתי ארחות פריץ), and how do different translations affect the meaning? Does the psalmist claim to have avoided or observed the paths of the violent?",
      "How does the shift from plural enemies (vv. 9-11) to singular enemy in lion metaphor (v. 12) function rhetorically? Is this poetic variation, or does the singular represent archetypal evil?",
      "What is the relationship between Psalm 17 and Psalm 16 (which also emphasizes God as 'portion' and presence over material goods) and Psalm 73 (which resolves theodicy through sanctuary vision)? Are these a theological cluster?",
      "How does the 'apple of the eye' metaphor (אישון בת־עין, v. 8) function across biblical literature (Deut 32:10, Prov 7:2, Zech 2:8), and what is the etymology of this peculiar phrase?"

    "micro_questions": [
      "Why does the psalmist use the unusual construction 'hear righteousness/justice' (שִׁמְעָה צֶדֶק) rather than 'hear my righteous cause' - is צֶדֶק personified or functioning as object of hearing?",
      "What is the precise cultic-theological significance of 'night visitation' (פָּקַדְתָּ לַּיְלָה, v. 3) - does this indicate an actual temple incubation practice where suppliants slept in sanctuary awaiting divine revelation?",
      "How should the notoriously difficult verse 4 be parsed syntactically - does 'I have kept paths of the violent' mean observation or avoidance, and why is this verse so grammatically ambiguous?",
      "What accounts for the extraordinary double metaphor in v. 8 (pupil of eye AND shadow of wings) - are these complementary protective images, or do they represent different aspects of divine care (individual vs. communal, micro vs. macro)?",
      "Is the phrase 'their fat they have closed' (חֶלְבָּמוֹ סָּגְרוּ, v. 10) a Hebrew idiom for hard-heartedness, or does it relate to prosperity/satiety as moral failing?",
      "Why does the psalm shift from plural enemies (vv. 9-11) to singular enemy in the lion metaphor (v. 12) - is this poetic variation, focusing rhetoric on archetypal threat, or indicating a primary antagonist?",
      "What is the meaning of the obscure phrase 'from men of חֶלֶד' (v. 14) - is חֶלֶד temporal (fleeting/transient), spatial (world), or qualitative (perishing/mortal)?",
      "WHO is being described in v. 14 - is this the wicked's earthly prosperity (setting up contrast) or petition for provision of 'your treasured ones' - and how does the answer affect the psalm's theology?",
      "How can the psalmist claim to behold God's תְּמוּנָה (form/likeness, v. 15) when this word is used only for Moses's unique vision (Num 12:8) and Exodus 33:20 says no one can see God's face and live?",
      "What is the referent of 'awakening' (בְּהָקִיץ, v. 15) - literal morning after temple night vigil, metaphorical spiritual awakening, or proto-resurrection hope (cf. Dan 12:2)?",
      "How does the 'satisfaction' vocabulary (שׂבע) function contrastively between v. 14 (they are satisfied with earthly things) and v. 15 (I will be satisfied with God's form) - is this the theological heart of the psalm's theodicy answer?",
      "Does the 'shadow of wings' (צֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ, v. 8) refer to protective bird imagery, temple cherubim overshadowing the ark, or a deliberate fusion of natural and cultic metaphors?",
      "Why does the LXX consistently diverge from MT in interpretive choices (especially vv. 4, 14) - do these variations reveal ancient exegetical struggles with the Hebrew text or represent distinct theological traditions?"
