### 1. What kind of psalm is this?

Psalm 17 opens like someone pounding on the door of a courtroom, not like a quiet “Dear Diary” prayer:

> תְּפִלָּ֗ה לְדָוִד; **שִׁמְעָ֤ה יְהוָה ׀ צֶדֶק**  
> A prayer of David. **Hear, O LORD, [what is] right**…

The speaker fires off three imperatives in a row:

- **שִׁמְעָה** (*shimʿah*) – “hear”
- **הַקְשִׁיבָה** (*haqshivah*) – “pay close attention”
- **הַאֲזִינָה** (*ha’azinah*) – “give ear”

That repetition at the start of successive lines is called **anaphora**—a rhetorical technique where you hammer the same opening word to build urgency.

Even more striking: he doesn’t say, “Hear *me*,” but “Hear **צֶדֶק** (*tzedek*, ‘justice, what is right’).” He claims that his case and “Justice” itself are on the same side. This psalm is a **legal complaint**—a “prayer of the accused” who insists he’s innocent and asks God, as the ultimate judge, to overrule human courts.

Verse 2 makes that explicit:

> **מִלְּפָנֶיךָ מִשְׁפָּטִי יֵצֵא; עֵינֶיךָ תֶּחֱזֶינָה מֵישָׁרִים.**  
> “From Your presence let my judgment go forth; may Your eyes behold what is right.”

Here **מִשְׁפָּט** (*mishpat*, “judgment, verdict”) is the court decision, and “Your eyes” are God’s power to see the truth of a situation. The whole psalm lives in that courtroom atmosphere: testing evidence, cross‑examining motives, and finally announcing a verdict.

### 2. The story under the poem

The superscription says “A prayer of David” (*תְּפִלָּה לְדָוִד*). We can’t prove which episode in David’s life this goes with, but the details fit nicely with the “fugitive David” stories in 1 Samuel 23–26:

- He is **surrounded** (*יַקִּיפוּ עָלַי*, v.9; *סְבָבֻנוּ*, v.11).
- His enemies are **hunting** him like a lion waiting in ambush (v.12).
- He insists he did **not** take “the paths of the violent” (*אֹרְחוֹת פָּרִיץ*, v.4)—which sounds a lot like David refusing to assassinate Saul when he had the chance (1 Sam 24, 26).

So one way to “hear” the psalm is: David, hiding in caves, saying, “I played by Your rules. I didn’t take shortcuts. Now I’m boxed in by people who did. You, God, are my last court of appeal.”

Whether or not you buy that historical setting, it captures the emotional situation: someone who really has tried to do the right thing, and now feels that doing the right thing is going to get him killed.

### 3. The shape of the poem: a mirror with wings in the middle

Biblical poets often arrange ideas in **chiastic** patterns—a fancy word (from the Greek letter Chi, X) for a mirror structure like A–B–C–B′–A′. The central element (C) is usually the heart of the poem.

Psalm 17 looks like this:

- **A (vv.1–2)** – “Hear my just cause; let my verdict come from You.”
- **B (vv.3–5)** – “You’ve tested me; I’ve avoided violent paths; my feet haven’t slipped.”
- **C (vv.6–9)** – “Show Your *ḥesed*—Your covenant love—in a wondrous way; guard me as the apple of Your eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings.”
- **B′ (vv.10–12)** – “They’ve hardened themselves; their mouth speaks arrogance; he’s like a lion eager to tear.”
- **A′ (vv.13–15)** – “Arise, LORD… deliver me from the wicked… As for me, in righteousness I shall behold Your face.”

So the poem moves like this:

> Courtroom appeal → “My integrity” → **Center: Your protective love** → “Their violence” → Courtroom verdict.

The center (vv.6–9) shifts the whole tone from legal argument to intimacy: **eye**, **wings**, **shadow**, **hiding**. The psalmist doesn’t just want a favorable ruling; he wants to be so close to God that hurting him would be like poking God in the pupil.

### 4. Competing ideas of “the good life”

The sharpest contrast comes at the end between **v.14** and **v.15**. Verse 14 describes a certain kind of person:

> **מִמְתִים מֵחֶלֶד, חֶלְקָם בַּחַיִּים; וּצְפוּנְךָ תְּמַלֵּא בִטְנָם; יִשְׂבְּעוּ בָנִים וְהִנִּיחוּ יִתְרָם לְעוֹלְלֵיהֶם.**  
> “From mortals, from those of the fleeting world, whose **portion** is in this life.  
> With Your (hidden) treasure You fill their belly.  
> They are **satisfied** with children, and leave their surplus to their little ones.”

Key words:

- **חֶלֶד** (*cheled*) – a rare word for the “world” as a **short lifespan**, a fleeting world.
- **חֵלֶק** (*cheleq*, “portion, share”) – what you get handed as your lot.
- **יִשְׂבְּעוּ** (*yisbeʿu*, “they are satisfied, full”) – from the root *שׂבע*, to be filled or sated.

These people get exactly what most ancient Israelites (and, honestly, most of us) would call success: full stomachs, lots of kids, enough wealth to leave the grandkids an inheritance. If you stopped reading at v.14, you might assume *they* are the blessed ones.

But verse 15 begins with a strong contrastive **אֲנִי** (*ani*, “As for me”):

> **אֲנִי בְּצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ; אֶשְׂבְּעָה בְהָקִיץ תְּמוּנָתֶךָ.**  
> “But as for me, in righteousness I shall behold Your face;  
> I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Your likeness.”

Same satisfaction verb—*אֶשְׂבְּעָה* (*esbeʿah*, “I shall be satisfied”)—but a completely different object:

- **They** are sated with **belly** and **children**.
- **He** will be sated with **God’s face** and **likeness**.

That’s the psalm’s big “value argument.” There are two ways to define the “good life”: one measured by what goes into your stomach and down your family tree, the other measured by how close you come to seeing God.

### 5. Seeing and being seen

Notice how much eyesight language there is:

- God’s **eyes** see what is right: “**עֵינֶיךָ תֶּחֱזֶינָה מֵישָׁרִים** – Your eyes will behold what is upright” (v.2).
- The psalmist asks: “Guard me **as the apple of the eye**”—**כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת־עָיִן** (v.8).  
  *אִישׁוֹן* (*ishon*) is the “little man”—the tiny reflection you see in someone’s pupil. *בַּת־עַיִן* (*bat‑ayin*, “daughter of the eye”) is another idiom for the pupil. To be someone’s *ishon bat‑ayin* is to be exactly at the center of their gaze, the most protected spot on the body.
- The enemies’ **eyes** scan the ground, looking for traps to set: “**עֵינֵיהֶם יָשִׁיתוּ לִנְטוֹת בָּאָרֶץ** – Their eyes they set to spread out upon the land” (v.11).
- The climax: “**אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ** – I shall behold Your face” (v.15).

There’s some theological tension here. Elsewhere God says to Moses, “You cannot see My face, for no human can see Me and live” (Exod 33:20). Yet Numbers 12:8 says of Moses, “he beholds the **form** (*תְּמוּנָה*, *temunah*) of the LORD.” Our psalm dares to ask for something Moses‑like: “I will be satisfied with **Your temunah**” (v.15).

The phrase “when I awake” (*בְּהָקִיץ*, *b’hakitz*) appears again in Daniel 12:2: “Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall **awake** (*יָקִיצוּ*, *yakitzu*), some to everlasting life…” That’s why many Jewish commentators, like Rashi and Radak, read Psalm 17:15 as a hint of **resurrection**: after the “sleep” of death, the righteous will wake to see God.

Others, like Ibn Ezra, read it more philosophically: waking from the “sleep” of foolishness into a life of knowing God. Either way, the psalm’s end goal is not just not-dying—it’s *seeing*.

### 6. How later readers used this psalm

Jewish tradition leaned hard into the eschatological (“end of days”) reading. Rashi glosses, “I will be satisfied with the vision of Your likeness when the dead awaken from their sleep.” The verse is quoted in the Talmud (Bava Batra 10a): “A person who gives a coin to a poor man merits to receive the **face of the Shekhinah**,” and then our verse is brought: **אֲנִי בְּצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ**.

In synagogue liturgy, Psalm 17 shows up especially on days that feel like court: Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah. Sephardic communities recite the whole psalm on Yom Kippur morning; individual verses like “Guard me as the apple of the eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings” (v.8) and “As for me, in righteousness I shall behold Your face” (v.15) are woven into the daily priestly blessing (*Birkat Kohanim*).

Christian readers, especially Church Fathers like Augustine, saw Psalm 17 as the voice of Christ and as a key text for the **Beatific Vision**—the idea that ultimate human happiness is seeing God “face to face.”

For you, as a reader of biblical poetry, Psalm 17 is a brilliant workshop in how a relatively short poem can do all of this at once: stage a legal drama, sketch predators and wings and pupils, and then quietly end with one of the most daring sentences in the whole Bible.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

#### Full psalm

In the **Edot HaMizrach** (Middle Eastern) tradition, Psalm 17 is recited in full during the expanded **Pesukei DeZimra** (introductory psalms of praise) on **Yom Kippur morning (Shacharit)**. There it functions as a communal “prayer of the accused” on the Day of Judgment: the entire congregation adopts David’s language—“**שִׁמְעָה יְהוָה צֶדֶק** – Hear, O LORD, what is right” (17:1)—as they ask for a favorable verdict.

Some Eastern rites also weave Psalm 17 into the **Selichot** (penitential prayers) on Yom Kippur eve, using vv.1–3 to set a tone of honest self‑examination: God has “tested my heart… visited [me] at night” (17:3).

#### Key verses

1. **17:1 – שִׁמְעָה יְהוָה צֶדֶק הַקְשִׁיבָה רִנָּתִי**  
   “Hear, O LORD, [what is] right; give heed to my cry”

   - In **Ashkenazic Yom Kippur** liturgy, this line appears inside piyyutim (liturgical poems) during the **Chazzan’s Repetition** of the Amidah, strengthening the community’s plea that God listen to their case.
   - Sephardic Selichot before Rosh Hashanah use it in a call‑and‑response:  
     > **שְׁמַע יְהוָה קוֹלֵנוּ… שִׁמְעָה יְהוָה צֶדֶק הַקְשִׁיבָה רִנָּתֵנוּ**  
     > “Hear, O LORD, our voice… Hear, O LORD, what is right; give heed to our cry.”

2. **17:8 – שָׁמְרֵנִי כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת־עָיִן; בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנִי**  
   “Guard me as the apple of the eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings”

   - In many **Sephardic communities**, this whole verse is recited by the congregation during **Birkat Kohanim** (the priestly blessing). When the priests say “וְיִשְׁמְרֶךָ – and may He guard you,” the people answer:  
     > **שָׁמְרֵנִי כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת עָיִן, בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנִי.**  
   - The same verse appears in the **Seudah Reviʿit** (the “fourth meal” after Shabbat) in Eastern rites:  
     > **בְּכֹחַ סְגֻלָּתָהּ שָׁמְרֵנוּ כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת עָיִן, וּבְצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנוּ**  
     > “By the power of [Shabbat’s] special quality, guard us like the apple of the eye; hide us in the shadow of Your wings.”

3. **17:15 – אֲנִי בְּצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ…**  
   “As for me, in righteousness I shall behold Your face…”

   - In Sephardic **Birkat Kohanim**, when the priests say, “יָאֵר ה' פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ – May the LORD make His face shine upon you” (Num 6:25), the congregation responds:  
     > **אֲנִי בְּצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ; אֶשְׂבְּעָה בְהָקִיץ תְּמוּנָתֶךָ.**  
   - The piyyut **“Bar Yochai”**, sung especially on Lag BaOmer, ends one stanza with this phrase, applying it to Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai’s mystical insight.

#### Phrases

- **בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ – “in the shadow of Your wings” (17:8)**  
  This phrase reappears verbatim in Psalms 36:8, 57:2, and 63:8 and has migrated into many prayers. It becomes shorthand for God’s intimate protection—especially in times of transition, like the end of Shabbat and the Days of Awe.

- **נַפְשִׁי מֵרָשָׁע חַרְבֶּךָ – “my soul from the wicked, Your sword” (17:13)**  
  A variant of this line is woven into a special **El Maleh Rachamim** memorial prayer on the fast of 20 Sivan (for the 1648 massacres), turning David’s plea for rescue into a communal cry for justice for martyrs.
