**Verse 1**

“`Ashrei ha’ish asher lo halakh… lo ‘amad… lo yashav`.” The psalm’s first breath draws three boundary lines. The triple negation (`lo … lo … lo`) makes a verbal fence; the verbs form a staircase: walking (`halakh`), standing (`‘amad`), sitting (`yashav`). This is “staircase parallelism,” a poetic intensification where each step increases involvement—from movement alongside bad counsel to fixed company among those who scoff. The sound-work matters: `uv-derekh chata’im lo ‘amad u-v-moshav letsim lo yashav` strings sibilants (sh, s) and liquids (l) into a slowing cadence that feels, in the ear, like the brakes going on.

The three circles—`resha‘im` (wicked), `chata’im` (sinners), `letzim` (scoffers)—are not three species so much as three stations on a trajectory. In the wisdom tradition, the `lets` is a recognizably tragic figure: unteachable, allergic to reproof (Prov 9:7–8; 15:12). The verse’s order moves from thought-world to thoroughfare to fellowship: “counsel” (`‘etzah`), “path” (`derekh`), “seat” (`moshav`). The imagery is directional (cf. Deut 5:29–30; 8:6; the figurative database shows this path-metaphor is ubiquitous). By starting with what the righteous does not do, the poet follows a pattern found elsewhere in Psalms: “Turn from evil and do good” (Ps 34:15)—negation as preparation for positive desire.

A notable textual wrinkle lies in the ancient Greek translation (LXX), which renders “seat of scoffers” as “chair of pestilences” (ἐπὶ καθέδραν λοιμῶν). The Hebrew MT’s `letzim` becomes Greek “pestilences,” shifting from moral derision to infectious harm. This is not a different Hebrew reading so much as an interpretive move: derision spreads; it sickens a community. For our psalm’s logic, the effect is similar: the final station is a settled, corrosive belonging.

Traditional Jewish readers catch an ethical psychology here. Rashi calls the three negatives “a fence around a fence”—a set of guards before the heart is reached. Radak notes that `ashrei` is a plural form used as an exclamation (“How many felicities!”), suggesting that the happy life is cumulative. The line is precise without being pedantic: it does not catalogue sins; it describes drift. The poem will now pivot to desire.

Definitions: Staircase parallelism is a form of parallelism in which the second and third cola build sequentially on the first, often repeating a keyword while intensifying the action.

**Verse 2**

“`Ki im be-Torat YHWH chef’tso u-v-Torato yehgeh yomam va-laylah`.” The adversative `ki im` means “rather”: the righteous is not merely abstaining; he is aimed. The word `chefetz` (“delight,” “deep desire”) in BDB’s range covers “longing” and “precious thing.” The object is `Torat YHWH`, the LORD’s teaching—both instruction and story. The next clause inverts the phrasing: “and in his teaching (`Torato`) he `yehgeh` day and night.” Jewish tradition heard this inversion as a pedagogy of the heart: what begins as God’s becomes “his” through study. The effect is not ownership but internalization.

The key verb `yehgeh` requires a small excursion into biblical sound. It can mean to moan (Isa 38:14), to growl (Isa 31:4), to muse (Ps 63:7). It is used in Joshua 1:8 for the same practice: recitation “day and night.” In other words, ancient study was voiced; the Psalmist’s righteous person is not silently perusing a page but murmuring. The merism “day and night” names a totality. It does not mandate nonstop reading; it signals orientation.

The psalm’s literary art serves this theology. The movement from “Torah of YHWH” to “his Torah” is a controlled inversion (not a full chiasm), binding revelation to habit. Phonetically, `be-Torat YHWH … u-v-Torato yehgeh` binds God’s name (`YHWH`) and “his Torah” (`Torato`) in a pleasing echo that points to their union in practice. In the economy of the poem, verse 2 is the hinge: it answers the three negatives with a single positive desire.

Parallels: Psalm 63:7 (“I remember you on my bed; I `ehgeh` of you in the night watches”) shows `hgh` used for meditative, often audible recollection; Psalm 77:13 similarly. By citing these, the verse participates in a broader biblical repertoire of embodied contemplation.

Definitions: Merism names a totality by citing its extremes (“day and night”). 

**Verse 3**

“`Ve-hayah ke‘ets shatoul ‘al-palgei mayim…`.” The righteous is “like a tree”—a simile, explicit in Hebrew with `ke-` (“like”). But the diction is exact: the tree is not simply planted; it is `shatoul`, “transplanted” (BDB; cf. Jer 17:8; Ezek 17:22–23; 19:10; Ps 92:14). Transplanting implies intention: someone chose the spot. The location is `‘al-palgei mayim`, “beside channels of water.” The noun `peleg` means a division; these are irrigation cuts rather than a single river. The righteous is not lucky to be near a stream; he is placed where provision runs. The figurative language database confirms this water imagery elsewhere marks divine abundance: “river whose streams gladden God’s city” (Ps 46:5); “the stream of your delights” (Ps 36:9).

The description proceeds in three phrases: fruit “in its time” (`be‘itto`), unfading leaf (`lo yibbol`), and comprehensive thriving (`ve-khol asher ya‘aseh yatzliach`). Each carries weight. “In its time” rebukes a culture of constant harvest; the righteous life is seasonal and reliable, not frenetic. “Leaf does not wither” answers the climate of drought. The final line steps beyond botany: the metaphor expands to the whole of life. The verb `yatzliach` (“prosper”) is the ordinary biblical verb of success (e.g., Gen 39:3), and in wisdom tradition it signals alignment with God’s order, not mere material gain.

Two small textual notes sharpen the reading. First, the linkage to Jeremiah 17:8 is not accidental. Jeremiah uses the same verb (`shatul`) and similar wording to portray the one who trusts in YHWH: “He shall be like a tree transplanted by the water… and in a year of drought he is not anxious.” The Psalmist is not naïve about weather. Second, classical Jewish interpreters press the imagery to its edges. Rashi famously remarks that even the “leaf” of the scholar—his casual conversation—yields instruction; the point is not pedantic but poetic: perennial vitality.

The music of the line is calm: long vowels in `shatoul` and `palgei` and the gentle cadence of `be‘itto … lo yibbol` mimic steadiness. The imagery, while ancient near Eastern in its fondness for cosmic trees, is democratized here: not a king but anyone rooted by Torah can have this life.

Definitions: Simile is an explicit comparison (“like/as”); metaphor is implicit (“A is B”).

**Verse 4**

“`Lo khen haresha‘im ki im ka-motz asher tidpennu ruach`.” After three lines of luxuriant growth, the poem gives the wicked four words. The abrupt `lo khen` (“not so”) cuts the scene. The wicked are “like chaff” (`motz`)—the lightest husk separated at threshing, more insubstantial than `qash` (stubble). The verb `tidpennu` (from `nadaph`, “drive away”) is vigorous; the wind does not merely lift; it “drives.” And the `ruach` (“wind,” “spirit”) lacks a definite article: any breeze suffices. The brevity is itself an argument: evil is not worth a paragraph.

This image is common. “Let them be like chaff before the wind” (Ps 35:5); “the nations rage … like chaff before the wind” (Isa 17:13); “they shall be like morning clouds, like chaff” (Hos 13:3). The pattern is consistent: chaff marks fragility and disposability, especially under divine judgment. Psalm 1’s distinctive use is to frame this as a moral physics lesson, not a courtroom sentence: what lacks root cannot last. 

The LXX chooses χνοῦς (“fine dust”) for `motz`, intensifying the sense of pulverized worthlessness. That translation, like the MT’s `motz`, is agricultural: when the winnowing fork is raised, there is a natural separation of grain and chaff. Ibn Ezra makes that point explicitly: the righteous are like grain, the wicked like straw. The verse’s grammar mirrors the act: a clipped sentence, a driven cadence.

**Verse 5**

“`‘Al-ken lo yaqumu resha‘im ba-mishpat ve-chata’im ba‘adat tzaddiqim`.” “Therefore” connects field and court. “Will not stand in the judgment” uses a legal idiom: to “stand” (`qum`) in judgment is to hold up under scrutiny, to have one’s case established (cf. Deut 19:15, where a “matter stands” on two witnesses; Ps 130:3, “If you kept iniquities, who could stand?”; Mal 3:2). The wicked cannot. Nor will “sinners” belong in the `‘edah` (“assembly”) of the righteous. Here the psalm turns from individuals to a community. In Priestly texts, `‘edah` is Israel gathered by appointment (e.g., Exod 12:3; Num 16). Psalm 1’s claim is quiet and profound: righteousness coheres; it builds an `‘edah`. Wickedness disperses (v. 4), and so it cannot constitute a stable congregation.

Ibn Ezra hears “they will not stand” as “they will not endure”—a fair gloss of the idiom and consistent with the poem’s emphasis on durability. Malbim draws a helpful distinction: even where a sinner might make a case “before himself” (appealing to human frailty), he cannot stand in the congregation measured by the lives of those who mastered their desires. That is not moral one‑upmanship; it is an observation about the weight of example.

The LXX’s rendering is again instructive: “therefore the ungodly will not rise in judgment, nor sinners in the council of the righteous” (ἐν βουλῇ δικαίων). “Council” (βουλή) emphasizes deliberation; the MT’s “assembly” underscores belonging. The direction is the same: those without weight cannot weigh in. The verse’s parallelism is antithetic and synthetic: it both contrasts (wicked vs. righteous) and builds (individual standing → communal membership).

Definitions: Antithetic parallelism sets one line against another; synthetic parallelism builds the thought forward. 

**Verse 6**

“`Ki yodea‘ YHWH derekh tzaddiqim ve-derekh resha‘im toved`.” The poem closes with an inclusio: it began with movement on a path; it ends with the fate of roads. “YHWH `yodea` the way of the righteous.” In Hebrew, `yada‘` (to know) often connotes attentive regard, covenantal recognition (Exod 2:25; Amos 3:2; Ps 37:18). To say God “knows” the righteous path is to say it is under divine attention and care. The second colon is strikingly different: the wicked path “perishes” (`toved`). There is no explicit divine subject; no bolt from the blue. The way collapses under its own design.

Two grammatical observations sharpen the point. First, `derekh resha‘im` is singular: many walkers, one road. Vice is often varied; its outcome is unoriginal. Second, the assonance of `yodea‘` (long “o,” broad vowels) gives weight to the first clause; the clipped `toved` ends with a hard stop—sound mirroring sense. The LXX echoes this antithesis: “the Lord knows the way of the righteous, and the way of the ungodly will perish” (ὁδὸς ἀσεβῶν ἀπολεῖται).

The verse answers the question of v. 5: What becomes of the “assembly of the righteous”? It is known, and so sustained. The “assembly” is not only a present social fact but a path God regards. Conversely, the “way of the wicked” does not simply lack blessing; it is doomed by design. Psalm 1 is not selling optimism; it is stating an ontology: in a world ordered by God, rootedness lasts and chaff does not.

Parallels: Psalm 37:18 uses the same verb for divine knowing: “YHWH knows the days of the blameless.” There too, knowing implies keeping.

Definitions: Inclusio is a framing device (here, the “way” at beginning and end). The MT (Masoretic Text) is our standard Hebrew; the LXX (Septuagint) is an ancient Greek translation that often interprets as it translates.
