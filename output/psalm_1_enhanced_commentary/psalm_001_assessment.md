# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 1

The current draft has real strengths. It sees Psalm 1 as architectural, not anecdotal; it rightly highlights the psalm’s “two ways” structure, the negative/positive pivot in verse 2, and the extended arboreal simile that anchors the poem. It makes good use of the verbs `halakh` → `‘amad` → `yashav`, and the attention to `yehgeh` as audible study is both philologically sound and vivid. The asymmetry between tree and chaff is perceptively read as theology by way of poetics.

Still, several revisions are needed. The essay sometimes over-asserts (e.g., Ancient Near Eastern legal “escalating verbs”) where the safer and more useful label is “staircase parallelism” (a poetic intensification). “Chiastic” in v. 2 is overstated; the effect is inversion rather than a full chiastic structure. The post-exilic dating is presented too confidently, overlooking the clear intertext with Joshua 1:8 (“meditate day and night”), which points to broader horizons. BDB is invoked, but not always carefully; better to let Proverbs’ usage of `letzim` carry the point (the mocker as discipline-proof) than to claim a specialized definition the lexicon does not itself press. 

Missed opportunities: 
- Engage the Septuagint (LXX), which in v. 1 famously renders “seat of scoffers” as “seat of pestilence” (λοιμῶν), reframing moral contagion as literal contagion; and in v. 4 uses χνοῦς (“fine dust”) rather than chaff. These are interpretive choices worth noting for a lay reader. 
- Use concordance data to situate `shatoul` with Jeremiah 17:8 and Ezekiel 17:22–23; and to set `yehgeh` alongside Joshua 1:8 and Psalm 63:7.
- Exploit sound: the sibilants of “`uv-moshav letsim lo yashav`” and the percussive `tidpennu ruach` reinforce the poem’s logic.
- Name and define core terms (inclusio, merism, colon, MT/LXX/BDB), and do so in clean, non-jargony prose.

The verse notes are solid but could probe further: the legal “stand” metaphor in v. 5 (Deut 19:15; Ps 130:3), the singular “way” in v. 6 as a communal road rather than isolated tracks, and the contrast between irrigated channels (`palgei mayim`) and “any wind” (`ruach` without article) as a study in stability versus volatility. With these adjustments, the commentary will move from strong to exemplary: philologically exact, literarily alert, and genuinely illuminating.
