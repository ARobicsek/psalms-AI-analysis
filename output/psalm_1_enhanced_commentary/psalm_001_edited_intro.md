At the threshold of Israel’s prayer book, we do not find a prayer. Psalm 1 opens with a map. It sketches a world divided not by tribe or temperament but by two roads that run through every life. One road is paced by counsel, path, and seat; the other by delight, murmuring, and root. The poem is brief, the vision broad. Everything that follows in the Psalter—lament and doxology, desperation and praise—will be heard within the acoustics of this first psalm’s choice.

The opening word, `ashrei`—“happy,” “flourishing,” “fortunate”—is a fixed Hebrew idiom formed from a plural noun used as an exclamation. Classical Jewish readers (Radak among them) noticed the plurality: happiness is not a single spike of luck but an accumulation of goods. The person envisioned here—note the generic “the man” (`ha’ish`), a type rather than a name—begins by not doing three things. He does not walk in wicked counsel, does not stand in the path of sinners, does not sit in the seat of scoffers. The verbs form a staircase—movement, then stance, then settled belonging. Staircase parallelism (a poetic form where each step builds or intensifies the previous one) traces the moral drift from brief exposure to full residence.

Listen to the line: `…uv-derekh chata’im lo ‘amad u-v-moshav letsim lo yashav.` The recurring sibilants (sh, s) slow the cadence, and the repeated negatives (`lo … lo … lo`) create a protective fence of language. The last noun, `letzim` (scoffers), deserves special attention. In Proverbs, the `lets` is not the class clown but the person for whom correction is pointless (Prov 9:7–8; 15:12); mockery has hardened into a stance. Interesting, then, that the Greek translators (LXX) render “seat of scoffers” as “seat of pestilences” (ἐπὶ καθέδραν λοιμῶν), hearing moral derision as social contagion. The Hebrew text (the MT, or Masoretic Text) pictures a circle of insolence; the Greek hears a quarantine ward.

If verse 1 builds fences, verse 2 opens a garden gate. The adversative `ki im` is best rendered “rather.” “Rather, in the teaching of the LORD (`Torat YHWH`) is his `chefetz`—his deep desire—and in his teaching he `yehgeh` day and night.” Two features matter here. First, the phrase shifts from “the LORD’s teaching” to “his teaching.” Ancient Jewish readers heard a progression: at first Torah is God’s; through labor and love, it becomes “his”—internalized rather than owned. The effect is inversion rather than a full chiasm (a mirror structure), but the point is sharp: revelation does not stay external. Second, `yehgeh` is a verb with throat. Lions “growl” (`yehgeh`) over prey (Isa 31:4); mourning doves “moan” (`hegeh`) (Isa 38:14). Here, as in Joshua 1:8, it names the old discipline of audible study: low, persistent recitation that engages breath, ear, and memory. “Day and night” is a merism (a totality suggested by naming extremes); not “without rest” but “as the rhythm of life.”

The tree in verse 3 is not simply planted; it is `shatoul`—transplanted—by `palgei mayim`, channels of water. The noun `peleg` means a division or branch; `palgei mayim` are not wild rivers but directed runnels—irrigation. The righteous person is placed on purpose where water flows. This horticultural precision resonates with Jeremiah 17:8, which uses the same verb (`shatul`) and imagery to describe the one who trusts in YHWH, and with Ezekiel’s visions of choice plantings (Ezek 17:22–23; 19:10). The Psalmist’s tree yields fruit “in its season” and “its leaf does not wither”; the final line, “and in all he does he prospers,” expands the figure. The point is not nonstop fruiting but stability, reliability, an alignment with right seasons. Rootedness, not rush.

The contrast is surgical. “Not so the wicked,” says verse 4, and then: “rather, like chaff (`motz`) that the wind drives (`tidpennu`) away.” The Hebrew is as terse as winnowing: four words tell the whole fate. Farmers know this image: thresh and toss, and the chaff lifts, flutters, and is gone. The poet chooses `motz` (fine chaff) rather than `qash` (stubble), emphasizing lightness and waste. The verb is forceful: `tidpennu` (from `nadaph`) means “drive, push away.” Note the lack of a definite article on `ruach` (“wind”): any wind will do. Where the righteous tree sits over divided waters, the wicked are divided by the slightest air. Elsewhere, this imagery functions in prayer for judgment (Ps 35:5) or prophetic warning (Isa 17:13; Hos 13:3); here it is moral physics.

Verses 5–6 move from field to court. “Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment.” The idiom “stand in judgment” uses a legal metaphor: to stand is to “hold up,” to have one’s case established (cf. Deut 19:15; Ps 130:3; Mal 3:2). They cannot. Nor will sinners belong in the “assembly of the righteous” (`‘adat tzaddiqim`). The noun `‘edah` is the term Priestly texts use for Israel’s gathered community. Psalm 1 reminds us that righteousness is not only personal virtue; it is social adhesive. Chaff does not build a congregation.

The psalm ends by returning to the language of road: “For YHWH `yodea`—knows—the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked `toved`—perishes.” In Hebrew, to “know” can mean more than to register facts; it often carries the sense of attentive recognition, covenantal regard (Exod 2:25; Ps 37:18). God’s knowing is a kind of keeping. Note the singular: “the way of the wicked”—not their ways—perishes. Many walkers, one roadway; the path itself proves terminal. This is an inclusio (a literary “envelope”): the poem that opened with “counsel/path/seat” closes with “way,” framing all with a single image.

Does the psalm describe the world as we find it? Not every righteous person is an orchard; not every cruel man blows away. But Psalm 1 does not pretend to close our eyes to the unevenness of life. It sets the terms, not the statistics. It gives us a rule, and the rest of the Psalter will give us the exceptions—complaints from drought years, songs from floodplains. At the door, we are told how to walk.

Notes on terms:
- MT: the standard Hebrew text (Masoretic Text) preserved by medieval Jewish scribes.
- LXX: the ancient Greek translation (Septuagint), often interpretive and sometimes preserving a different underlying Hebrew.
- BDB: Brown–Driver–Briggs, a classic Hebrew lexicon.
- Merism: a figure naming two extremes to suggest a whole (“day and night” = always).
- Inclusio: framing a unit with the same motif at beginning and end.
- Colon: a single poetic line; Hebrew poetry commonly sets one colon in parallel with another.
