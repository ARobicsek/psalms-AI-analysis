## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (10)

1. What is the significance of the three-fold progression 'counsel→path→seat' in v. 1, and how does this relate to Ancient Near Eastern concepts of moral progression?
2. How does the tree imagery in v. 3 connect to Ancient Near Eastern and biblical traditions of the cosmic tree or tree of life?
3. What specific judicial or legal context is evoked by the language of 'standing in judgment' in v. 5?
4. How does the term 'way' (דרך) function in wisdom literature, and what theological implications does it carry?
5. What is the relationship between 'Torah of YHWH' and personal appropriation ('his Torah') in v. 2?
6. How does the chaff metaphor in v. 4 relate to other biblical and ANE uses of agricultural imagery for judgment?
7. What does YHWH's 'knowing' the way of the righteous imply about divine epistemology and covenantal relationship?
8. How do the temporal markers ('day and night,' 'in its season') contribute to the psalm's theology of divine timing?
9. What is the significance of the 'assembly of the righteous' in v. 5 for understanding community identity?
10. How does this psalm's binary worldview relate to other wisdom literature and the broader theology of the Psalter?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (7)

1. Why does the psalmist use שָׁתוּל (transplanted) rather than נָטַע (planted) for the righteous tree?
2. What is the significance of the threefold progression הָלַךְ → עָמָד → יָשָׁב in moral compromise?
3. How does the verb יֶהְגֶּה (meditate/mutter) relate to ancient study practices?
4. Why is the treatment of the wicked so brief (one verse) compared to the righteous (three verses)?
5. What does YHWH's 'knowing' the way of the righteous imply beyond mere cognition?
6. How does the chiastic structure בְּתוֹרַת יְהֹוָה / וּֽבְתוֹרָתוֹ function theologically?
7. What is the relationship between individual righteousness (vv.1-4) and community identity (v.5)?
