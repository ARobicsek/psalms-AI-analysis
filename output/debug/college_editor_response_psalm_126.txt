### EDITORIAL ASSESSMENT

The existing introduction and commentary are impressively researched and often insightful. They handle the big issues of Psalm 126 well: temporal ambiguity, the shift from praise to petition, and the agricultural imagery. The writer clearly knows the medieval commentators, BDB, and some ANE background, and occasionally lands excellent readings (e.g., the Negev wadis as sudden, not gradual, transformation; the pronoun shift from “them” to “us” in vv.2–3).

For a first‑year college audience, though, several problems get in the way:

- The tone is heavily academic and sometimes reads like an article for a specialist journal: lots of jargon (“prophetic perfect,” “Somatic imagery,” “ontological”), and names of scholars dropped without explanation. Terms like *infinitive absolute*, *Hiphil*, *kethiv/qere*, *synthetic parallelism* are used without being defined in plain language.
- The structure is dense. The main big-picture ideas (what the psalm is about, how it moves, why the images matter) are there, but they’re buried under long paragraphs and footnote-style asides.
- Some wonderful rabbinic and liturgical material from the research bundle is underused or missing:  
  – The Talmud’s “Honi the Circle Maker” story (Ta’anit 23a) as a creative reading of “we were like dreamers.”  
  – Berakhot 31a’s ruling about not “filling one’s mouth with laughter” until the redemption, based on v.2.  
  – Ta’anit 8b comparing a day of rain to the ingathering of exiles, based on v.4.  
- The liturgical section, though solid, is not structured for easy reading: it could be clearer which traditions do what, and it rarely quotes the prayers themselves in Hebrew.
- The verse-by-verse commentary is rich but assumes too much grammatical background and rarely pauses to explain *why* a device (like the infinitive absolute in v.6) actually matters for reading the poem.

The revision should keep the scholarly depth but repackage it: clear headings, short paragraphs, lots of concrete examples (with Hebrew + English), definitions of every technical term on first use, and explicit “why this is cool” explanations. The tone should feel like a smart, relaxed classroom, not an exam in disguise.

### REVISED INTRODUCTION

#### A psalm you probably already sing

If you’ve ever “bentched” (said *Birkat HaMazon*, Grace After Meals) on Shabbat or Yom Tov, you almost certainly know the opening of Psalm 126 by heart:

> שִׁיר הַמַּעֲלוֹת; בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה אֶת־שִׁיבַת צִיּוֹן; הָיִינוּ כְּחֹלְמִים.  
> *Shir ha‑ma‘alot; b’shuv Adonai et‑shivat Tziyon; hayinu k’cholmim.*  
> “A song of ascents. When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like dreamers.”

It’s a tiny psalm—six verses, under fifty words in Hebrew—but it’s doing an impressive amount of work. It remembers a past rescue, begs for more rescue now, and turns that mix of joy and anxiety into a kind of proverb about how God works in the world: “Those who sow in tears will reap with songs of joy.”

So this is a short poem with long arms: it reaches backward to the return from exile in Babylon, it reaches forward to messianic hope, and it reaches right into your Shabbat table.

Let’s map how it does that.

#### A quick map of the psalm

The psalm falls into three movements:

1. **Verses 1–3: Remembered (or imagined) restoration**  
   - God “restored the fortunes of Zion.”  
   - It felt like a dream.  
   - The nations say, “The LORD has done great things for them,” and Israel echoes, “The LORD has done great things for us; we were joyful.”

2. **Verse 4: Sudden pivot to prayer**  
   - “Restore our fortunes, O LORD, like watercourses in the Negev.”  
   - Same root “return/restore” (*שׁוּב*) as v.1, but now as an urgent command.

3. **Verses 5–6: A proverb in picture form**  
   - Those who sow in tears will reap in joy.  
   - A lone farmer walks out to the field weeping, carrying seed; he returns singing, carrying sheaves.

Notice the emotional curve: ecstatic memory → “Wait, we’re not done yet” → calm, stubborn hope. That tension—real joy but incomplete redemption—is exactly why this psalm keeps getting reused.

#### The time-travel trick: “When the LORD restored…”

The very first phrase is already slippery:

> בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה אֶת־שִׁיבַת צִיּוֹן  
> *b’shuv Adonai et‑shivat Tziyon*

The verb *בְּשׁוּב* is an infinitive construct—think “when/while returning”—and in biblical Hebrew it can lean either past (“when he restored”) or future (“when he restores”).

Classical commentators exploit that:

- **Rashi** hears it as *future*: “When God will return the exiles of Zion, we will have been like dreamers.” We’re still in exile; the psalm is imagining the future redemption as already accomplished.
- **Ibn Ezra** insists on *past*: this is about the actual return from Babylon in 538 BCE. They really came back.
- **Radak** splits the difference: there *was* a historical return (vv.1–3), but it was incomplete—that’s why v.4 still cries, “Restore our fortunes!”

For us as readers (and as worshipers), this built‑in ambiguity is a feature, not a bug. It lets every generation stand in all three time zones at once: we remember past rescues, we feel current lack, and we treat future redemption as so sure we can talk about it in the past tense.

Hebrew actually has a name for this trick: the **“prophetic perfect”**—using a past‑tense form to talk about something that hasn’t happened yet, in order to show how certain it is.

#### “We were like dreamers” – psychology or recovery?

The second half of v.1 is equally strange and wonderful:

> הָיִינוּ כְּחֹלְמִים  
> *hayinu k’cholmim* – “we were like dreamers.”

Most readers hear that as “pinch me, I’m dreaming”: the return was so unexpectedly good it felt unreal. That fits other biblical uses of dream imagery, like:

> כַּחֲלוֹם מֵהָקִיץ  
> *kakhalom mehaqitz* – “like a dream upon waking” (Psalm 73:20),  
> where a dream stands for something fleeting and unbelievable.

Some modern scholars, though, suggest that *כְּחֹלְמִים* might come from a related root meaning “to be healthy, strong.” In Job 39:4 we get:

> בְּנֵיהֶם יַחְלְמוּ  
> “Their young ones grow strong.”

If you read our verse that way, it becomes “we were like people restored to health.” Exile is a kind of sickness; coming home is like finally getting your strength back.

Either way, the point is the same: this wasn’t just a small improvement. It felt like an altered state—either like waking from a nightmare into good news, or like getting out of the hospital and breathing real air again.

The Talmud plays with this line in a famous story about **Honi ha‑Me‘aggel** (“Honi the Circle Maker,” Ta’anit 23a). Honi puzzles over our verse: “Is it possible to dream for seventy years?” He then miraculously falls asleep for seventy years and wakes up to find the world changed and himself forgotten. For the sages, “we were like dreamers” isn’t only joy; it’s also the weird dislocation of history. Restoration can feel alien if you’ve been gone too long.

#### From outsiders’ awe to insiders’ affirmation

Verses 2–3 give us a neat little dialogue:

> אָז יֹאמְרוּ בַגּוֹיִם:  
> הִגְדִּיל יְהוָה לַעֲשׂוֹת עִם־אֵלֶּה.  
> *Then they will say among the nations:  
> “The LORD has done great things with these (people).”*  
>   
> הִגְדִּיל יְהוָה לַעֲשׂוֹת עִמָּנוּ; הָיִינוּ שְׂמֵחִים.  
> *“The LORD has done great things with us; we were joyful.”* (vv.2–3)

The line הִגְדִּיל יְהוָה לַעֲשׂוֹת (“the LORD has done great things”) is repeated word‑for‑word. Only the pronoun shifts from “with them” (*עִם־אֵלֶּה*) to “with us” (*עִמָּנוּ*). 

The poet is doing something subtle: Israel first hears its story told from the outside—by the *goyim*, the nations looking on in shock—then turns and repeats the same words in its own voice. It’s like hearing, “Wow, your life turned around,” and then finally being able to say, “Yes—my life turned around.”

That outer witness also echoes prophetic texts like Isaiah 52:10:

> וְרָאוּ כׇּל־אַפְסֵי־אָרֶץ  
> אֵת יְשׁוּעַת אֱלֹהֵינוּ.  
> *“All the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.”*

In other words: this isn’t just a private spiritual experience. It’s God’s PR campaign to the world.

#### The plot twist in the middle: “Restore our fortunes!”

Just when you think the psalm is wrapping up its happy story, v.4 slams on the brakes:

> שׁוּבָה יְהוָה אֶת־שְׁבִיתֵנוּ;  
> כַּאֲפִיקִים בַּנֶּגֶב.  
> *Shuvah Adonai et‑sh’viteinu;  
> ka’afikim ba‑Negev.*  
> “Restore our fortunes, O LORD,  
> like watercourses in the Negev.”

The same root *שׁוּב* (“turn back, return”) that opened the psalm is back, but now as a shouted imperative: *Restore!*. That instantly re‑frames vv.1–3. Yes, something wonderful happened—but it wasn’t the end of the story. There is still poverty, still danger, still spiritual dryness.

The phrase *אֶת־שְׁבִיתֵנוּ* (“our captivity” or “our fortunes”) hides a little textual knot. In several places the Bible uses an idiom *שׁוּב שְׁבוּת* (“turn back the captivity” = “restore the fortunes”), as in:

> וְשָׁב יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ אֶת־שְׁבוּתְךָ  
> *“The LORD your God will restore your fortunes”* (Deut 30:3).

Our psalm alludes to that formula, so we should hear both nuances: “change our situation” and “bring the exiles home.”

Then comes one of the psalm’s most vivid pictures.

#### Flash floods in the desert: “like watercourses in the Negev”

The **Negev** is Israel’s southern desert. Its *אֲפִיקִים* (*afikim*) are dry streambeds—wadis—that lie empty most of the year. But when heavy rains fall in the hills, they can suddenly turn into roaring torrents.

So v.4 doesn’t pray, “Water us slowly over time.” It asks for a **flash flood of grace**: a sudden, unmistakable transformation where what has been cracked and lifeless is overnight full of rushing water.

The Talmud picks up this image in a lovely comparison: 

> “Great is the day of rain like the day of the ingathering of exiles, as it is said,  
> ‘Restore our fortunes, O LORD, like watercourses in the Negev’” (Ta’anit 8b).

Rain isn’t just a nice metaphor *for* redemption; in rabbinic imagination, a good rainstorm *is* a little rehearsal of redemption.

#### Sowing in tears, reaping in joy

The last two verses zoom out from Israel’s specific story to a more general pattern:

> הַזֹּרְעִים בְּדִמְעָה; בְּרִנָּה יִקְצֹרוּ.  
> *Ha‑zor‘im b’dim‘ah; b’rinah yiktzoru.*  
> “Those who sow in tears will reap with songs of joy.” (v.5)  
>   
> הָלוֹךְ יֵלֵךְ וּבָכֹה; נֹשֵׂא מֶשֶׁךְ־הַזָּרַע;  
> בֹּא יָבֹא בְרִנָּה; נֹשֵׂא אֲלֻמֹּתָיו.  
> *Halokh yelekh u‑vakho, nosei meshekh‑ha‑zara‘;  
> bo yavo b’rinah, nosei alumotav.*  
> “He goes along weeping,  
> carrying the measure of seed;  
> he will surely come back with songs of joy,  
> carrying his sheaves.” (v.6)

In a subsistence farming world, sowing is an anxious act. The seed you scatter into the ground is the food you *could* have eaten now. If the rains fail, you’ve buried your children’s dinner.

So the “tears” here are not poetic emo; they’re real fear. The phrase *מֶשֶׁךְ־הַזָּרַע* (*meshekh ha‑zara‘*) probably means the precious “measure” or carefully drawn “trail” of seed—BDB glosses *meshekh* as “a drawing, trail.” Either way, the point is: this is all you’ve got, and you’re risking it.

The payoff image is beautiful: the same person who went out weeping with a tiny bag now stomps home laughing under the weight of *אֲלֻמֹּתָיו* (*alumotav*), his sheaves. (Same rare noun as Joseph’s dream in Gen 37:7.)

And the grammar quietly underlines the certainty: those doubled verbs *הָלוֹךְ יֵלֵךְ* and *בֹּא יָבֹא* (an **infinitive absolute** plus a finite verb) are a Hebrew way of saying “surely, absolutely he will go/come.”

This is more than “hang in there, it’ll get better.” The psalm is saying: in God’s economy, **risking yourself in faith**—sowing into a dry season, obeying in exile, doing mitzvot when it feels pointless—belongs to a built‑in pattern. Tears are not the end of the story; they are what water the future harvest.

The medieval commentators happily spiritualize this. Radak says the “sowing” is the performance of commandments in exile; the “reaping” is the future reward. But the proverb only works because it’s rooted in very concrete, dirt‑under‑your‑fingernails experience.

#### Why this psalm keeps getting used

Put it all together, and you can see why Psalm 126 is recited before Grace After Meals on Shabbat and festivals, and why it’s beloved in both Jewish and Christian tradition:

- It’s honest: we *have* seen God do great things; we also still lack a lot.
- It’s flexible in time: you can pray it in Babylon, in Second Temple Jerusalem, in medieval Ashkenaz, in modern Israel, or at your dorm Shabbat dinner.
- It gives you two unforgettable pictures for hope:  
  – Flash floods in a desert wadi.  
  – A weeping farmer coming home with armfuls of grain.

And it quietly invites you to live as someone who’s willing to sow in tears because you trust that the God who once made you “like dreamers” is not done yet.

  
---LITURGICAL-SECTION-START---

#### Full psalm

In most Ashkenazi and Sephardi rites, Psalm 126—known simply as *Shir HaMa‘alot*—is sung **in full** as the prelude to *Birkat HaMazon* (Grace After Meals) on Shabbat, festivals, and joyous occasions. Right before the formal invitation to bless (*זימון*), everyone joins in:

> שִׁיר הַמַּעֲלוֹת, בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה אֶת־שִׁיבַת צִיּוֹן הָיִינוּ כְּחֹלְמִים.  
> אָז יִמָּלֵא שְׂחוֹק פִּינוּ, וּלְשׁוֹנֵנוּ רִנָּה…

On weekdays, many communities instead say the mournful Psalm 137 (“By the rivers of Babylon”), so choosing Psalm 126 for Shabbat/Yom Tov turns the meal into a mini‑rehearsal of redemption.

In some Sephardi/Edot HaMizrach customs, the full psalm is also recited:

- As part of the fifteen *Shir HaMa‘alot* psalms after Shabbat *Minchah* in the winter.
- In **Tikkun Leah**, the more hopeful half of the *Tikkun Chatzot* midnight service, where it voices trust in future restoration.
- Before **Birkat Ha‘Ilanot** (Blessing of the Trees) in Nisan, linking the springtime blossoming of fruit trees with the psalm’s imagery of sowing and reaping.

#### Phrases

Several individual phrases from Psalm 126 have been woven into other prayers.

1. **וּלְשׁוֹנֵנוּ רִנָּה – “and our tongue [filled] with joyous song” (v.2)**  
   In *Nishmat Kol Chai*, the grand Shabbat/festival prayer, this becomes part of a cosmic “we can’t possibly praise You enough” passage:

   > וְאִלּוּ פִינוּ מָלֵא שִׁירָה כַּיָּם,  
   > וּלְשׁוֹנֵנוּ רִנָּה כַּהֲמוֹן גַּלָּיו…  
   > *“Even if our mouths were as full of song as the sea,  
   > and our tongues with joyous song like its mighty waves…”*

   Our psalm’s image of over‑flowing praise gets expanded to oceanic proportions.

2. **אָז יִמָּלֵא שְׂחוֹק פִּינוּ – “then our mouth will be filled with laughter” (v.2)**  
   The Talmud (Berakhot 31a) quotes this to say:  

   > “It is forbidden for a person to fill his mouth with laughter in this world, as it is said, ‘*Then* our mouth will be filled with laughter…’”  

   Some Sephardi machzorim (High Holiday prayerbooks) echo this in the *Vidui HaGadol* (Great Confession) on Yom Kippur, turning the verse into a self‑critique:

   > מִלֵּאנוּ שְׂחוֹק פִּינוּ בָּעוֹלָם הַזֶּה…  
   > *“We filled our mouths with laughter in this world…”*

   What in the psalm is promised joy becomes, in a penitential context, “maybe we laughed too easily, before the world was really healed.”

3. **הִגְדִּיל יְהוָה לַעֲשׂוֹת עִם־אֵלֶּה – “the LORD has done great things with these” (v.2)**  
   In some Edot HaMizrach customs, this line appears in a *Yehi Ratzon* (“May it be Your will”) recited in Nisan after the reading about the tribal princes’ offerings. The prayer imagines the future redemption and concludes:

   > אָז יֹאמְרוּ בַגּוֹיִם: הִגְדִּיל יְהוָה לַעֲשׂוֹת עִם־אֵלֶּה.  
   > *“Then the nations will say: ‘The LORD has done great things with these.’”*

   It turns the psalm’s remembered past into a wished‑for future.

4. **הַזֹּרְעִים בְּדִמְעָה בְּרִנָּה יִקְצֹרוּ – “those who sow in tears will reap with song” (v.5)**  
   These lines surface in mystical/lament liturgies like *Tikkun Chatzot* and in the blessings over blossoming trees, where they link agricultural renewal with the hope that present exile‑tears will someday turn into harvest‑joy.

### REVISED VERSE COMMENTARY

#### Verse 1

שִׁיר הַמַּעֲלוֹת; בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה אֶת־שִׁיבַת צִיּוֹן; הָיִינוּ כְּחֹלְמִים.

The heading *שִׁיר הַמַּעֲלוֹת* (*shir ha‑ma‘alot*, “a song of ascents”) marks this psalm as part of Psalms 120–134, probably used by pilgrims “going up” (*ma‘alot* = steps/ascents) to Jerusalem. You can picture groups of travelers singing this together as they climb.

The real action starts with:

> בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה אֶת־שִׁיבַת צִיּוֹן  
> *b’shuv Adonai et‑shivat Tziyon* – “When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion…”

The verb *בְּשׁוּב* comes from *שׁוּב* (“to turn back, return”). In this form (“infinitive construct”), it usually means “when” or “whenever” God returns/restores. Hebrew leaves the time reference open: is this “when he **restored**” (past) or “when he **restores**” (future)? That ambiguity is why Rashi can read it as future redemption, while Ibn Ezra hears it as a memory of the return from Babylon.

The noun *שִׁיבַת* is related either to *שׁוּב* (“return”) or to *שְׁבוּת* (“captivity/fortunes”). Other verses use the idiom *שׁוּב שְׁבוּת* for “restore the fortunes,” like:

> וְשָׁב יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ אֶת־שְׁבוּתְךָ  
> *“The LORD your God will restore your fortunes”* (Deut 30:3).

So *שִׁיבַת צִיּוֹן* can carry both “the return of Zion” and “Zion’s changed fortunes.” It’s physical and economic/spiritual at once.

Then comes the killer simile:

> הָיִינוּ כְּחֹלְמִים  
> *hayinu k’cholmim* – “we were like dreamers.”

On the standard reading, *חֹלְמִים* comes from *חָלַם* (“to dream”). The rescue was so astonishing it felt unreal—“too good to be true.” Psalm 73:20 uses a similar image:

> כַּחֲלוֹם מֵהָקִיץ  
> *kakhalom mehaqitz* – “like a dream upon waking,”  
> for how God will treat the wicked: their success will vanish like a morning dream.

Some lexicographers, noticing related words in Aramaic and Job 39:4 (בְּנֵיהֶם יַחְלְמוּ – “their young grow strong”), suggest an alternate root meaning “to be strong/healthy.” Then our line would mean “we were like those restored to health.” Exile makes the body politic sick; coming home is like recovery.

Either way, the point is radical discontinuity. You don’t drift into this state; you wake up into it. The line is short, but the psychological effect is huge: the community’s whole sense of reality has to recalibrate.

The rabbis amplify this in the story of **Honi ha‑Me‘aggel** (Ta’anit 23a). Honi hears “we were like dreamers” and wonders, “How can you dream for seventy years?” God obligingly puts him to sleep for seventy years; he wakes into a world that has moved on without him. The “dream” of exile and return is both miracle and rupture.

Liturgically, saying this line before *Birkat HaMazon* invites you to see your ordinary meal through that lens: “I’m sitting here, full and safe, because somewhere in our history God did something so unexpected we could hardly believe it.”

#### Verse 2

אָז יִמָּלֵא שְׂחוֹק פִּינוּ; וּלְשׁוֹנֵנוּ רִנָּה; אָז יֹאמְרוּ בַגּוֹיִם: הִגְדִּיל יְהוָה לַעֲשׂוֹת עִם־אֵלֶּה.

Verse 2 opens with a double *אָז* (*az*, “then”), a little example of **anaphora**—repeating a word at the start of successive phrases for emphasis:

> אָז יִמָּלֵא… אָז יֹאמְרוּ…  
> “*Then* our mouth will be filled… *then* they will say…”

It pushes you to hear a cause‑and‑effect chain: when God restores Zion, *then* inner joy erupts, and *then* the world notices.

The first half is wonderfully physical:

> יִמָּלֵא שְׂחוֹק פִּינוּ  
> *yimmale s’chok pinu* – “our mouth will be filled with laughter”  
>   
> וּלְשׁוֹנֵנוּ רִנָּה  
> *ul’shonenu rinah* – “and our tongue [with] songs of joy.”

The verb *יִמָּלֵא* (“be filled”) makes laughter and song into substances that can literally stuff your mouth. The two nouns tilt from involuntary joy (*שְׂחוֹק*, laughter) to more articulated celebration (*רִנָּה*, ringing song).

This phrase shows up exactly in *Nishmat Kol Chai*:  

> וְאִלּוּ פִינוּ מָלֵא שִׁירָה כַּיָּם,  
> וּלְשׁוֹנֵנוּ רִנָּה כַּהֲמוֹן גַּלָּיו…  
> *“Were our mouths as full of song as the sea, and our tongues with joyous song as the roar of its waves…”*  

By quoting Psalm 126, that prayer says: the kind of joy our psalm imagines at redemption is the scale of joy we *wish* we could offer God every Shabbat.

The Talmud, interestingly, reads this line in a different emotional key. Berakhot 31a says:

> “It is forbidden for a person to fill his mouth with laughter in this world, as it is said, ‘*Then* our mouth will be filled with laughter…’”

If “then” is the messianic future, now is not quite the time for full‑throttle laughter. That’s a pretty intense way of saying: don’t get too comfortable in a broken world.

The second colon moves from Israel’s insides to the outside world:

> אָז יֹאמְרוּ בַגּוֹיִם:  
> הִגְדִּיל יְהוָה לַעֲשׂוֹת עִם־אֵלֶּה.  
> *“Then they will say among the nations:  
> ‘The LORD has done great things with these [people].’”*

The verb *הִגְדִּיל… לַעֲשׂוֹת* literally “has made great to act” is a Hebrew way of saying “has done something really big.” The nations are bystanders, but they understand what they’re seeing: a people whose situation has flipped so drastically that only divine intervention makes sense.

Prophets love this motif, e.g. Isaiah 52:10:

> וְרָאוּ כׇּל־אַפְסֵי־אָרֶץ  
> אֵת יְשׁוּעַת אֱלֹהֵינוּ.  
> *“All the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.”*

So v.2 holds two perspectives at once: the community’s overflowing inner joy and the world’s stunned acknowledgment. The “great things” God does are public.

#### Verse 3

הִגְדִּיל יְהוָה לַעֲשׂוֹת עִמָּנוּ; הָיִינוּ שְׂמֵחִים.

Verse 3 is brief but rhetorically sharp. It simply repeats the nations’ statement from v.2, with one crucial tweak:

> הִגְדִּיל יְהוָה לַעֲשׂוֹת עִמָּנוּ  
> *higdil Adonai la‘asot imanu* – “The LORD has done great things **with us**.”

Where the nations said *עִם־אֵלֶּה* (“with these [people]”), Israel now says *עִמָּנוּ* (“with us”). It’s like the community is overhearing its reputation and then claiming that description as its own.

This pronoun swap does something theologically important. It moves the restoration story from being an object of other people’s fascination (“Look what happened to them!”) to being Israel’s own internal confession of God’s goodness (“Look what God did *for us*”).

The second colon is almost minimalist:

> הָיִינוּ שְׂמֵחִים  
> *hayinu s’mechim* – “we were joyful.”

That *הָיִינוּ* (“we were”) matches v.1’s *הָיִינוּ כְּחֹלְמִים* (“we were like dreamers”), forming a small inclusio: the dream‑state of v.1 and the joy of v.3 are two ways of describing the same overwhelming experience.

Grammatically, both *הִגְדִּיל* and *הָיִינוּ* are past‑tense (“perfect”) forms. But as we noted in the introduction, biblical Hebrew can use past tense to describe a future, certain event—the so‑called “prophetic perfect.” That may be what some medievals have in mind: Israel is rehearsing the future redemption as if it had already happened.

Malbim, a 19th‑century commentator obsessed (in a good way) with nuance, suggests an extra layer: the nations see only the *political* miracle (“tiny people comes home!”); Israel also senses the *covenantal* dimension (“God kept His ancient promises to us”). Same words, but different depth of understanding depending on who’s speaking.

This verse also acts as a hinge. Verses 1–3 have been all “God did, we were”; in v.4, the mood jumps abruptly to “God, **do**.” Feeling that jump between v.3 and v.4 is key to feeling the psalm.

#### Verse 4

שׁוּבָה יְהוָה אֶת־שְׁבִיתֵנוּ; כַּאֲפִיקִים בַּנֶּגֶב.

Here the psalm pivots from narration to plea:

> שׁוּבָה יְהוָה אֶת־שְׁבִיתֵנוּ  
> *shuvah Adonai et‑sh’viteinu* – “Restore our fortunes, O LORD.”

*שׁוּבָה* is an imperative form of *שׁוּב* (“return, turn back”), with an extra *‑ה* that often adds urgency. It’s closer to “O LORD, **please** restore!” than to a calm request. After three verses of “God has done great things,” this cry of “Do it again!” is jarring—and that’s the point. It reveals that the earlier joy was either incomplete in history or being spoken in advance.

The noun *שְׁבִיתֵנוּ* is related to *שְׁבוּת* (“captivity / fortunes”), the same root as the idiom *שׁוּב שְׁבוּת* we saw earlier. Some manuscripts write it slightly differently (*שְׁבוּתֵנוּ*), but either way, the sense is “our state of exile/misfortune.” This is not just about geography; it’s about the whole condition of the people.

The imagery kicks in with the simile:

> כַּאֲפִיקִים בַּנֶּגֶב  
> *ka’afikim ba‑Negev* – “like watercourses in the Negev.”

*אֲפִיקִים* (*afikim*) are channel‑beds, usually dry. The Negev is Israel’s southern desert. For most of the year, its wadis are sun‑baked trenches. But when heavy rains fall up north or in the highlands, flash floods roar through these channels, transforming the landscape in a matter of hours.

So “restore us like watercourses in the Negev” is not “nudge us gradually in the right direction.” It’s “surprise us with a sudden, life‑saving flood in a place that has forgotten what water feels like.”

The Talmud (Ta’anit 8b) draws a memorable comparison from this:  

> “Great is the day of rain like the day of the ingathering of exiles, as it is said,  
> ‘Restore our fortunes, O LORD, like watercourses in the Negev.’”

Rain that finally hits parched land and exiles finally coming home are, in rabbinic imagination, parallel miracles. The simile in our verse becomes a kind of equation: **rain = redemption.**

On a poetic level, this line also mirrors v.1:  

- v.1: *בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה אֶת־שִׁיבַת צִיּוֹן* – “When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion…”  
- v.4: *שׁוּבָה יְהוָה אֶת־שְׁבִיתֵנוּ* – “Restore our fortunes, O LORD…”

Same verb, same pattern, but now turned into a direct address. The psalmist is basically saying: “You’ve got a track record. Do that again.”

#### Verse 5

הַזֹּרְעִים בְּדִמְעָה; בְּרִנָּה יִקְצֹרוּ.

Verse 5 shifts gears into proverb mode:

> הַזֹּרְעִים בְּדִמְעָה  
> *ha‑zor‘im b’dim‘ah* – “Those who sow in tears”  
>   
> בְּרִנָּה יִקְצֹרוּ  
> *b’rinah yiktzoru* – “will reap with songs of joy.”

The form *הַזֹּרְעִים* is a participle (“those who are sowing”), and it’s plural and general. We’re not just talking about one historical group now; this is a pattern: *anyone* who is sowing “in tears” fits.

To feel the force of this you need to picture the farmer’s world. In a good year, planting is hopeful. In a marginal, drought‑prone land like ancient Judah—especially in the lean early Second Temple period (see Haggai 1:6: “You have sown much, but bring in little”)—sowing is terrifying. The seed you scatter is edible grain; it’s literally the line between your family and starvation. If the rains fail, your gamble kills you.

So “in tears” (*בְּדִמְעָה*) is not metaphorical angst. It’s a farmer walking out to the field with a knot in his stomach.

The payoff phrase *בְּרִנָּה יִקְצֹרוּ* flips the sound and sense. *רִנָּה* (*rinah*) means a ringing cry, often of joy; the verb *יִקְצֹרוּ* (“they will reap”) comes from harvest. The image is simple but strong: wets hands, dry eyes; dry hands, wet eyes—then the reverse.

This “sow/weep, reap/rejoice” structure echoes other biblical uses of agriculture as moral/spiritual metaphor. Hosea 10:12, for example, says:

> זִרְעוּ לָכֶם לִצְדָקָה; קִצְרוּ לְפִי־חֶסֶד  
> *“Sow for yourselves in righteousness; reap according to kindness.”*

There, “seed” is righteous actions and “harvest” is God’s generous response. Our psalm stays closer to literal farming but invites the same kind of extension: how might my present costly obedience be “sowing in tears” for a future I can’t yet see?

Radak explicitly makes that move: the “sowing” here is the performance of mitzvot under the burden of exile; the “reaping” is the good reward at redemption. The proverb works precisely because it runs on such a concrete, easily grasped image.

Structurally, verse 5 also prepares you for the very detailed little story in v.6: first the general rule (“those who sow in tears…”), then a close‑up on one such sower.

#### Verse 6

הָלוֹךְ יֵלֵךְ וּבָכֹה; נֹשֵׂא מֶשֶׁךְ־הַזָּרַע; בֹּא יָבֹא בְּרִנָּה; נֹשֵׂא אֲלֻמֹּתָיו.

The last verse turns the proverb into a mini‑movie about a single farmer.

First half:

> הָלוֹךְ יֵלֵךְ וּבָכֹה  
> *halokh yelekh u‑vakho* – “Going, he goes and weeping”  
>   
> נֹשֵׂא מֶשֶׁךְ־הַזָּרַע  
> *nosei meshekh‑ha‑zara‘* – “carrying the measure (or trail) of seed.”

The phrase *הָלוֹךְ יֵלֵךְ* is an example of **infinitive absolute + verb**—a standard Hebrew way to add emphasis or a sense of ongoing action. Literally “going, he will go” = “he surely goes, he keeps going.” Pair that with *וּבָכֹה* (“and weeping”), and you get the feeling of a long, heavy trudge.

*מֶשֶׁךְ־הַזָּרַע* is a rare expression. The noun *מֶשֶׁךְ* comes from a root meaning “to draw, pull.” BDB offers two main options:

- a “drawing/trail” of seed—what’s being scattered behind him; or  
- by extension, the container, the “seed‑bag” he’s carrying.

Either way, the picture is of someone holding something limited and precious. Malbim imagines it as the exact measured amount needed to sow the field: there’s no extra. No wonder he’s crying.

Second half:

> בֹּא יָבֹא בְּרִנָּה  
> *bo yavo b’rinah* – “Coming, he will surely come with song”  
>   
> נֹשֵׂא אֲלֻמֹּתָיו  
> *nosei alumotav* – “carrying his sheaves.”

We get the same intensified verb pattern (*בֹּא יָבֹא*) now paired with *בְּרִנָּה* (“with ringing joy”), and a contrast in what he’s carrying: no longer a little bag/trail of seed but *אֲלֻמֹּתָיו*, his bundles of harvested grain.

The word *אֲלֻמָּה* (“sheaf”) is rare; the most famous occurrence is Joseph’s dream:

> וְהִנֵּה קָמָה אֲלֻמָּתִי…  
> *“And behold, my sheaf arose…”* (Gen 37:7),

where sheaves symbolize status and success. Here, too, the tiny seeds have multiplied into sizable evidence that the risk was worth it.

You can even sketch a little **chiasm** (a mirror‑structure, A‑B‑C‑C'‑B'‑A'):

- A: *going he goes*  
  - B: *weeping*  
    - C: *carrying seed*  
    - C′: *carrying sheaves*  
  - B′: *with joy*  
- A′: *coming he comes*

The “carrying” (*נֹשֵׂא*) is the pivot: same verb, different object. What changes between the outward and return trips is not the effort but what it yields.

Traditional commentators love to apply this beyond agriculture. Rashi says Israel “sows charity in tears” in exile and will reap reward in the future. The Talmud (Ta’anit 5a) playfully illustrates “going and weeping” with an ox who cries on the way out to plow (hard work!) but munches happily on the way back, eating sprouting grain in the furrows—“then he will come with song.”

For the psalm as a whole, this verse is the landing place. After the dizzy joy and the gut‑punch plea, we’re left with a sober but hopeful pattern: **There is a kind of weeping that is not wasted.** When you keep walking, still doing what faith requires (sowing), even through tears, this psalm says you are already part of a story whose final scene is arms full of sheaves and a song you can’t help but sing.
