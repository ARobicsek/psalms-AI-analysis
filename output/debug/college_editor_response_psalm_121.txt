### EDITORIAL ASSESSMENT

The existing introduction and commentary are learned, accurate, and often insightful. They do a good job situating Psalm 121 among the Songs of Ascents, noticing the “from I to you” voice shift, the sixfold שׁמר (shamar), and the cosmic scope of “עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ.” They also connect the psalm to Ancient Near Eastern ideas about sleeping gods and astral deities, and they bring in strong traditional voices (Radak, Meiri, Metzudat David).

For a first‑year college audience, though, there are some problems:

- The tone is quite dense and academic. Technical terms (merism, hendiadys, anadiplosis, etc.) are used without always being clearly defined in plain English. A bright first‑year can handle the ideas, but the jargon needs translating.
- The structure is not very reader‑friendly. Long paragraphs and few signposts make it harder to see the overall argument: how the poem moves from anxiety to assurance.
- Some excellent material from the research bundle is only partly used. For example:
  - The “chain” of עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ in Psalms 121, 124, and 134.
  - The very rich liturgical afterlife (Kaddish, bedtime Shema, Tefillat HaDerech, Pidyon HaBen, Shabbat table) could be illustrated with Hebrew quotations to make the psalm feel “alive” in Jewish practice.
  - Torah Temimah’s midrashic use of ה׳ שֹׁמְרֶךָ, and the way rabbinic literature plays with God as “outside guard,” are barely touched.
- A few analyst questions are raised but not really answered (e.g., the relationship with Psalms 124 and 134, the implications of צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ in v. 8).
- The verse commentary, while strong, sometimes buries the main idea under too many side notes and citations.

Revisions needed: simplify the language without dumbing down the content; define all technical terms in place; break the introduction into clear subsections with headings; integrate liturgical uses with Hebrew quotations; use more concrete analogies; and make very explicit why each poetic move (mountains, feet, shade, sun/moon, going/coming) is interesting and what it contributes to the psalm’s emotional journey.

## REVISED INTRODUCTION

### A quick map of Psalm 121

Here is the whole psalm in one sentence:

A traveler heading toward Jerusalem looks up at the mountains and wonders, “Where will my help come from?” and the answer that comes back—whether from a priest, a friend, or his own better self—is: “Your help comes from YHWH, the God who made everything, and that God is guarding you in every possible way, at every moment.”

Formally, Psalm 121 is one of the שִׁירֵי הַמַּעֲלוֹת, *Shir ha‑ma‘alot*—“Songs of Ascents” (Psalms 120–134). “Ma‘alot” comes from עָלָה, “to go up”: it can mean “steps” or “ascents.” These psalms were probably connected with going up to Jerusalem for the festivals, or with the steps of the Temple, or both. Either way, this is travel poetry. Think “road‑trip psalm,” but the “road trip” is on foot, past cliffs and bandits.

The psalm has a very tight structure:

- **Verses 1–2**: “I” speak—question and answer: *where* will help come from? *From YHWH, maker of heaven and earth.*
- **Verses 3–8**: Someone speaks to “you”—a long reassurance that YHWH is guarding you constantly.

That shift from **“I”** to **“you”** is the main structural trick of the poem, and it’s where most of the interesting interpretation happens.

### Looking up at the mountains (v. 1–2)

The psalm opens:

> אֶשָּׂא עֵינַי אֶל־הֶהָרִים; מֵאַיִן יָבֹא עֶזְרִי׃  
> “I lift my eyes to the mountains; from where will my help come?”

The Hebrew מֵאַיִן (*me’ayin*) is a strong “whence?”—not “I’m pretty sure help is coming; from which direction?” but “Is there *any* help at all?” BDB (the standard Brown–Driver–Briggs dictionary) notes this form especially in more elevated, poetic style.

But what about “the mountains” (הֶהָרִים)? Are they good or bad?

- On the one hand, mountains are dangerous terrain for an ancient traveler: steep paths, sudden falls, bandits, wild animals.
- On the other hand, in the Ancient Near East, mountains are the classic place where gods live. Baal’s home is Mount Ṣapōn; the Mesopotamian gods meet on a cosmic mountain. Even in Israel, “high places” on hills were used for forbidden cults (Deut 12:2).

So when the pilgrim looks up, we can hear at least two questions at once:

1. “Will the mountains hurt me?” (physically, politically, spiritually)
2. “Should I be looking to *those* high places for help—those other gods, those other shrines?”

The answer in verse 2 is as short and sharp as you can get:

> עֶזְרִי מֵעִם יְהוָה; עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ׃  
> “My help comes from YHWH, maker of heaven and earth.”

“My help” (עֶזְרִי) is fronted for emphasis. The preposition מֵעִם (*me‘im*) literally means “from with”—help comes “from being with YHWH,” not from geography.

Then we get the big title: **עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ** (*‘oseh shamayim va’aretz*), “maker of heaven and earth.” This is a **merism**: a figure of speech where you mention two extremes (“heaven” and “earth”) to mean “the whole thing.” Like saying “day and night” to mean “all the time.”

This exact phrase shows up at key places:

- Psalm 124:8:  
  > עֶזְרֵנוּ בְּשֵׁם יְהוָה; עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ׃  
  > “Our help is in the name of YHWH, maker of heaven and earth.”
- Psalm 134:3 (the last Song of Ascents):  
  > יְבָרֶכְךָ יְהוָה מִצִּיּוֹן; עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ׃  
  > “May YHWH bless you from Zion, maker of heaven and earth.”

In Psalm 121 it’s “**my** help”; in Psalm 124, “**our** help”; in Psalm 134, a blessing: “May YHWH bless **you**…” The same formula links personal trust, communal deliverance, and Temple blessing.

The polemical edge is pretty clear: your help does *not* come from some local mountain god. It comes from the One who made those mountains—and everything else.

### A dialogue on the road: who is talking to whom?

Verses 3–8 switch from “I” to “you”:

> אַל־יִתֵּן לַמּוֹט רַגְלֶךָ; אַל־יָנוּם שֹׁמְרֶךָ׃  
> “He will not let your foot slip; your guardian will not slumber.”

That’s abrupt. Most medieval Jewish commentators heard a change of speaker here. Metzudat David (an 18th‑century “explain‑it‑clearly” commentator) puts it like this: “כאלו אחד יאמר לחבירו דרך נחמה” – “It is as if one person says to his friend, as comfort…”

In other words, the anxious “I” of verses 1–2 gets answered by a second voice—maybe a priest at the Temple, maybe another pilgrim, maybe the psalmist talking to his own soul. But liturgically it’s very easy to picture this as a dialogue: individual question, communal or priestly reassurance.

### The key verb: שׁמר — not just “to keep an eye on”

From verse 3 onward one Hebrew root keeps thudding like a drum: **שׁמר** (*shamar*), “to keep, guard, watch.” It appears six times:

- שֹׁמְרֶךָ “your guardian” (v. 3, v. 5)
- שׁוֹמֵר יִשְׂרָאֵל “guardian of Israel” (v. 4)
- יִשְׁמׇרְךָ “will guard you” (v. 7)
- יִשְׁמֹר אֶת־נַפְשֶׁךָ “will guard your life” (v. 7)
- יִשְׁמׇר־צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ “will guard your going out and your coming in” (v. 8)

In biblical Hebrew, *shamar* is an active, covenant word. Humans “keep” God’s commandments (שְׁמוֹר וְעֲשֵׂה), priests “keep” guard over the sanctuary, Adam is put in the garden לְעָבְדָהּ וּלְשָׁמְרָהּ, “to work it and guard it.” Guarding is not passive surveillance; it is committed care.

Here that covenant verb is applied to God: God is the one doing the guarding. If you’ve ever said the Friday night Kiddush—“זֵכֶר לִיצִיאַת מִצְרָיִם… שָׁמַר וְזָכַר בְּדִבּוּר אֶחָד”—you know *shamar* as God’s instruction to Israel (“keep Shabbat”). Psalm 121 flips it: YHWH is the one “keeping” *you*.

The sixfold repetition is almost incantatory. It doesn’t just say “you’re guarded”; it performs that guarding in the rhythm of the poem.

### Images of risk: feet, shade, sun, moon

The reassuring voice moves through a series of very concrete images.

First, your **foot** on a mountain path:

> אַל־יִתֵּן לַמּוֹט רַגְלֶךָ׃  
> “He will not let your foot slip.”

The verb מוֹט (*mot*) means “to totter, to shake.” Psalm 15 ends with “עֹשֵׂה־אֵלֶּה לֹא יִמּוֹט לְעוֹלָם׃” – “One who does these things shall never be shaken” (Ps 15:5). Psalm 125:1 says, “הַבֹּטְחִים בַּיהוָה כְּהַר־צִיּוֹן לֹא יִמּוֹט” – “Those who trust in YHWH are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved.” Here, instead of a mountain that doesn’t move, it’s your foot that doesn’t slide *off* the mountain.

Then we get the central pair of verses (5–6):

> יְהוָה שֹׁמְרֶךָ; יְהוָה צִלְּךָ עַל־יַד יְמִינֶךָ׃  
> יוֹמָם הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ לֹא יַכֶּכָּה; וְיָרֵחַ בַּלָּיְלָה׃  
> “YHWH is your guardian; YHWH is your shade at your right hand.  
> By day the sun shall not strike you, nor the moon by night.”

The “shade” image is wonderfully double:

- Literally, in that climate, shade keeps you from sunstroke. Sun beating on your head all day is not poetic imagery; it’s how you die on the road (cf. Jonah 4).
- Metaphorically, shade is any protective cover. Psalm 91:1 says:  
  > “יֹשֵׁב בְּסֵתֶר עֶלְיוֹן; בְּצֵל שַׁדַּי יִתְלוֹנָן׃”  
  > “One who dwells in the shelter of the Most High, in the shadow of Shaddai will lodge.”

“On your right hand” (עַל־יַד יְמִינֶךָ) probably alludes to fighting. For a right‑handed soldier the right side is where the weapon is, and also the exposed flank. Ibn Ezra reads this as God taking up position as your shield on that vulnerable side.

Verse 6 then unpacks the shade image as protection from **sun and moon** across **day and night**. That’s another merism: “day/night” = all time. Beyond the literal medical danger (Radak, thinking in medieval humoral terms, talks about the sun drying up moisture and the moon adding too much), there’s a quiet polemic here. Deuteronomy 4:19 warns Israel not to worship “the sun and the moon and the stars.” Psalm 121 portrays them not as gods but as created lights whose harmful effects are themselves under YHWH’s control.

### “The Guardian of Israel” and the individual

In verse 4 the focus briefly zooms out:

> הִנֵּה לֹא־יָנוּם וְלֹא יִישָׁן; שׁוֹמֵר יִשְׂרָאֵל׃  
> “See, the Guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps!”

The double verb—*slumber* (נוּם) and *sleep* (יָשֵׁן)—piles on emphasis. Meiri notes the nuance: “התנומה היא שֵׁינָה קַלָּה וְהַשֵּׁינָה שֵׁינָה גְּמוּרָה” – “slumber is light sleep, and sleep is deep sleep.” The line is also almost certainly a jab at religions where gods can, in fact, be asleep or absent. Elijah famously mocks the prophets of Baal: “קִרְאוּ בְקוֹל גָּדוֹל… אוּלַי יִישַׁן הוּא וְיִקָּץ” – “Shout louder… maybe he is asleep and must be woken up” (1 Kings 18:27).

What’s important here is the shift from “your guardian” (שֹׁמְרֶךָ) to “guardian of Israel” (שׁוֹמֵר יִשְׂרָאֵל). The promise to the individual pilgrim is grounded in God’s ongoing guardianship of the whole people. Later, Psalm 131 ends:

> יַחֵל יִשְׂרָאֵל אֶל־יְהוָה; מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם׃  
> “Let Israel hope in YHWH, from now and forever” (Ps 131:3).

Psalm 121:8 will use exactly that phrase, “מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם,” but for God’s guarding. Trust and guarding match.

### The finale: everywhere, always (vv. 7–8)

The psalm finishes by pushing the promise of protection out in every direction:

> יְהוָה יִשְׁמׇרְךָ מִכָּל־רָע; יִשְׁמֹר אֶת־נַפְשֶׁךָ׃  
> יְהוָה יִשְׁמׇר־צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ; מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם׃  
> “YHWH will guard you from all evil; He will guard your *nefesh* (life/self).  
> YHWH will guard your going out and your coming in, from now and forever.”

רַע (*ra‘*, “evil”) in Hebrew is a very broad word: moral evil, physical harm, disaster, misfortune. Adding מִכָּל (“from all”) makes this maximal: no category of bad thing is outside the promise. But the second colon of v. 7 tightens the focus from circumstances to the core self: God will guard your **נֶפֶשׁ** (*nefesh*). *Nefesh* is more than “soul”; BDB lists “life, person, self, appetite.” It’s the you‑ness of you.

Verse 8 gives the last great merism: **צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ** (“your going out and your coming in”) for every human activity, and **מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם** (“from now and forever”) for all of future time. Deuteronomy 28:6 uses the same pair in a blessing: “בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה בְבֹאֶךָ; וּבָרוּךְ אַתָּה בְּצֵאתֶךָ” – “Blessed shall you be in your coming in, and blessed shall you be in your going out.”

So by the end of Psalm 121, the traveler who looked anxiously at the hills is surrounded linguistically: guarded in body, in soul, in movement, and in time.

---LITURGICAL-SECTION-START---

#### Full psalm

Psalm 121 is used a lot in Jewish prayer as a general “protection psalm.”

- **After the Amidah:** In many Ashkenazi and Sefardi rites, it is recited after the silent *Amidah* at weekday *Ma‘ariv* and Shabbat *Minḥah* as a kind of gentle “cool‑down” prayer, sending you out of the synagogue with words of protection.
- **Kiddush Levanah:** It also appears in the *Kiddush Levanah* (Sanctification of the New Moon), where the community stands outside under the moon and recites verses of protection—very appropriate when your psalm promises that “the moon will not strike you” (יָרֵחַ בַּלָּיְלָה).

Some Sefardi communities also include the whole psalm in the long collection of verses (*Veyiten Lekha*) recited at home on Saturday night after *Havdalah*, asking God to guard the coming week.

#### Key verses

**Psalm 121:2 – עֶזְרִי מֵעִם יְהוָה, עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ׃**  
“My help comes from YHWH, maker of heaven and earth.”

In Ashkenazi *Kaddish Shalem* (the Full Kaddish after the Amidah), the chazzan prays in Aramaic:

> יְהֵא שְׁלָמָא רַבָּא מִן שְׁמַיָּא וְחַיִּים עָלֵינוּ… וְאִמְרוּ אָמֵן׃  

And the congregation responds with our verse:

> עֶזְרִי מֵעִם יְהוָה, עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ׃  

So the personal “my help” of the psalm becomes a communal shout of trust after asking for peace.

---

**Psalm 121:4 – הִנֵּה לֹא־יָנוּם וְלֹא יִישָׁן, שׁוֹמֵר יִשְׂרָאֵל׃**  
“See, the Guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps!”

This line appears in the **bedtime Shema**. After the Priestly Blessing, we say:

> יִשָּׂא יְהוָה פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ וְיָשֵׂם לְךָ שָׁלוֹם׃  
> הִנֵּה לֹא יָנוּם וְלֹא יִישָׁן, שׁוֹמֵר יִשְׂרָאֵל׃  

You literally go to sleep under the reminder that God does not.

Ashkenazi Yom Kippur liturgy also weaves this verse into a long *Vidui* (confession), to reassure a very anxious congregation that, even in judgment, “the Guardian of Israel” is still awake and watching.

---

**Psalm 121:5, 7 – יְהוָה שֹׁמְרֶךָ… יְהוָה יִשְׁמׇרְךָ מִכָּל־רָע, יִשְׁמֹר אֶת־נַפְשֶׁךָ׃**

In many Sefardi *Pidyon HaBen* (redemption of the firstborn son) ceremonies, the Kohen blesses the baby with these lines:

> יְהוָה שֹׁמְרֶךָ, יְהוָה צִלְּךָ עַל יַד יְמִינֶךָ…  
> יְהוָה יִשְׁמָרְךָ מִכָּל רָע, יִשְׁמֹר אֶת־נַפְשֶׁךָ׃  

The psalm thus becomes a kind of “life‑insurance” blessing spoken over a one‑month‑old.

---

**Psalm 121:8 – יְהוָה יִשְׁמׇר־צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ, מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם׃**

This verse appears in some Shabbat home rituals, especially among Sefardim, right after *Shalom Aleikhem*. It is often paired with Psalm 91:11:

> כִּי מַלְאָכָיו יְצַוֶּה לָּךְ; לִשְׁמׇרְךָ בְּכָל־דְּרָכֶיךָ׃  
> יְהוָה יִשְׁמׇר־צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ, מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם׃  

Together they make the front door of the house feel very well guarded.

#### Phrases

**שִׁיר לַמַּעֲלוֹת אֶשָּׂא עֵינַי אֶל הֶהָרִים מֵאַיִן יָבֹא עֶזְרִי׃**

This full opening line appears in *Perek Shirah*, a mystical text where each part of creation “sings” a verse. The “vineyard bird” is said to sing:  

> צִפֹּרֶת כְּרָמִים אוֹמֶרֶת: שִׁיר לַמַּעֲלוֹת, אֶשָּׂא עֵינַי אֶל הֶהָרִים מֵאַיִן יָבֹא עֶזְרִי׃  

So even the birds, apparently, worry about where help comes from.

Some Eastern communities also recite this opening on Purim, right after the Megillah, as part of a short suite of protection psalms.

**הִנֵּה לֹא יָנוּם וְלֹא יִישָׁן**

This half‑verse appears inside the Sefardi version of *Nishmat Kol Ḥai* at the Pesach Seder, in a paragraph praising God as ever‑wakeful:

> וַיהוָה עֵר; הִנֵּה לֹא יָנוּם וְלֹא יִישָׁן, הַמְעוֹרֵר יְשֵׁנִים…  

It turns a line originally spoken to a traveler into a cosmic statement about God’s constant attention.

---

## REVISED VERSE-BY-VERSE COMMENTARY

### Verse 1

**שִׁיר לַמַּעֲלוֹת; אֶשָּׂא עֵינַי אֶל־הֶהָרִים; מֵאַיִן יָבֹא עֶזְרִי׃**  
“A song for ascents. I lift my eyes to the mountains; from where will my help come?”

The title שִׁיר לַמַּעֲלוֹת (*shir la‑ma‘alot*) labels this as one of the fifteen “Songs of Ascents” used for going up—either up to Jerusalem or up the Temple steps (מַעֲלוֹת can mean “steps” in BDB). Already we’re in pilgrimage mode.

The scene is simple and cinematic: a traveler stops, looks up at the ridge line—אֶשָּׂא עֵינַי אֶל־הֶהָרִים, “I lift my eyes to the mountains”—and voices a question: מֵאַיִן יָבֹא עֶזְרִי, “from where will my help come?” The adverb מֵאַיִן (*me’ayin*) is a compact “whence?” with an undertone of doubt. It’s used in poetic, stressed contexts: “מֵאַיִן לִי בָּשָׂר” – “Where can *I* get meat?” (Num 11:13), or “מֵאַיִן כָּמוֹהוּ?” – “Where is its like?” (Jer 30:7). Here it feels like: “Is there even such a thing as help for me?”

What about “the mountains”? That’s deliberately ambiguous.

- In Israel’s landscape, mountains are tough, risky terrain. Bandits and wild animals like mountains. Paths are narrow; one slip can be fatal.
- Religiously, mountains (and the “high places” on them) were famous as cult sites—exactly the sort of thing Deuteronomy wants destroyed: “עַל הֶהָרִים הָרָמִים… וְתַחַת כָּל־עֵץ רַעֲנָן” (Deut 12:2). Other nations’ gods live on their mountains.
- And yet, *Zion* is also a mountain, “הַר־קׇדְשׁוֹ,” God’s holy hill.

Radak paints the scene like this: “כְּמוֹ הַמְצַפֶּה עֵזֶר מֵרָחוֹק… וְנוֹשֵׂא עֵינָיו אֵילָךְ וְאֵילָךְ” – “Like someone watching for help from far away, who climbs the mountains and lifts his eyes this way and that, [wondering] if help will come.” The pilgrim is not making a confident theological statement yet; he’s honestly unsure.

Compare Psalm 123:1, which starts, “אֵלֶיךָ נָשָׂאתִי אֶת־עֵינַי, הַיּוֹשֵׁב בַּשָּׁמַיִם׃” – “To You I lift my eyes, You who are enthroned in heaven.” There the direction of hope is explicit: to God. Psalm 121 delays that clarity for one verse, and that delay creates emotional tension the rest of the poem will resolve.

### Verse 2

**עֶזְרִי מֵעִם יְהוָה; עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ׃**  
“My help comes from YHWH, maker of heaven and earth.”

Verse 2 answers verse 1’s question in the tightest way possible. The very first word, עֶזְרִי (*‘ezri*, “my help”), answers מֵאַיִן יָבֹא עֶזְרִי: it comes “מֵעִם יְהוָה”—“from with YHWH.” The preposition עִם means “with, beside”; *me‘im* suggests that help flows out of being in God’s presence, not out of the landscape.

Then comes the title: עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ, “maker of heaven and earth.” As we noted in the introduction, this is a classic **merism**—naming the two poles (“heaven” and “earth”) to mean “the whole universe between them.” It’s a fixed formula that shows up at strategic points in the Psalms:

- Psalm 124:8, concluding a rescue psalm: “עֶזְרֵנוּ בְּשֵׁם יְהוָה, עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ׃” – “Our help is in the name of YHWH, maker of heaven and earth.”
- Psalm 134:3, closing the entire Songs of Ascents: “יְבָרֶכְךָ יְהוָה מִצִּיּוֹן, עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ׃”

Here the formula moves the focus from particular mountains to the Maker of all mountains. It quietly undercuts any idea that a local divine power—Baal of this hill, some astral deity of that valley—might be your best bet. If your helper is the one who created “heaven and earth,” there is no realm outside that help.

In the Songs of Ascents collection, you can see a little progression:

- Psalm 121: “עֶזְרִי מֵעִם יְהוָה…” – *my* help.
- Psalm 124: “עֶזְרֵנוּ בְּשֵׁם יְהוָה…” – *our* help.
- Psalm 134: “יְבָרֶכְךָ יְהוָה מִצִּיּוֹן…” – “May YHWH bless *you*…”

So this personal confession in 121:2 reverberates outwards into the whole community and the Temple liturgy.

### Verse 3

**אַל־יִתֵּן לַמּוֹט רַגְלֶךָ; אַל־יָנוּם שֹׁמְרֶךָ׃**  
“He will not let your foot slip; your guardian will not slumber.”

Here the voice changes. We are no longer hearing “my help”; we are addressed directly as “you” (רַגְלֶךָ, “your foot”; שֹׁמְרֶךָ, “your guardian”).

The verse uses אַל plus the imperfect verb—אַל־יִתֵּן, “He will not give [allow],” אַל־יָנוּם, “He will not slumber.” Grammatically this is a “jussive” (a verb form for wish/command), but in this context it functions as an assurance: not “may He not let your foot slip,” but “He simply isn’t going to.”

The image is very physical. לַמּוֹט comes from the root מוֹט (*mot*), “to totter, to slip, to be shaken.” The classic stability line is Psalm 15:5:

> עֹשֵׂה־אֵלֶּה לֹא יִמּוֹט לְעוֹלָם׃  
> “Whoever does these things shall never be shaken.”

And Psalm 125:1 applies it to Zion itself:  

> הַבֹּטְחִים בַּיהוָה כְּהַר־צִיּוֹן; לֹא יִמּוֹט לְעוֹלָם יֵשֵׁב׃  
> “Those who trust in YHWH are like Mount Zion: it cannot be moved; it abides forever.”

Here the mountain is dangerous and the **person** is in danger of sliding off; God prevents the slip.

שֹׁמְרֶךָ (*shomrekha*, “your guardian”) introduces the psalm’s main metaphor. A *shomer* is a guard or watchman—someone whose job is to stay awake so you can sleep. Think city watch (cf. Psalm 127:1: “אִם־יְהוָה לֹא־יִשְׁמׇר־עִיר, שָׁוְא שָׁקַד שׁוֹמֵר” – “Unless YHWH guards a city, the watchman keeps vigil in vain”). Here God is that watchman over *you*.

Medieval commentators heard verse 3 as the beginning of a speech of comfort. Radak paraphrases: “טוב הוא ששמת בטחונך בה' יתברך… כי כן יעשה” – “It is good that you have placed your trust in YHWH… for thus He will do.” Metzudat David: “כאלו אחד יאמר לחבירו דרך נחמה…” – “As if one says to his friend, to comfort him…”

So the psalm stages a liturgical counseling session: someone answers the anxious traveler, line by line.

### Verse 4

**הִנֵּה לֹא־יָנוּם וְלֹא יִישָׁן; שׁוֹמֵר יִשְׂרָאֵל׃**  
“See, the Guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps!”

The little particle הִנֵּה (*hinneh*) means “look!” or “see!” It’s like the speaker pointing with a finger: pay attention to this bit.

The line uses doubled vocabulary for sleep: נוּם (*num*, “to doze”) and יָשֵׁן (*yashen*, “to sleep”). Meiri explains, “התנומה היא שינה קלה והשינה שינה גמורה” – “slumber is light sleep and sleep is deep sleep.” It’s a kind of hendiadys (one idea expressed with two words): absolutely no dozing off on the job.

This also plays against Ancient Near Eastern ideas where gods could, in fact, be asleep, absent, or periodically dead. Elijah mocks the prophets of Baal:

> קִרְאוּ בְקוֹל גָּדוֹל… אוּלַי יִישֵׁן הוּא וְיִקָּץ׃  
> “Shout louder… maybe he is sleeping and will wake up!” (1 Kings 18:27)

Isaiah 5:27 uses similar language of the army God sends: “לֹא יָנוּם וְלֹא יִישָׁן” – “they do not slumber or sleep.” Psalm 121 takes that way of speaking and puts it straight onto God.

The second half of the verse widens the circle: “שׁוֹמֵר יִשְׂרָאֵל,” “the Guardian of Israel.” We have moved from “your guardian” (שֹׁמְרֶךָ) to the national title. The individual pilgrim’s safety is rooted in God’s long‑term, covenantal guarding of the whole people. This line became so central in Jewish consciousness that it’s embedded in several prayers. In the bedtime liturgy, you say:

> הִנֵּה לֹא יָנוּם וְלֹא יִישָׁן, שׁוֹמֵר יִשְׂרָאֵל׃  

right after the Priestly Blessing—combining God’s “face shining on you” with God’s never‑sleeping protection.

### Verse 5

**יְהוָה שֹׁמְרֶךָ; יְהוָה צִלְּךָ עַל־יַד יְמִינֶךָ׃**  
“YHWH is your guardian; YHWH is your shade at your right hand.”

This verse hits like a drumbeat: the divine name twice, parallel clauses:

- יְהוָה שֹׁמְרֶךָ – “YHWH is your guardian.”
- יְהוָה צִלְּךָ – “YHWH is your shade.”

That opening repetition is **anaphora**—starting consecutive lines with the same word or phrase to build emphasis. It’s “second‑person theology”: not “God is a guardian,” but “YHWH is **your** guardian.”

צֵל (*tzel*), “shade” or “shadow,” works on several levels:

1. **Travel realism:** In the Judean hills, shade is life‑saving. Sun without shade means heatstroke. Jonah 4:6 has God appointing a plant “לִהְיוֹת צֵל עַל־רֹאשׁוֹ” – “to be shade over his head.”
2. **Protection image:** Many psalms use God’s “shadow” as a metaphor for safety. Psalm 91:1: “בְּצֵל שַׁדַּי יִתְלוֹנָן” – “in the shadow of Shaddai he will lodge.” Psalm 17:8: “הַסְתִּירֵנִי בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ” – “hide me in the shadow of Your wings.”
3. **Intimacy:** A shadow is right next to you, always in the same shape as you. Later midrash (quoted by Torah Temimah) plays with this: just as your shadow moves when you move, God’s care responds to your actions.

“עַל־יַד יְמִינֶךָ” literally “upon/at the hand of your right [side].” The right hand (יָמִין) is the standard place of strength, fighting, and honor. Ibn Ezra and others read this as military: God positions Himself right where you’re exposed in battle, covering your weapon hand. Psalm 110:5 has, “אֲדֹנָי עַל־יְמִינְךָ” – “The Lord is at your right hand; He crushes kings…”

A beautiful rabbinic spin appears in *Menachot* 33b (brought by Torah Temimah). Human kings sit inside with guards outside. God, by contrast, lets His servants sit safely inside while He stands on watch “outside,” as it were, fulfilling “יְהוָה שֹׁמְרֶךָ; יְהוָה צִלְּךָ עַל־יַד יְמִינֶךָ׃”

### Verse 6

**יוֹמָם הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ לֹא יַכֶּכָּה; וְיָרֵחַ בַּלָּיְלָה׃**  
“By day the sun will not strike you, nor the moon by night.”

Formally, this is an example of **ellipsis**: something is left unsaid but clearly implied. The second colon lacks a verb, so you mentally fill in “will not strike you” from the first: “וְ[לֹא יַכֶּכָּה] יָרֵחַ בַּלָּיְלָה.”

We have two overlapping merisms:

- יוֹמָם / בַּלָּיְלָה – “by day / by night” = all the time.
- שֶׁמֶשׁ / יָרֵחַ – “sun / moon” = the major lights of heaven.

Genesis 8:22 does something similar: “יוֹם וָלַיְלָה לֹא יִשְׁבֹּתוּ” – “day and night shall not cease.” Psalm 55:11 says of enemies, “יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה יְסוֹבְבֻהָ עַל־חוֹמֹתֶיהָ” – “Day and night they make their rounds on its walls,” meaning constantly.

The danger from the sun is easy to grasp. The verb נָכָה (*nakah*), “to strike,” is used for physical blows and for disasters; here it’s “sunstroke.” Jonah 4:8: “וַתַּךְ הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ עַל־רֹאשׁ יוֹנָה” – “the sun beat down on Jonah’s head.” Psalm 121 promises: that will not happen to you.

But how does the **moon** strike? Ancient people associated the moon with all kinds of effects—tides of moisture in the body, mental disturbance (our word “lunatic” comes from Latin *luna*, moon). Radak, thinking in pre‑modern medicine, explains that the sun dries the body’s moisture and the moon adds too much, and both extremes cause illness. So the line means: you will be guarded from day‑heat and night‑dampness, from every sort of climate‑related disease.

There’s also theology: sun and moon were major gods in surrounding cultures (Shamash, Sin). Deuteronomy 4:19 warns Israel not to be tempted to worship “הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ וְהַיָּרֵחַ וְהַכּוֹכָבִים.” Here, those impressive lights are demoted. They can’t protect you and they won’t hurt you; the real agency belongs to YHWH, who shades you from both.

### Verse 7

**יְהוָה יִשְׁמׇרְךָ מִכָּל־רָע; יִשְׁמֹר אֶת־נַפְשֶׁךָ׃**  
“YHWH will guard you from all evil; He will guard your *nefesh* (life/self).”

This verse doubles down on the root שׁמר one last time: יִשְׁמׇרְךָ (“will guard you”), יִשְׁמֹר (“will guard”). This kind of repetition, where a word from the first colon is picked up in the second, is often called “staircase parallelism”—the second line steps up from the first.

מִכָּל־רָע (*mikkol‑ra‘*), “from all evil,” is intentionally broad. רַע covers moral wrong, harm from enemies, illness, disaster. Psalm 23:4 promises, “לֹא־אִירָא רָע, כִּי אַתָּה עִמָּדִי” – “I will fear no evil, for You are with me.” Psalm 91:10 says, “לֹא־תְאֻנֶּה אֵלֶיךָ רָעָה” – “No evil shall befall you.” Our verse joins that same network of absolute‑sounding protection.

Then the focus narrows: “יִשְׁמֹר אֶת־נַפְשֶׁךָ.” נֶפֶשׁ (*nefesh*) is a famously tricky word to translate. It can mean “life,” “soul,” “person,” even “throat” in some contexts. Here, “He will guard your nefesh” probably means more than just “your physical survival.” It’s the preservation of your essential self—your life in the deep sense, not only your body.

Meiri nicely splits the promise: “הִבְטִיחוֹ בִּשְׁמִירַת הַגּוּף וּשְׁמִירַת הַנֶּפֶשׁ” – “He assured him of protection of the body and protection of the soul.” The first colon leans toward outer threats; the second, toward the innermost you.

In Sefardi practice, these lines are recited at the Shabbat table on Saturday night, as part of a chain of verses like:

> יוֹמָם הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ לֹא יַכֶּכָּה וְיָרֵחַ בַּלָּיְלָה׃  
> יְהוָה יִשְׁמׇרְךָ מִכָּל־רָע; יִשְׁמֹר אֶת־נַפְשֶׁךָ׃  

It’s hard to think of a more comprehensive way to bless someone for the coming week.

### Verse 8

**יְהוָה יִשְׁמׇר־צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ; מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם׃**  
“YHWH will guard your going out and your coming in, from now and forever.”

The psalm ends by stretching the promise in two directions: **space/activity** and **time**.

צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ (*tsetkha u‑vo’ekha*, “your going out and your coming in”) is a classic **merism**. In Deuteronomy 28:6 the obedient Israelite is told:

> בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה בְּבֹאֶךָ; וּבָרוּךְ אַתָּה בְּצֵאתֶךָ׃  
> “Blessed shall you be in your coming in, and blessed shall you be in your going out.”

The phrase can refer very concretely to battles and campaigns—Numbers 27:17 asks for a leader “אֲשֶׁר יֵצֵא לִפְנֵיהֶם וַאֲשֶׁר יָבֹא לִפְנֵיהֶם,” “who will go out before them and come in before them”—but it easily widens to mean “all your life movements.” For our original pilgrim, it would include leaving home, arriving in Jerusalem, leaving Jerusalem, returning home; for readers in every age, it covers every threshold you cross.

On the time axis, מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם (“from now and forever”) is another merism, from this moment out into an undefined future. עוֹלָם (*‘olam*) can mean “a very long time” or “eternity” depending on context. Several psalms end with this exact phrase:

- Psalm 113:2: “יְהִי שֵׁם יְהוָה מְבֹרָךְ, מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם׃”
- Psalm 115:18: “וַאֲנַחְנוּ נְבָרֵךְ יָהּ, מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם׃”
- Psalm 125:2 (also a Song of Ascents): “וַיהוָה סָבִיב לְעַמּוֹ, מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם׃”
- Psalm 131:3: “יַחֵל יִשְׂרָאֵל אֶל־יְהוָה, מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם׃”

Psalm 131:3 is especially close: there, Israel is told to *hope* in YHWH from now and forever; here, YHWH will *guard* your going and coming from now and forever. Hope and guarding match up, two sides of the same covenant.

It’s no accident that this line is standard in the *Traveler’s Prayer* (*Tefillat HaDerech*). After asking God to lead you in peace, you often add:

> יְהוָה יִשְׁמׇר־צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ, מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם׃  

You’re basically borrowing the last verse of Psalm 121 as a compact travel blessing.

So the psalm that opened with a nervous glance at the hills closes with an all‑embracing statement: wherever you go, whenever you go, the maker of heaven and earth is your guardian.
