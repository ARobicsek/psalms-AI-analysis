### INTRODUCTION ESSAY (already written for this psalm)
# Introduction Essay

Psalm 1 stands as more than an opening to the Psalter—it functions as a hermeneutical key that transforms the entire collection into a guide for navigating what the psalm calls the "two ways" of human existence. While scholars have long recognized its programmatic function, the evidence suggests something more architecturally sophisticated: this wisdom psalm operates as a theological engine that reframes the diverse genres of the Psalter through the lens of Torah-centered piety, arguing that ultimate human flourishing depends not merely on avoiding evil, but on active, continuous engagement with divine instruction as the wellspring of life itself.

The psalm's opening beatitude, "אַשְׁרֵי הָאִישׁ אֲשֶׁר לֹא הָלַךְ בַּעֲצַת רְשָׁעִים" (*ashrei ha-ish asher lo halakh ba-atzat resha'im*, "Happy is the man who has not walked in the counsel of the wicked"), immediately establishes this binary through what appears to be a straightforward negation. But the Hebrew reveals a more complex taxonomy of moral decline. The threefold progression—walked (הָלַךְ), stood (עָמַד), sat (יָשַב)—traces a trajectory from casual contact to settled commitment, while the three categories of evildoers create what amounts to a spectrum of wickedness: *resha'im* (רְשָׁעִים, the actively wicked), *chatta'im* (חַטָּאִים, sinners or those who miss the mark), and *letzim* (לֵצִים, scoffers or mockers). The BDB lexicon's analysis of *letzim* proves particularly illuminating, defining it as those who "scorn" and noting that "the scorner is proud and haughty, delights in scorning, is incapable of discipline." This isn't merely a list but a progression from active rebellion through moral failure to cynical mockery—a complete taxonomy of spiritual corruption.

What makes this opening remarkable is not just its comprehensiveness but its method. The psalm defines righteousness first by negation, creating space for a positive vision. This rhetorical strategy reflects ancient Near Eastern wisdom traditions where moral instruction often begins with prohibitions, but here the poet uses the negative space to heighten the contrast with what follows: "כִּי אִם בְּתוֹרַת יְהוָה חֶפְצוֹ וּבְתוֹרָתוֹ יֶהְגֶּה יוֹמָם וָלָיְלָה" (*ki im be-torat YHWH cheftzo u-ve-torato yehgeh yomam va-laylah*, "but his delight is in the Torah of the LORD, and on his Torah he meditates day and night").

The shift from "Torah of the LORD" (תוֹרַת יְהוָה) to "his Torah" (תוֹרָתוֹ) has puzzled interpreters for centuries. The Talmudic tradition recorded by Rashi suggests that "initially it is called the Torah of the LORD, and after he has toiled to master it, it is called his own Torah." This reading captures something profound about the psalm's understanding of study: Torah becomes internalized through engagement, not merely memorized but integrated into the very fabric of one's being. The verb *yehgeh* (יֶהְגֶּה), often translated as "meditate," carries connotations of muttering or verbal rumination—suggesting not silent contemplation but active, vocalized engagement with the text. The lexical evidence shows this word refers to "moaning, growling, uttering, speaking," indicating an embodied, almost physical relationship with divine instruction.

The psalm's central metaphor emerges from this foundation: "וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם" (*ve-hayah ke-etz shatul al-palgei-mayim*, "And he shall be like a tree planted beside streams of water"). The imagery here is precise and purposeful. The tree is *shatul* (שָׁתוּל)—not naturally growing but deliberately planted, suggesting divine intentionality rather than accident. The "streams of water" (*palgei-mayim*, פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם) evokes irrigation channels, artificial waterways that ensure consistent nourishment regardless of seasonal variation. This is not a tree dependent on unpredictable rainfall but one with access to reliable, channeled water—a perfect metaphor for the person whose life is sustained by continuous engagement with Torah rather than the sporadic influences of surrounding culture.

The tree's threefold blessing—fruit in season, unfading leaves, and universal success—creates a portrait of comprehensive flourishing that contrasts dramatically with what follows. The wicked receive exactly four Hebrew words: "לֹא־כֵן הָרְשָׁעִים כִּי אִם־כַּמֹּץ אֲשֶׁר־תִּדְּפֶנּוּ רוּחַ" (*lo-khen ha-resha'im ki im-ka-motz asher tiddafennu ruach*, "Not so the wicked, but they are like chaff that the wind drives away"). The brevity itself makes a theological point: wickedness lacks substance, depth, staying power. Where the righteous receive an extended metaphor of rootedness and seasonal reliability, the wicked get a single image of weightlessness and dispersal.

This compression serves the psalm's larger argument about the nature of reality itself. The righteous person is described with agricultural imagery that suggests permanence, rootedness, and cyclical productivity—they exist in harmony with created order. The wicked, by contrast, are *motz* (מֹּץ), the worthless byproduct of grain processing, easily separated and blown away. The Klein Dictionary confirms that chaff represents the "worthless byproduct," emphasizing not just transience but fundamental lack of value.

The psalm's conclusion moves from individual destiny to cosmic perspective: "כִּי־יוֹדֵעַ יְהוָה דֶּרֶךְ צַדִּיקִים וְדֶרֶךְ רְשָׁעִים תֹּאבֵד" (*ki-yodea YHWH derekh tzaddikim ve-derekh resha'im toved*, "For the LORD knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish"). The verb *yodea* (יוֹדֵעַ) means more than intellectual awareness; in Hebrew, knowing implies intimate relationship and active care. The LORD doesn't merely observe the righteous path—he knows it in the sense of approving, supporting, and sustaining it. Meanwhile, the way of the wicked doesn't just fail; it actively perishes (*toved*, תֹּאבֵד), suggesting not passive fade but active destruction.

The psalm's placement as the Psalter's introduction becomes clearer when we recognize its function as an interpretive grid. The laments, praises, royal psalms, and wisdom poems that follow all assume this fundamental binary. When Psalm 2 speaks of kings raging against the LORD's anointed, we understand them as the *resha'im* of Psalm 1. When Psalm 23 describes the LORD's guidance, we see it as the divine "knowing" of the righteous way. The entire Psalter becomes a meditation on these two paths and their ultimate destinations.

In its ancient Near Eastern context, Psalm 1 participates in a widespread wisdom tradition that emphasizes the moral structure of reality, but it innovates by making Torah the decisive factor. Where other wisdom traditions might emphasize natural law, social harmony, or royal instruction, this psalm insists that written divine revelation—and continuous engagement with it—becomes the source of both individual flourishing and cosmic stability. The psalm doesn't merely commend Torah study as one virtue among others; it presents it as the fundamental orientation that determines one's place in the moral universe.

The liturgical tradition has recognized this programmatic function by placing Psalm 1 at threshold moments: it opens Yom Kippur evening prayers in some traditions and appears in seasonal celebrations where themes of renewal and moral choice are paramount. The phrase describing the righteous as a tree "planted by streams of water" (*shatul al-palgei-mayim*) appears in both the Prayer for Rain and in Simchat Torah celebrations, suggesting that Jewish liturgy has understood the psalm's agricultural imagery as fundamentally about spiritual nourishment and Torah's life-giving power.

Psalm 1 thus functions as more than introduction—it establishes the theological grammar that makes the rest of the Psalter intelligible. By insisting that human flourishing depends on continuous, delighted engagement with divine instruction, it transforms the Psalter from a miscellaneous collection of religious poetry into a coherent guide for the "two ways" of existence. The psalm's genius lies in its recognition that the choice between these ways is not made once but renewed daily through the seemingly simple act of meditation on Torah, day and night.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

Psalm 1 occupies significant liturgical space in Jewish worship, appearing both as a complete recitation and through individual verses incorporated into various prayers. The entire psalm is recited during the Maariv (evening) service on Yom Kippur night across both Ashkenazi and Edot HaMizrach traditions, where it serves as a spiritual foundation for the Day of Atonement's penitential themes. In Edot HaMizrach practice, it opens a devotional sequence including Psalms 2, 3, and 24, preceding the Yehi Ratzon supplication and formal evening prayers.

Individual phrases from Psalm 1 appear strategically throughout the liturgical calendar. The complete verse "וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ וְעָלֵהוּ לֹא־יִבּוֹל וְכֹל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ" (And he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water...) appears in the Edot HaMizrach Rosh Hashanah night Kiddush and in the Mussaf Amidah for the Three Pilgrimage Festivals, reinforcing petitions for divine blessing and prosperity.

The tree imagery finds particular resonance in the Tefillat Geshem (Prayer for Rain) recited on Shemini Atzeret, where "כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם" appears within the acrostic "בֵּרַכְתּו כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל פַּלְגֵי מַיִם" (Blessed him like a tree planted by streams of water), connecting the psalm's agricultural metaphor with seasonal prayers for rain. During Simchat Torah, Sefard communities incorporate phrases about avoiding "the counsel of the wicked" (*ba-atzat resha'im*) and remaining like the flourishing tree into the Hakafot liturgy, emphasizing Torah's role in righteous living even during moments of celebration. These liturgical placements reveal how Jewish tradition has understood Psalm 1 as fundamentally concerned with spiritual nourishment, seasonal blessing, and the life-sustaining power of Torah study.

### MACRO THESIS
**Thesis**: Psalm 1 functions as a programmatic introduction to the entire Psalter, establishing a fundamental binary between the 'way of the righteous' and the 'way of the wicked' that serves as an interpretive lens for all subsequent psalms. Through carefully crafted antithetical parallelism and contrasting nature metaphors (flourishing tree vs. windblown chaff), the psalm argues that ultimate human flourishing depends not on avoiding evil alone, but on active, continuous engagement with Torah as the source of divine wisdom. This wisdom psalm thus reframes the entire Psalter as a guide for navigating the 'two ways' of existence under YHWH's moral governance of the world.
**Genre**: Wisdom Psalm (Torah Psalm) - Programmatic Introduction
**Context**: Likely a post-exilic editorial composition designed to introduce the final form of the Psalter. The emphasis on Torah study suggests a period when written scripture was becoming central to Jewish piety, possibly during the Second Temple period. The psalm reflects the wisdom tradition's concern with practical righteousness while serving as a hermeneutical framework for interpreting the diverse genres that follow in the Psalter.

**Structure**:
  - vv. 1-2: Definition of the righteous through negation and affirmation
  - v. 3: Blessing and prosperity of the righteous (tree metaphor)
  - vv. 4-5: Fate of the wicked contrasted (chaff metaphor and judgment)
  - v. 6: Divine perspective and theological conclusion

**Poetic Devices**:
  - antithetic parallelism: The entire psalm structure contrasts righteous vs. wicked through opposing imagery and outcomes
  - inclusio: The word 'way' (דֶרֶךְ) appears in v.1 (implied in 'path') and explicitly twice in v.6
  - tricolon with progression: Three parallel negative clauses showing progressive involvement: walked→stood→sat
  - contrasting metaphors: Tree planted by water (permanence, fruitfulness) vs. chaff blown by wind (transience, worthlessness)
  - temporal markers: Day and night (v.2), in season (v.3), never fades (v.3) emphasize constancy and reliability

**Research Questions** (from Macro Analyst):
  1. What is the significance of the three-fold description of evildoers (רְשָׁעִים, חַטָּאִים, לֵצִים) and how do these terms create a taxonomy of wickedness?
  2. How does the progression of verbs in v.1 (walked, stood, sat) relate to Ancient Near Eastern wisdom traditions about moral decline?
  3. What are the specific connotations of the tree imagery in v.3, particularly the phrase 'planted beside streams of water' in ancient Mediterranean agricultural contexts?
  4. How does the legal/judicial language in v.5 ('survive judgment', 'assembly of the righteous') relate to Divine Warrior and covenant lawsuit traditions?
  5. What does the verb יוֹדֵעַ ('knows/cherishes') in v.6 signify in covenant contexts, and how does it contrast with the fate of the wicked way?
  6. How does Psalm 1's 'two ways' theology function as an interpretive key for the lament and praise psalms that follow?
  7. What is the relationship between תוֹרָה in this psalm and the broader biblical concept of divine instruction versus legal code?
  8. How do the perfect and imperfect verb forms throughout the psalm create temporal perspectives on moral choice and divine response?

### MICRO DISCOVERIES
**Verse 1**
**Phonetic**: `'ash-rēy-hā-**'IY**-sh 'a-**SHER**  **LŌ'** hā-**LAKH** ba-ʿa-**TSATH** rə-shā-**ʿIY**-m ū-və-**DHE**-rekh ḥat-tā-'iy-**M** **LŌ'** ʿā-**MĀDH** ū-və-mō-**SHAV** lē-**TSIY**-m **LŌ'** yā-**SHĀV**`
The opening uses a tricolon structure with progressive verbs (walked→stood→sat) showing deepening moral compromise. Three distinct categories of evildoers are presented: רְשָׁעִים (wicked), חַטָּאִים (sinners), לֵצִים (scoffers/insolent). The verb progression suggests a trajectory from casual contact to settled commitment to evil.
  Lexical: אַשְׁרֵי, רְשָׁעִים, חַטָּאִים, לֵצִים
  Figurative: path/way metaphors for moral choice, sitting metaphor for settled commitment

**Verse 2**
**Phonetic**: `**KIY** 'im-bə-thō-**RATH** yə-hō-**WĀH** ḥef-**TSŌ** ū-**VƏ**-thō-rā-thō yeh-**GEH** yō-**MĀM** wā-**LĀ**-yə-lāh`
Sharp adversative כִּי אִם creates dramatic contrast. The repetition of תוֹרָה emphasizes centrality of divine teaching. Day and night meditation suggests continuous, not just ritual, engagement with Torah. The verb הָגָה has connotations of muttering/pondering, not just reading.
  Lexical: חֶפְצוֹ, יֶהְגֶּה, תוֹרָת
  Figurative: delight as emotional engagement, meditation as continuous activity

**Verse 3**
**Phonetic**: `wə-hā-**YĀH** kə-**ʿĒTS** shā-**THŪL** ʿal-pal-ghēy-**MĀ**-yim 'a-**SHER** pir-**YŌ**  yi-**TĒN** bə-ʿi-**TŌ** wə-ʿā-**LĒ**-hū lō'-yi-**BŌL** wə-**KHŌL** 'a-sher-ya-ʿa-**SEH** yats-**LI**-yaḥ`
Extended tree simile with multiple elements of flourishing. The phrase שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם suggests intentional planting by water channels, not natural growth. Temporal markers ('in season', 'never fades') emphasize reliability. The final clause וְכֹל אֲשֶר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ is remarkably comprehensive.
  Lexical: שָׁתוּל, פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם, יִבּוֹל, יַצְלִיחַ
  Figurative: tree as symbol of stability and fruitfulness, water channels suggesting divine provision

**Verse 4**
**Phonetic**: `lō'-**KHĒN** hā-rə-shā-**ʿIY**-m **KIY** 'im-kam-**MŌTS** 'a-sher-tid-**FEN**-nū **RŪ**-aḥ`
Abrupt negation לֹא־כֵן creates stark contrast. Chaff metaphor is minimal compared to elaborate tree imagery - suggesting the ephemeral nature of wickedness. The verb תִּדְּפֶנּוּ suggests violent driving away by wind, emphasizing helplessness.
  Lexical: לֹא־כֵן, מֹּץ, תִּדְּפֶנּוּ
  Figurative: chaff as worthless byproduct, wind as uncontrollable force

**Verse 5**
**Phonetic**: `ʿal-**KĒN**  lō'-yā-**QU**-mū rə-shā-ʿiy-**M** bam-mish-**PĀT** wə-ḥat-tā-**'IY**-m ba-ʿa-**DHATH** tsa-diy-**QIY**-m`
Introduces judicial language with מִשְׁפָּט and עֲדַת צַדִּיקִים. The verb יָקֻמוּ suggests inability to 'stand' in judgment, contrasting with 'standing' in wrong path (v.1). Two parallel statements about wicked and sinners suggest different contexts of exclusion.
  Lexical: יָקֻמוּ, מִשְׁפָּט, עֲדַת
  Figurative: judgment as judicial proceeding, assembly as exclusive community

**Verse 6**
**Phonetic**: `kiy-yō-**DHĒ**-aʿ yə-hō-**WĀH** **DE**-rekh tsa-diy-**QIY**-m wə-**DHE**-rekh rə-shā-**ʿIY**-m tō'-**VĒDH** **F**`
Causal כִּי introduces theological foundation. The verb יוֹדֵעַ suggests intimate knowledge/care, not just awareness. Perfect symmetry: LORD knows way of righteous / way of wicked perishes. Inclusio with 'way' (דֶרֶךְ) from v.1 frames entire psalm. The verb תֹּאבֵד emphasizes active destruction, not passive fading.
  Lexical: יוֹדֵעַ, דֶּרֶךְ, תֹּאבֵד
  Figurative: knowing as covenant relationship, perishing as ultimate fate

**Thematic Threads Across Verses:**
  - Triadic structures throughout (three negatives in v.1, three tree characteristics in v.3, three Hebrew terms for evildoers)
  - Progressive intensification: walking→standing→sitting and casual contact→settled commitment→scoffing leadership
  - Temporal emphasis: 'day and night' (v.2), 'in season' (v.3), 'never fades' (v.3) suggesting permanence vs. transience
  - Inclusio with 'way/path' terminology framing the entire psalm (v.1 implied, v.6 explicit twice)
  - Agricultural metaphors dominate: tree/fruit/leaves vs. chaff, suggesting natural order reflects moral order


**Interesting Questions** (from Micro Analyst):
  1. Why does the psalm present three distinct categories of evildoers (רְשָׁעִים, חַטָּאִים, לֵצִים) - do they represent different stages or types of wickedness?
  2. What is the specific significance of the verb הָגָה (meditate/mutter) - does it suggest vocal recitation, mental pondering, or something else?
  3. Why is the tree described as 'planted' (שָׁתוּל) rather than naturally growing - what does intentional placement suggest?
  4. How does the progressive verb sequence (walked→stood→sat) relate to ancient Near Eastern concepts of moral decline?
  5. What does the divine 'knowing' (יוֹדֵעַ) of the righteous way imply - mere awareness, approval, or covenantal care?
  6. Why is the chaff metaphor so compressed compared to the elaborate tree imagery - is brevity itself the point?
  7. How does the judicial language in v.5 relate to the nature metaphors - is this present reality or eschatological future?

**Synthesis Notes for Research:**
LEXICON: Focus on הָגָה (meditation), יוֹדֵעַ (divine knowing), the three wickedness terms, שָׁתוּל (planted)
CONCORDANCE: Track 'two ways' terminology, Torah meditation passages, tree/chaff contrasts in wisdom literature
FIGURATIVE: All agricultural and judicial metaphors, especially water/planting imagery in wisdom texts
COMMENTARY: Verses with interpretive challenges around divine knowledge, judgment timing, and wickedness taxonomy

**Hebrew**: על כן לא יקמו רשעים על כן שהולכים הרשעים בדרך רע בעולם הזה לא יקמו. במשפט רצונו לומר: ביום הדין, והוא יום המיתה, לא תהיה להם תקומה. | וחטאים כם גן, והוא הדין ללצים, לא תהיה להם תקומה. בעדת צדיקים: כי הצדיקים במותם תהיה להם תקומה, אבל הרשעים לא תהיה להם תקומה, אלא תאבד נפשם עם גופם ביום המיתה. ואמר: בעדת כי כשימות הצדיק נפשו עם נפשות הצדיקים מתענגת בכבוד העליון.  

**English**: Therefore wicked men shall not rise up: – Therefore, since the wicked walk in an evil way in this world, they shall not rise up in the Judgment: He means to say, in the Day of Judgment, and that is the day of death, they shall have no rising again. | Nor sinners – likewise; and it is the judgment on the scornful – they shall have no rising again. in the congregation of righteous men: for the right...

**English**: For the Lord knows the way, etc. Because He knows the way of the righteous, and it is before Him to recognize it constantly; the way of the wicked is hateful to Him, and He removes it from before Him. Therefore, the foot of the wicked will not stand up on the day of judgment, neither shall the sinners be written in the congregation of the righteous.

**English**: For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: – This verse is an explanation of the preceding; for he says in the congregation of righteous men without explaining in what sense the congregation of the righteous after death is (to be understood); therefore he interprets and says that (the Lord) knoweth; and the meaning of knoweth is “looks upon and considers with a view to doing them good.” And so...

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use (Psalm 1)

This section summarizes how Psalm {psalm_chapter} and its phrases are used in contemporary Jewish liturgy.

### Full Psalm 1 Recitation

# Psalm 1 in Jewish Liturgy

Psalm 1 is recited in its entirety within the Maariv service on Yom Kippur, appearing as an introductory supplement across both Ashkenazic and Edot HaMizrach traditions. In the Edot HaMizrach rite, Psalm 1 is positioned as the opening of a devotional sequence that includes Psalms 2, 3, and 24, preceding the recitation of a Yehi Ratzon supplication, the Full Kaddish, Barechu, and the Aleinu prayer proper. Similarly, in the Yom Kippur night observance practiced by certain communities, Psalm 1 serves as an introductory prelude to the Shir HaYichud (Song of Unity), a comprehensive devotional composition that encompasses all seven days of the week and is recited either before or after the formal Maariv service. The inclusion of Psalm 1 at this solemn juncture—the opening of Yom Kippur's evening prayers—reflects its thematic appropriateness as a meditation on the righteous path and the consequences of turning from wickedness, thereby establishing a spiritual foundation for the Day of Atonement's intensive penitential work. The consistency of Psalm 1's placement across these distinct liturgical contexts suggests its recognition as a foundational statement of religious principle suitable for the threshold of the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.

### Phrase-Level Liturgical Usage

The following phrases from Psalm {psalm_chapter} appear in various liturgical contexts:

#### Phrase: וְֽהָיָ֗ה כְּעֵץ֮ שָׁת֢וּל עַֽל־פַּלְגֵ֫י־מָ֥יִם אֲשֶׁ֤ר פִּרְי֨וֹ ׀ יִתֵּ֬ן בְּעִתּ֗וֹ וְעָלֵ֥הוּ לֹֽא־יִבּ֑וֹל וְכֹ֖ל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂ֣ה יַצְלִֽיחַ׃ (from 1:3)

# Psalm 1:3 in Jewish Liturgy

The verse "וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ וְעָלֵהוּ לֹא־יִבּוֹל וְכֹל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ" (And he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water, that brings forth its fruit in its season, and whose leaf does not wither, and all that he does shall prosper) appears in the Edot HaMizrach tradition at two significant liturgical junctures, both connected to themes of blessing and divine favor during the festival season. The phrase is incorporated into the Mussaf Amidah for the Three Pilgrimage Festivals (Shalosh Regalim), where it reinforces the petition for sustained divine blessing and successful endeavor throughout the year. Additionally, it appears within the comprehensive Rosh Hashanah night Kiddush ceremony, where it is woven into an extended acrostic poem ("Shanah Zo...") that precedes the core blessing formulas. In this latter context, the liturgy states: "אָנָּא יְהֹוָה הוֹשִׁיעָה נָּא, אָנָּא יְהֹוָה הַצְלִיחָה נָא...וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי מָיִם, אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ וְעָלֵהוּ לֹא־יִבּוֹל, וְכֹל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ" (O Lord, save us, O Lord, grant success...and he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water...), establishing a direct connection between the psalmist's meditation on righteous flourishing and the householder's prayer for blessing at the threshold of the new year. The verse's imagery of perennial fruitfulness and unwithering leaves makes it particularly apt for these occasions, where Jews petition for sustained prosperity and divine grace during the sacred seasons.

#### Phrase: כְּעֵץ֮ שָׁת֢וּל עַֽל־פַּלְגֵ֫י־מָ֥יִם (from 1:3)

# Scholarly Narrative

The phrase כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם (like a tree planted by streams of water) from Psalm 1:3 appears in Jewish liturgy exclusively within the Tefillat Geshem (Prayer for Rain), a series of acrostical piyyutim recited during the Chazzan's repetition of the Mussaf Amidah on Shemini Atzeret across both Ashkenazi and Sefardi traditions. This liturgical insertion occurs within the second blessing (Gevurot) of the Amidah, immediately before the seasonal introduction of "Mashiv HaRuach U'Morid HaGeshem" (He brings the wind and causes the rain to fall), marking the formal transition into the winter prayer cycle. The phrase is integrated into a poetic acrostic that begins with the invocation "הַגָּשֶׁם: אֱלהֵינוּ וֵאלהֵי אֲבותֵינוּ" and continues: "בֵּרַכְתּו כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל פַּלְגֵי מַיִם. גְּנַנְתּוֹ הִצַּלְתּוֹ מֵאֵשׁ וּמִמַּיִם" (Blessed him like a tree planted by streams of water; protected him, saved him from fire and from water), employing the Psalmist's agricultural metaphor to petition for divine blessing through rain. The deliberate selection of this verse reflects the seasonal liturgical calendar, as the imagery of a flourishing tree nourished by abundant water becomes particularly resonant on Shemini Atzeret, when the Jewish community formally requests rain for the coming winter. The phrase's appearance exclusively in this specialized rain prayer demonstrates how biblical language is strategically deployed within the fixed liturgy to amplify thematic coherence between scriptural precedent and seasonal petition.

#### Phrase: בַּעֲצַ֢ת רְשָׁ֫עִ֥ים (from 1:1)

# Scholarly Commentary: בַּעֲצַ֢ת רְשָׁ֫עִ֥ים in Jewish Liturgy

The opening phrase of Psalm 1, בַּעֲצַ֢ת רְשָׁ֫עִ֥ים ("in the counsel of the wicked"), appears in the Sefard rite's liturgy for the Hakafot (circuits) during Simchat Torah, the concluding festival of Sukkot observed in both the evening and morning services. Within this joyous Torah celebration, the phrase is woven into a petitionary passage that reads: וּתְזַכֵּנוּ שֶׁלֹּא נֵלֵךְ בַּעֲצַת רְשָׁעִים, וְלֹא נִהְיֶה מֵהוֹלְכֵי רָכִיל ("and merit us that we shall not walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor be among those who spread gossip"). This invocation appears as part of the liturgical framework accompanying the seven circuits of the Torah scrolls, functioning as a spiritual petition embedded within the celebratory framework of the Torah Service. The integration of this phrase from Psalm 1—a meditation on the righteous path—into Simchat Torah's Hakafot reflects the liturgical principle of invoking moral and spiritual steadfastness even during moments of festive rejoicing, ensuring that the community's joy in the Torah remains grounded in ethical conduct and righteous living.

---

#### Phrase: וְֽהָיָ֗ה כְּעֵץ֮ שָׁת֢וּל עַֽל־פַּלְגֵ֫י־מָ֥יִם אֲשֶׁ֤ר פִּרְי֨וֹ ׀ יִתֵּ֬ן בְּעִתּ֗וֹ וְעָלֵ֥הוּ (from 1:3)

# Scholarly Commentary Paragraph

The phrase from Psalm 1:3 describing the righteous person as "a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in its season and whose leaf does not wither" appears in the Sefard tradition's Hakafot (circuits) during the Simchat Torah celebration, which concludes the festival cycle on Shemini Atzeret in both evening and morning services. Within the Torah Service's processional liturgy, this verse is integrated into a sequence of moral and spiritual exhortations that frame the joyous circumambulation of the Torah scrolls, appearing in the liturgical context: "וּצְדָקָה מֵאֱלֹהֵי יִשְׁעוֹ. סוּר מֵרָע וַעֲשֵׂה טוֹב, בַּקֵּשׁ שָׁלוֹם וְרָדְפֵהוּ. וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל פַּלְגֵי מַיִם אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ וְעָלֵהוּ לֹא יִבֹּל" (and righteousness from the God of my salvation; turn from evil and do good, seek peace and pursue it; and you shall be like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in its season and whose leaf does not wither). The placement of this Psalm verse within the Hakafot emphasizes the connection between righteous conduct and spiritual flourishing, transforming the abstract promise of the psalm into a meditation on the enduring nature of Torah and its study. The inclusion of this agricultural and botanical imagery during the autumn festival season, when the agricultural year concludes, creates a thematic resonance with the themes of harvest and renewal that characterize both Sukkot and Simchat Torah.

#### Phrase: וּבְמוֹשַׁ֥ב לֵ֝צִ֗ים לֹ֣א (from 1:1)

# Scholarly Commentary

The phrase וּבְמוֹשַׁ֥ב לֵ֝צִ֗ים לֹ֣א from Psalm 1:1 appears in the Jewish liturgical tradition specifically within Pirkei Avot (the Ethics of the Fathers), the Mishnaic tractate customarily recited on Shabbat afternoons following the Mincha service, particularly during the weeks between Passover and Shavuot in the Edot HaMizrach (Eastern) tradition. The phrase is invoked in the opening mishnah of Pirkei Avot as part of a teaching that distinguishes between gatherings characterized by idle conversation and those sanctified by Torah discourse. The liturgy context presents the phrase within a broader exegetical framework: "שֶׁיּוֹשְׁבִין וְאֵין בֵּינֵיהֶם דִּבְרֵי תוֹרָה, הֲרֵי זֶה מוֹשַׁב לֵצִים, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: וּבְמוֹשַׁ֥ב לֵ֝צִ֗ים לֹ֣א יָשָֽׁב" ('When people sit together without words of Torah between them, behold this is a seat of scoffers, as it is said: "In the seat of scoffers he does not sit"'). This Psalmist's phrase serves as scriptural proof-text for the ethical principle that distinguishes righteous assembly from frivolous gathering, making it a key prooftext in the rabbinic framework that elevates Torah study as the defining characteristic of sanctified communal life. The phrase's appearance in this supplemental study material following the Mincha service reflects the broader liturgical emphasis on integrating scriptural authority with ethical instruction during the Shabbat afternoon period.

#### Phrase: וְֽהָיָ֗ה כְּעֵץ֮ שָׁת֢וּל עַֽל־פַּלְגֵ֫י־מָ֥יִם (from 1:3)

# Scholarly Commentary Paragraph

The phrase וְֽהָיָ֗ה כְּעֵץ֮ שָׁת֢וּל עַֽל־פַּלְגֵ֫י־מָ֥יִם ("and he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water") from Psalm 1:3 appears in the Siddur Edot HaMizrach as a scriptural proof-text supporting the teachings of Pirkei Avot, recited on Shabbat afternoons following the Mincha service. This usage occurs particularly during the season between Passover and Shavuot, when one chapter of Pirkei Avot is traditionally studied each week as supplemental material. The phrase is introduced within a Mishnaic discussion about the righteous person whose character remains unshaken by external forces, with the liturgy presenting the verse as biblical corroboration: "כָּל־הָרוּחוֹת שֶׁבָּעוֹלָם בָּאוֹת וְנוֹשְׁבוֹת בּוֹ, אֵין מְזִיזִין אוֹתוֹ מִמְּקוֹמוֹ, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: וְֽהָיָ֗ה כְּעֵץ֮ שָׁת֢וּל עַֽל־פַּלְגֵ֫י־מָ֥יִם, וְעַל יוּבַל יְשַׁלַּח שָֽׁרָשָׁיו" ("All the winds of the world come and blow upon it, yet they do not move it from its place, as it is said: 'And he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water, and by the stream he sends forth his roots'"). The integration of this Psalmist imagery into the study of Pirkei Avot exemplifies how the Siddur connects biblical poetry with rabbinic ethical teaching, using the metaphor of the firmly-rooted tree to illustrate the stability of character cultivated through Torah study and moral discipline.

## YOUR TASK: WRITE VERSE-BY-VERSE COMMENTARY

For EACH verse in the psalm, write a commentary annotation that draws on diverse scholarly angles:

**AUDIENCE HEBREW PROFICIENCY:**
- Your readers are familiar with biblical and rabbinic Hebrew
- When you quote sources (biblical texts, rabbinic sources, liturgical texts), provide the Hebrew original AS WELL AS the English translation
- Include enough Hebrew to support your point and/or demonstrate things of interest (unusual constructions, wordplay, idioms, etc.)
- Don't rely solely on translation—let readers see the Hebrew evidence for themselves
- NOTE: The verse text in Hebrew will be programmatically inserted before your commentary, so you do NOT need to include it yourself

**LENGTH GUIDELINES:**
- **Target length**: 150-400 words per verse
- **Can be longer** (400+ words) if there's a genuinely interesting finding or insight that merits extended illumination
- Let the content determine the length - don't pad or artificially constrain

### ITEMS OF INTEREST TO ILLUMINATE (when relevant to the verse):

The following areas are of particular interest to intelligent, well-read lay readers who desire poetic, literary, linguistic, and historical insights:

1. **Phonetics & Sound Patterns (CRITICAL)**
   - You are provided with an authoritative phonetic transcription for each verse with STRESS MARKING (e.g., `**Phonetic**: pō-**TĒ**-akh et-yā-**DHE**-khā`).
   - **STRESS NOTATION**: Syllables in **BOLD CAPS** indicate stressed syllables based on Hebrew cantillation marks (te'amim). Example: `mal-**KHŪTH**-khā` means the middle syllable KHŪTH receives the primary stress.
   - **USE THIS DATA**: When discussing alliteration, assonance, rhythm, meter, or other sound-based poetic devices, you MUST base your claims on this transcription, not on modern pronunciation.
   - **STRESS ANALYSIS**: You can now analyze prosodic patterns by counting stressed syllables (marked in **BOLD CAPS**). For example, "This verse has a 3+2 stress pattern with stresses on VŌDH, KHĀ, MĒ in the first colon and KHĀ, BĒ in the second."
   - **VERIFY CLAIMS**: For example, before claiming a "soft 'f' sound," check the transcription. If it says `p` (e.g., in `pō-te-akh`), your claim is incorrect. The transcription is your ground truth for all phonetic analysis. Distinguish `p` vs `f`, `b` vs `v`, `k` vs `kh`.
   - If you are ever providing a transcription for ANY reason, you must use the authoritative phonetic transcription provided to you; **do not make it up on your own.**
   
2. **Poetics**
   - Parallelism types (synonymous, antithetical, synthetic, climactic)
   - Wordplay (paronomasia, alliteration, assonance) - *Must be verified with phonetic transcription*
   - Meter and rhythm
   - Structural devices (chiasm, inclusio, envelope structure)
   - **Unusual turns of phrase**: When a verse contains an interesting or unusual Hebrew phrase, idiom, or construction (like הֲ֭דַר כְּב֣וֹד הוֹדֶ֑ךָ or עֱז֣וּז נֽוֹרְאֹתֶ֣יךָ), comment on it - explain what makes it distinctive, how it functions poetically, and what it contributes to the verse's meaning

   **Figurative Language Integration (CRITICAL):**
   For each verse containing figurative language where the research provided relevant biblical parallels:
   1. **Identify the image** and explain its meaning in this specific context
   2. **Cite compelling parallel uses** from the figurative language database (at least 1-2 specific references with book/chapter/verse)
   3. **Analyze the pattern**: How common is this image? How is it typically used across Scripture?
   4. **Note distinctive features**: How does this psalm's use differ from or extend typical usage?

   Example: "The 'opened hand' imagery (v. 16) appears 23 times in Scripture as an idiom for generosity (Deut 15:8, 11). Psalm 145 distinctively applies this human obligation metaphor to divine providence, transforming covenant ethics into cosmic theology."

2. **Literary Insights**
   - Narrative techniques and rhetorical strategies
   - Genre conventions and innovations
   - Dramatic progression and turning points
   - Imagery and its function
   - Irony, hyperbole, understatement

3. **Historical and Cultic Insights**
   - Liturgical setting and worship context
   - Historical period indicators (vocabulary, theology, cultural references)
   - Temple/sanctuary practices
   - Royal psalms and kingship theology
   - Festival associations (Sukkot, Passover, New Year, etc.)

3a. **Modern Liturgical Context** (IMPORTANT)
   - The research bundle includes detailed information about where and how this verse (or phrases from it) appears in Jewish liturgy
   - When a verse appears in liturgy, comment on this usage and what it reveals about reception and interpretation
   - Be specific: mention the prayer name, service (Shacharit/Mincha/Maariv), occasion (Weekday/Shabbat/Festivals), and tradition (Ashkenaz/Sefard/Edot HaMizrach)
   - Consider what the liturgical placement tells us about how Jewish tradition understood this verse
   - Integrate liturgical insights naturally - don't treat them as a separate "trivia" item
   - Example: "The placement of this verse in the daily Amidah suggests the tradition understood it as expressing fundamental covenantal theology..."

4. **Comparative Religion**
   - Ancient Near Eastern parallels (Ugaritic, Akkadian, Egyptian)
   - Polemic against Canaanite/Mesopotamian religion
   - Appropriation and transformation of ANE motifs
   - Cite specific texts (KTU numbers, Enuma Elish, etc.)

5. **Grammar and Syntax** (when illuminating)
   - Rare or ambiguous grammatical forms
   - Verb tenses and aspect (especially jussive, cohortative, imperative)
   - Word order significance
   - Difficult constructions that affect meaning

6. **Textual Criticism**
   - Comparison of Masoretic Text (MT) vs Septuagint (LXX)
   - What LXX choices reveal about the Vorlage (Hebrew base text)
   - Textual variants and their implications
   - Translation challenges and scholarly debates

7. **Lexical Analysis**
   - Etymology when theologically illuminating
   - Semantic range of key terms (use BDB data)
   - Rare vocabulary and hapax legomena
   - Technical terminology (legal, cultic, military, agricultural)

8. **Comparative Biblical Usage**
   - Concordance insights: how this word/phrase appears elsewhere
   - Development of theological concepts across Scripture
   - Formulaic language and its variations
   - Quotation and allusion to other biblical texts

9. **Figurative Language**
   - How vehicles (metaphors, similes) function in this verse
   - How the same figurative vehicles are used across Scripture
   - Target (what the figuration is ABOUT)-vehicle (what the target is likened to)-ground (what characteristics of the target are illuminated by this choice of vehicle)
   -posture analysis
   - Evolution of metaphorical meaning

10. **Timing/Composition Clues**
    - Vocabulary that suggests dating (Persian loanwords, Aramaisms, etc.)
    - Theological development indicators
    - Historical allusions (Babylonian exile, monarchy, etc.)
    - Liturgical evolution markers

11. **Interpretation and Reception**
    - *Influence of verse and their use in aggada and halacha by the Mishna, Talum, Midrashim, etc as provided in the Torah Temimah* - MAKE SURE to carefully review the Torah Temimah material in the research bundle
    - *Medieval Jewish commentary (Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Radak)* - see research bundle
    - *Jewish commentaries of the modern era (Metzudat David, Malbim, Meiri)* - see research bundle
    - Targum renderings
    - Church fathers (Augustine, Jerome, etc.)
    - Medieval Christian interpretation
    - Modern critical scholarship debates

### VALIDATION CHECK - Figurative Language:

Before finalizing, review each verse with figurative language identified in the research:
- ✓ Does the commentary cite at least ONE specific biblical parallel from the database?
- ✓ Does it use the comparison to generate an insight about THIS verse?
- ✓ Does it provide pattern analysis (e.g., "This imagery appears 11x in Psalms, predominantly in contexts of...")?

If any check fails, REVISE to incorporate comparative analysis using the database.

### IMPORTANT NOTES:

- **Relationship to Introduction Essay**: You have the complete introduction essay. Your verse commentary should COMPLEMENT (not repeat) the introduction. If the introduction discussed a theme at length, you can allude to it briefly but focus on verse-specific details not covered in the introduction.
- **Address interesting questions**: The Macro and Micro analysts have identified interesting research questions (see their inputs above). When commenting on specific verses, if any of these questions are relevant to that verse and can be meaningfully answered with the available research materials, address them in your commentary.
- **Independence from macro thesis**: The verse commentary need NOT always relate to the macro thesis - follow what's interesting in each verse
- **Reader interest**: Focus on what would genuinely interest and inform an intelligent, well-read lay reader who desires poetic, literary, linguistic, and historical insights
- **Flexibility**: Some verses may focus on poetics, others on Vorlage, others on Ugaritic parallels, others on figurative language patterns - let the verse and research materials guide you
- **Depth over breadth**: Better to explore 2-3 angles deeply than mention everything superficially
- **Evidence-based**: Ground all observations in the research materials provided (BDB, concordances, figurative language database, traditional commentaries)
- **Use research bundle effectively**: The research bundle contains:
  * BDB lexicon entries with semantic ranges, etymologies, and usage patterns
  * Concordance data showing where Hebrew terms appear elsewhere in Scripture - cite these parallels!
  * Figurative language instances showing how vehicles/metaphors are used across the Bible - use them produce insights about the intent of the poet and their selection of this figuration here
  * Traditional commentary excerpts from Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Radak, Meiri, Metzudat David and Malbim - engage with these interpretive traditions!
  * The Torah Temimah identifies instances where a given text was mined for aggadic and halachic purposes - make sure to carefully review and incorporate these materials where relevant
  * LXX text showing ancient Greek interpretation
- **Define technical terms**: When using jargon (jussive, anaphora, chiasm, inclusio, polemic, theophany, hendiadys, etc.), provide brief, accessible definitions for lay readers
- **Vary your approach**: Don't use the same scholarly angles for every verse - alternate between poetics, historical context, textual criticism, figurative analysis, etc.
- **Comment on unusual phrases and poetic devices**: When a verse contains interesting or unusual Hebrew phrases, idioms, wordplay, or poetic devices, make sure to comment on them. These linguistic and literary features are precisely what intelligent lay readers find fascinating.

### FORMAT FOR EACH VERSE:

**Verse [N]**

[150-400 words of commentary drawing on relevant scholarly angles. Include Hebrew text when quoting sources—readers are familiar with biblical and rabbinic Hebrew. NOTE: The verse text in Hebrew will be programmatically inserted before your commentary.]

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

- **Cover ALL verses** in the psalm
- **Length**: 150-400 words per verse (can and should be longer—400+ words—if there's genuinely interesting material to illuminate, such as unusual Hebrew phrases, complex poetic devices, significant textual variants, or important interpretive questions to address)
- **Variety**: Don't use the same angles for every verse - vary your approach across poetics, textual criticism, figurative language, historical context, etc.
- **Evidence**: Cite Hebrew terms, concordance patterns, research findings, traditional commentators
- **Readability**: Scholarly but accessible for intelligent lay readers (New Yorker/Atlantic level)
- **Define terms**: Explain technical terminology when used
- **Independence**: Don't force connections to the macro thesis if they're not natural - follow what's interesting in each verse
- **Emphasize the interesting**: Make sure to comment on unusual turns of phrase, distinctive Hebrew idioms, and poetic devices. These are what make the commentary valuable and engaging.
