### EDITORIAL ASSESSMENT

What works: The draft sees Psalm 4 whole. It traces the movement from plea to instruction to repose; it spots the moral center in the contrast between trust and the chase for “grain and wine”; it handles difficult cruxes—רִגְזוּ, הִפְלָה, זִבְחֵי־צֶדֶק—competently and brings the medievals (Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Radak, Malbim, Meiri) into real conversation. It also makes productive use of intertexts (Numbers 6:25; Deuteronomy 33:28) and reception (Bedtime Shema; High Holiday piyyut).

What needs revision: A few overstatements creep in. The superscription does not “declare explicitly” an evening prayer; it specifies musical performance. The tone sometimes leans breathless (“audacious epistemological claim”). Several concepts—“inclusio,” “Hiphil,” “merism,” “LXX”—are used without definition for lay readers. The figurative-language analysis is solid but can be sharpened by citing precise biblical parallels with brief patterns (e.g., “light of face,” Psalm 44:4; Proverbs 16:15; “narrow→wide,” Job 36:16; Psalm 25:17). The liturgical section is strong but needs clearer structure with subheadings and Hebrew quotations from the prayers themselves.

Missed opportunities: 
- Rigzu and the rabbinic program (Berakhot 4b–5a) deserve a crisp synthesis that shows how the verse underwrites an evening discipline. 
- “נְסָה” in v.7 should be identified as a defective Hiphil of נָשָׂא (“lift”), not “test,” and linked more tightly to the Aaronic blessing.
- The inclusio formed by צֶדֶק (vv. 2, 6) and the structural role of Selah as hinge-markers (vv. 3, 5) merit brief explanation.
- The LXX’s addition of “oil” at v.8 should be noted as expanding the Deuteronomic triad.

Figurative-language assessment: The draft cites good parallels but could more often state frequency and typical contexts—e.g., “light of your face” (rare, concentrated in blessing contexts: Psalm 4:7; 44:4; 89:16; Proverbs 16:15); “narrowness/breadth” (distress→spaciousness in Psalm 4:2; Job 36:16; Psalm 25:17). These comparisons should be used to illuminate why those same images are rhetorically effective here.

In short, the revision should moderate the tone, define terms, tighten a few claims, strengthen the figurative comparisons with specific citations, and restructure the liturgical section with precise subheadings and Hebrew quotations.

### REVISED INTRODUCTION

Psalm 4 is not labeled “evening prayer” in its heading. Its superscription—לַמְנַצֵּחַ בִּנְגִינוֹת, “for the leader; with stringed instruments”—belongs to the language of performance, not time. Yet the poem ends in the dark: “In peace, together, I lie down and sleep; for You, YHWH, alone make me dwell secure” (v. 9). The bed becomes a testing ground for theology. One can say “trust” all day; the moment of truth is whether the mind can release its tight grip when the light goes out.

The opening line condenses the psalm’s logic of prayer: “בְּקׇרְאִי עֲנֵנִי אֱלֹהֵי צִדְקִי; בַצָּר הִרְחַבְתָּ לִּי—חָנֵּנִי וּשְׁמַע תְּפִלָּתִי” (“Answer me when I call, O God of my vindication; in straits You made room for me—be gracious to me and hear my prayer,” v. 2). The epithet אֱלֹהֵי צִדְקִי (Elohei tzidqi) is grammatically elastic and theologically precise: the God characterized by righteousness; the God who establishes or reveals my right; the God who vindicates. This word returns as צֶדֶק in v. 6 (“sacrifices of righteousness”), forming an inclusio—an envelope device that signals a central theme—around plea and response. The spatial metaphor “in narrowness you made wide” recurs elsewhere to mean release from pressure: “Indeed, he wooed you out of the mouth of distress to a broad place” (Job 36:16); “deliver me from my straits” (Psalm 25:17). Here, memory of past widening gives the courage to ask for present grace.

Then the poem pivots outward and upward. “בְּנֵי אִישׁ, עַד־מֶה כְבוֹדִי לִכְלִמָּה; תֶּאֱהָבוּן רִיק, תְּבַקְשׁוּ כָזָב” (“You men of rank, how long will my honor be shamed? Will you love emptiness, seek falsehood?” v. 3). In Psalms, בְּנֵי אִישׁ (“sons of man”) often denotes the elite (compare Psalm 49:3; 62:10), sharpening the social conflict. Their strategy is the pursuit of “emptiness” (רִיק) and “falsehood” (כָזָב)—the biblical idiom for illusions that don’t hold. The poet does not simply lament; he instructs: “וּדְעוּ כִּי־הִפְלָה יְהוָה חָסִיד לוֹ” (“Know that YHWH has set apart the faithful for himself,” v. 4). The verb הִפְלָה (Hiphil of פלא) can mean “distinguish” (Exodus 11:7; 9:4) and, by association with פלא, “act wondrously.” Both senses fit: election is the wonder.

Verses 5–6 are the psalm’s moral program in five verbs: “רִגְזוּ וְאַל תֶּחֱטָאוּ; אִמְרוּ בִלְבַבְכֶם עַל־מִשְׁכַּבְכֶם; וְדֹמּוּ. זִבְחוּ זִבְחֵי־צֶדֶק; וּבִטְחוּ אֶל־יְהוָה.” The first word, רִגְזוּ, can mean “tremble,” “be shaken,” or “be angry.” The Septuagint has “Be angry and do not sin,” which Paul quotes (Ephesians 4:26). But in context, “tremble” in awe (Rashi, Radak) suits the sequence: fear—internal self-talk—silence—right worship—trust. The Talmud (Berakhot 4b–5a) famously reads this verse as an evening discipline: incite the good impulse against the evil; if not, study; if not, recite the Shema; if not, “remind oneself of the day of death”—a fear that segues to silence. The bed (“עַל־מִשְׁכַּבְכֶם”) is where the heart’s unfiltered voice is audible.

“זִבְחֵי־צֶדֶק” (v. 6) is a phrase that appears only three times (Deuteronomy 33:19; Psalm 4:6; 51:21). The tradition reads it ethically: sacrifices offered rightly—by the righteous, as part of a true turning (Radak, Psalm 51). Ibn Ezra narrows it to thanksgiving offerings (שְׁלָמִים), not guilt offerings; Malbim, reading historically, takes them as “thanksgiving offerings because David’s righteousness was clarified” (following 2 Samuel 21). Whatever the cultic specificity, v. 6 pairs deed and disposition: right worship, and a turning of confidence toward YHWH—וּבִטְחוּ אֶל־יְהוָה.

Verses 7–8 place two kinds of “good” side by side. “רַבִּים אֹמְרִים: מִי יַרְאֵנוּ טוֹב?” (“Many say, Who will show us good?”). The poet’s answer is not an argument but a counter-petition: “נְסָה עָלֵינוּ אוֹר פָּנֶיךָ, יְהוָה” (“Lift upon us the light of Your face, YHWH,” v. 7). The collocation “light of your face” is rare and charged, clustered around blessing and favor (Psalm 4:7; 44:4; 89:16; Proverbs 16:15) and echoing the priestly words “יָאֵר יְהוָה פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ” (“May YHWH make His face shine upon you,” Numbers 6:25). The verb נְסָה is best taken, as Ibn Ezra notes, as a defective spelling of Hiphil נָשָׂא—“lift,” not “test.” The point is simple: the good the “many” demand to see is not harvest tallies but the experience of divine favor. The next line seals it: “נָתַתָּה שִׂמְחָה בְלִבִּי מֵעֵת דְּגָנָם וְתִירוֹשָׁם רָבוּ” (v. 8). The preposition מֵעֵת here is comparative: “more than when their grain and wine increased.” “Grain and wine” is a merism—two items named to imply the whole—standing for agricultural abundance (Deuteronomy 7:13; 11:14). The Greek translators, hearing the Deuteronomic cadence, sometimes add “oil.” Psalm 4 resists no material good; it reduces no joy. It simply ranks them. The heart’s joy, bestowed by God, can outweigh your neighbor’s bumper crop.

The final verse returns to the bed—now as sanctuary, not battleground. “בְּשָׁלוֹם יַחְדָּו אֶשְׁכְּבָה וְאִישָׁן, כִּי־אַתָּה יְהוָה לְבָדָד לָבֶטַח תּוֹשִׁיבֵנִי” (v. 9). יַחְדָּו may mean “together” (with my own people reconciled) or “at once” (lie down and fall asleep without delay). Either way, the cause is the same: “for You, YHWH, alone” (לְבָדָד). The adverb can attach to YHWH (only You do this) or to the speaker (You make me dwell securely even alone). Deuteronomy 33:28—“וַיִּשְׁכֹּן יִשְׂרָאֵל בֶּטַח, בָּדָד”—hovers behind the line. There the nation’s security is linked to “grain and wine”; here it is located in God’s agency, even when the storehouses are someone else’s.

Two literary notes help the reader navigate. First, the poem’s Selah markers (vv. 3, 5) punctuate the argument: the first ends the accusation; the second seals the inward turn. Second, the psalm forms a quiet pair with Psalm 3. There, the speaker lays down, sleeps, and awakens (3:6)—a morning confidence. Here, the poem ends at the threshold of sleep—a night trust. Between dawn and dusk, the theology is the same: memory of past widening; instruction of the heart; a more luminous good.

---LITURGICAL-SECTION-START---

#### Full psalm

Several Sephardic/Mizrahi communities recite the entirety of Psalm 4 at Yom Kippur Maariv as part of a preparatory suite with Psalms 1–3 and 24. The placement—on a night of fasting and confession—lets the psalm’s evening logic do its work: “בְּשָׁלוֹם יַחְדָּו אֶשְׁכְּבָה וְאִישָׁן… לָבֶטַח תּוֹשִׁיבֵנִי” (“In peace I lie down and sleep… You make me dwell secure,” v. 9). Its rehearsal after a day without food underlines the argument that joy and safety are not anchored in “grain and wine” (v. 8).

#### Key verses

“רִגְזוּ וְאַל־תֶּחֱטָאוּ; אִמְרוּ בִלְבַבְכֶם עַל־מִשְׁכַּבְכֶם; וְדֹמּוּ” (4:5). “Tremble and do not sin; speak in your hearts upon your beds; and be silent.” This verse stands at the heart of the K’riat Shema al HaMitah (Bedtime Shema) in both Ashkenazic and Sephardic rites. Many versions instruct: “יאמר כל פסוק ג״פ: רִגְזוּ וְאַל תֶּחֱטָאוּ אִמְרוּ בִלְבַבְכֶם עַל מִשְׁכַּבְכֶם וְדֹמּוּ סֶלָה” (“Each verse shall be recited three times: ‘Tremble and do not sin; speak in your hearts upon your beds, and be silent, Selah’”). Its liturgical use transforms the psalm’s counsel into a nightly practice of self-examination and quieting.

“בְּשָׁלוֹם יַחְדָּו אֶשְׁכְּבָה וְאִישָׁן…” (4:9). “In peace, together, I lie down and sleep.” Many Bedtime Shema orders include this line as a capstone to the protective psalms (Psalms 91 and 3) and personal prayers, enacting the psalm’s test: can one, after confession and trust, actually sleep?

#### Phrases

“בְּקָרְאִי עֲנֵנִי” (4:2). “When I call, answer me.” In Yom Kippur Katan Selichot and fast-day services (e.g., Ta’anit Esther), the phrase appears in supplicatory strings: “עִמְּךָ מְקוֹר חַיִּים, בְּאוֹרְךָ נִרְאֶה אוֹר; בְּקָרְאֵנוּ עֲנֵנִי אֱלֹהֵי יִשְׁעֵנוּ; בַּצָּר הִרְחַבְתָּ לָנוּ, חָנֵּנוּ וּשְׁמַע תְּפִלָּתֵנוּ” (“With You is the source of life; in Your light we see light. When we call, answer us, O God of our salvation. In distress You have made room for us; be gracious to us and hear our prayer”). The pairing of “distress” and “widening” preserves the psalm’s metaphor while turning it into communal plea.

“נְסָה עָלֵינוּ אוֹר פָּנֶיךָ” (4:7). “Lift upon us the light of Your face.” In Edot HaMizrach High Holiday liturgy (Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur), the phrase is embedded in the Amidah’s repetition: “תָּכִין לִבָּם, תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ; נְסָה עָלֵינוּ אוֹר פָּנֶיךָ, יְהוָה” (“Prepare their hearts; incline Your ear; lift upon us the light of Your face, YHWH”). The liturgy hears Psalm 4 as a petition for favor rather than prosperity—a perfect fit for the Days of Awe.

“כִּי־הִפְלָה יְהוָה חָסִיד לוֹ” (4:4). “For YHWH has set apart the faithful for Himself.” In some Sephardic traditions, the line appears in Shabbat Zachor piyyutim (“Mi Kamocha”), where it is read through Esther’s hidden deliverance: God distinguishes His faithful even when providence seems opaque. The liturgical reuse emphasizes election and hearing: “יְהוָה יִשְׁמַע בְּקָרְאִי” (“YHWH hears when I call,” 4:4).

### REVISED VERSE COMMENTARY

**Verse 1**

The superscription, לַמְנַצֵּחַ בִּנְגִינוֹת מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד, gives us three coordinates: who directs (the “leader,” i.e., chief musician), how it is performed (בִּנְגִינוֹת, with stringed instruments), and whose voice it channels (David). נְגִינָה denotes string-music (BDB), and this heading recurs in several psalms (4, 6, 54, 55, 67, 76), marking pieces likely accompanied by lyre or harp. The Septuagint flattens the musical specificity into a more generic “for the end, in psalm, a song of David,” which tells us more about the translator’s priorities than the Hebrew’s intent. Medieval Jewish commentators tie the heading to temple praxis: “the one who was over the singers” (Radak); a psalm “to be recited by the Levites who conduct the melodies” (Rashi). The heading itself does not fix a time of day; the evening ambience emerges from the poem’s close (v. 9).

Two literary observations belong here. First, headings in Psalms are part of reception history: they encode how the poem was used, not necessarily how it was first written. Second, the presence of a performance rubric alongside David’s name invites a dual hearing. In one register the speaker is the royal voice—useful if one reads the psalm against Absalom’s revolt (many do). In another, the voice is that of any faithful one set apart by God (v. 4). This doubleness lets the psalm pass from court to congregation to bedside.

Finally, the heading’s juxtaposition of “strings” and “psalm” opens a small door into the poetics. Much of Hebrew verse is crafted for the ear—the terse lines balance stresses rather than syllables—and string accompaniment likely aided both memory and mood. The poem we are about to hear will move between address to God (vv. 2, 4, 7, 9), address to opponents (v. 3), and direct instruction (vv. 5–6). A leader coordinating voices and strings is not incidental; the psalm is meant to be performed as well as pondered.

**Verse 2**

“בְּקׇרְאִי עֲנֵנִי אֱלֹהֵי צִדְקִי; בַּצָּר הִרְחַבְתָּ לִּי; חׇנֵּנִי וּשְׁמַע תְּפִלָּתִי.” The line runs on the rails of memory and plea. The title “אֱלֹהֵי צִדְקִי” (“God of my righteousness/vindication”) is richly ambiguous. As Radak puts it, the poet appeals to the Judge who knows where the right lies; Ibn Ezra emphasizes causation: God is “the primary cause for revealing my righteousness.” This is not abstract attribute; it is courtroom language. And it frames the rest of the psalm, which will call for “sacrifices of righteousness” (v. 6), an inclusio that binds prayer to practice.

The second colon turns bodily: “בַּצָּר הִרְחַבְתָּ לִּי”—literally, “In narrowness you made wide for me.” The root צר (“narrow, constrict”) is the stock word for distress. The figurative move from tight quarters to open space—“a broad place where there is no constraint” (Job 36:16); “deliver me from my straits” (Psalm 25:17)—is a biblical way to name the feeling of relief when the pressure eases. It is also theology: YHWH is the one who gives room to breathe. The perfect tense (“You have widened”) anchors the plea: because You have done this, do it again.

The piling of imperatives—“Answer… be gracious… hear”—does not so much beseech as assume covenantal responsiveness. Liturgically, this opening is beloved in penitential contexts (Yom Kippur Katan; fast days), where communities splice it into strings of verses that couple “distress” with enlargement: “בַּצָּר הִרְחַבְתָּ לָנוּ… שְׁמַע תְּפִלָּתֵנוּ” (“In distress You have made room for us… hear our prayer”). The psalm’s grammar—past action yielding present confidence—has become a grammar of fast-day hope.

**Verse 3**

“בְּנֵי אִישׁ, עַד־מֶה כְבוֹדִי לִכְלִמָּה; תֶּאֱהָבוּן רִיק; תְּבַקְשׁוּ כָזָב. סֶלָה.” The address is confrontational and social. בְּנֵי אִישׁ often distinguishes “men of rank” from “sons of Adam,” the masses (Psalm 49:3; 62:10). If the historical backdrop is Absalom’s uprising, the elites’ defection explains the sting: “my glory” (כְבוֹדִי)—kingship, or at least honor—has been turned to shame (לִכְלִמָּה). Rashi quotes the taunts, “Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse?” (1 Samuel 25:10), to put content to the disgrace.

The twin pursuits, “love emptiness” (רִיק) and “seek falsehood” (כָזָב), name not just lies but insubstantial goods: a kingdom that cannot stand (Radak), strategies that have no weight. This pairing of abstractions with desire verbs (“love,” “seek”) is pointed. It is not that the elites failed to know a fact; they attached their loves to things that don’t last. The line ends with “סֶלָה”—a liturgical pause that in this psalm marks transitions. Here it invites the listener to sit with the indictment before the psalm turns to what the opponents must “know.”

The rhetoric is compact and characteristic. An interrogative (“how long?”) prods conscience; a stark binary (“honor”/“shame”) outlines the stakes; biting parallelism (“love emptiness,” “seek falsehood”) sketches the pathology. The poet will not stay in accusation. He will teach—first doctrine (v. 4), then discipline (vv. 5–6).

**Verse 4**

“וּדְעוּ כִּי־הִפְלָה יְהוָה חָסִיד לוֹ; יְהוָה יִשְׁמַע בְּקָרְאִי אֵלָיו.” The imperative “וּדְעוּ” (“know!”) answers the previous “how long?” The knowledge is not abstract; it is recognition of God’s action. הִפְלָה (Hiphil of פלא) can mean “distinguish/separate” (Exodus 9:4; 11:7) and, by connection to פלא (“wonder”), “make wonderful.” Rashi glosses “separated”; Ibn Ezra couples both senses: God both distinguished and “made known” who His חסיד is. Radak applies it to royal election: God “has separated me from all Israel to be king.”

But “חָסִיד” reaches beyond monarchy. The word, often translated “faithful” or “pious,” denotes one who embodies covenantal kindness—who does good “beyond the strict requirement of the law” (Radak, citing David’s mercy to Saul). The Septuagint renders it “His holy one,” shifting emphasis to status; the Hebrew keeps ethics in play. The prepositional phrase “לוֹ” (“for Himself”) matters: this is not generic virtue but belonging. The verse’s second half marries doctrine and experience: “YHWH hears when I call to Him.” The verb can be read as habitual present; the declaration has the tone of confidence born from previous rescues (v. 2).

A subtle literary pattern also appears. The divine name יְהוָה brackets the verse, an anaphoric emphasis that frames knowing and hearing within YHWH’s presence. The line also tightens the poem’s structure: “set apart” (v. 4) answers “love emptiness” (v. 3); “hears when I call” answers the imperative “answer me” (v. 2). The result is a compact creed: God distinguishes His faithful; therefore prayer is not shouted into a void.

**Verse 5**

“רִגְזוּ וְאַל־תֶּחֱטָאוּ; אִמְרוּ בִלְבַבְכֶם עַל־מִשְׁכַּבְכֶם; וְדֹמּוּ. סֶלָה.” Five short imperatives sketch an evening discipline. רִגְזוּ can mean “tremble” (Deuteronomy 2:25), “be agitated,” or “be angry” (Septuagint; Ephesians 4:26). In this context the flow favors awe: tremble before God, and that trembling will check the hand from sin. Then, “speak in your hearts upon your beds.” The idiom “speaking in the heart” means to think (Genesis 17:17). The bed is both literal (it is evening) and moral: at day’s end, the heart is free of the day’s noise, as Radak notes, and the conscience can hold court. “וְדֹמּוּ”—“be silent”—seals the sequence. The root דמם includes stillness of speech and body (Amos 5:13; Job 31:34). Having trembled and examined, one can stop talking.

Rabbinic tradition built a program out of this verse. “Always incite the good inclination against the evil inclination,” say the sages; if that does not prevail, study Torah; if not, recite the Shema; if not, remind oneself of the day of death (Berakhot 5a). Each step aligns with a clause—trembling, inner speech, bed, silence—and the whole becomes the nightly K’riat Shema al HaMitah. It is a striking example of how Scripture’s verbs become ritual.

Selah, again, marks a hinge. After this, the imperatives will turn outward to the cult (“offer sacrifices,” v. 6) and upward to God’s face (v. 7). But here, in the quiet, the psalmist teaches a pedagogy of the heart: reverence checks sin; the heart speaks; silence heals.

**Verse 6**

“זִבְחוּ זִבְחֵי־צֶדֶק; וּבִטְחוּ אֶל־יְהוָה.” The call to sacrifice comes with a qualifier: “of righteousness.” The phrase appears only here, Deuteronomy 33:19, and Psalm 51:21. In Psalm 51, it follows the broken heart; only then does God “desire sacrifices of righteousness.” This rarity has nourished interpretations. Rashi, reading ethically, glosses: “Make your deeds righteous, and it will be as if you offer sacrifices.” Radak insists on actual offering, but of a kind that expresses real turning: not “the sacrifice of the wicked” (Proverbs 21:27). Ibn Ezra identifies שְׁלָמִים (“peace offerings”), as distinct from sin offerings—a thanksgiving cult. Malbim, reading historically, ties it to David’s vindication after famine (2 Samuel 21): “thanksgiving offerings because his righteousness was clarified.”

The second imperative, “וּבִטְחוּ אֶל־יְהוָה” (“and trust in YHWH”), anchors ritual in disposition. The preposition “אֶל” (“toward”) is notable; it pictures trust as orientation, a turning of face and heart. The line’s pairing teaches a classical biblical lesson: right worship without trust is hollow, and trust without worship is thin. If v. 5 planted an inward practice (self-talk on the bed), v. 6 ties that inward turn to outward worship and Godward confidence.

Liturgically, the phrase has been heard in contexts where “righteous offerings” represent a whole way of life—Shabbat Musaf prayers and readings for the tribal offerings in Nissan—suggesting that the psalm’s brief imperative has long been read as summary: integrity first, then cult; and in both, turn toward God.

**Verse 7**

“רַבִּים אֹמְרִים: מִי יַרְאֵנוּ טוֹב? נְסָה עָלֵינוּ אוֹר פָּנֶיךָ, יְהוָה.” We now hear the murmur of the crowd: “Who will show us good?” The question is not only cynical; it is empirical: which side is winning? In answer, the psalmist does not argue that his side will harvest more. He prays for something else to be seen: “the light of Your face.” The imagery is compact. “Face” (פָּנִים) is presence; “light” is favor. The idiom appears in blessing contexts (Numbers 6:25; Psalm 44:4; 89:16; Proverbs 16:15) and is rare enough to mark the request as priestly in tone. Ibn Ezra’s philological note matters: “נְסָה” is a defective Hiphil spelling of נָשָׂא—“lift,” not “test.” The picture is of a standard (נֵס) raised, a banner-light lifted over a people.

This line has a long liturgical afterlife in the High Holiday Amidah: “נְסָה עָלֵינוּ אוֹר פָּנֶיךָ, יְהוָה.” There the “many” are the worshipers themselves, who know their need. The psalm’s contrast is sharp: the “good” the skeptics demand is material and visible; the “good” the faithful ask for is relational and, paradoxically, more real when other goods are scarce.

**Verse 8**

“נָתַתָּה שִׂמְחָה בְלִבִּי, מֵעֵת דְּגָנָם וְתִירוֹשָׁם רָבוּ.” The line answers the “many” (v. 7) with testimony. The verb is perfect: “You have put joy in my heart.” The preposition מֵעֵת, likely comparative here, makes the claim: this joy exceeds the joy “when their grain and wine multiplied.” “Grain and wine” is a well-worn biblical pair (a merism) that stands for the material abundance of covenant blessing (Deuteronomy 7:13; 11:14). The Septuagint sometimes adds “oil,” completing the Deuteronomic triad, and thereby making explicit what is already implied.

The psalmist is not ascetic. He does not sneer at grain and wine. He simply confesses a different arithmetic: inner joy sourced in God is greater than the joy of harvest—even (and this is key) when the harvest is “theirs.” Some medieval readers hear here the generosity of spirit Radak praises: David rejoices at the prosperity of others, even those who do him ill. Either way, the line prepares the way for sleep: joy is quieter than gloating; it frees the mind to rest.

A brief note on pattern: the root רבב—“be many, increase”—appears in this neighborhood in Psalm 3 (“How many are my foes!” 3:2) and here (“their grain and wine increased”). Enemies multiply; so can harvests. Neither number controls the speaker’s heart. Joy does.

**Verse 9**

“בְּשָׁלוֹם יַחְדָּו אֶשְׁכְּבָה וְאִישָׁן; כִּי־אַתָּה יְהוָה לְבָדָד לָבֶטַח תּוֹשִׁיבֵנִי.” The psalm closes with its most personal line. “In peace, together, I lie down and sleep.” יַחְדָּו can read “together” (with my people, reconciled; Radak takes the wish communally) or “at once” (without anxious delay), both fitting the picture of a conscience settled. “For You, YHWH, alone (לְבָדָד) make me dwell secure.” The adverb “alone” can attach to YHWH (only You do this) or the speaker (You make me secure even when I am alone). The biblical resonance is strong: “Israel dwelt in safety, alone, the fountain of Jacob, in a land of grain and wine” (Deuteronomy 33:28). Psalm 4 subtly relocates the source of that security: not in the land’s output but in God’s agency.

The Hiphil of ישׁב (“cause to dwell”) underscores the causative: the secure dwelling is a gift, not a self-construction. The line’s cadence—“lie down… sleep… dwell secure”—is the grammar of relinquishment. And so the psalm fulfills its own counsel: trembling has led to silence; inner speech has given way to rest. In the Bedtime Shema, this verse arrives as a blessing on the lips of the weary. In life, it is the last word a person needs at night: whatever their neighbor’s tallies, “You, YHWH, alone, make me dwell secure.”

—Definitions (for this verse)—
- Hiphil: a causative verb pattern (“You make me dwell”).
- Merism: “grain and wine” naming a totality of abundance.

This verse also completes the quiet pairing with Psalm 3. There, “I lay down and slept; I awoke, for YHWH sustains me” (3:6). Here, the poet lies down and leaves off before the waking, giving the last word to trust. Between them, the two poems teach a daily rhythm: morning courage; evening repose; a God who widens the narrow place.
