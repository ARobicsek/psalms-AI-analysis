### EDITORIAL ASSESSMENT

The existing introduction and commentary do many things well for an advanced reader: they are rich in philological detail, they integrate traditional commentators (Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Radak, Malbim, etc.), and they notice real poetic features (the “answer” inclusio, the “name” motif, the spatial movement from Temple to heaven, the anti-chariot polemic). The macro-thesis—that Psalm 20 is a pre-battle royal liturgy that pivots from anxious petition to confident assurance—is sound and well supported.

For a first‑year college student, though, there are several problems:

- **Too much jargon, rarely defined.** Terms like “jussive,” “Deuteronomistic theology,” “hypostatized agent,” “prophetic perfect,” “Hithpael,” “metonymy,” “antithetical parallelism,” “Sitz im Leben” appear without explanation. This is fine for grad school; it’s rough for a nineteen‑year‑old who’s just getting their bearings.
- **Density and abstraction.** The prose often reads like a journal article: long sentences, heavy with subordinate clauses and references to secondary scholarship. The big ideas are good, but they’re buried.
- **A few factual slips.** E.g., the verse 4 discussion implies there are multiple instances of סֶלָה (selah) in this psalm; in fact Psalm 20 has only one Selah (v. 4). The “cascade of seven jussives” undercounts and underexplains the actual wish-forms in vv. 2–6.
- **Missed “teaching moments.”** Some excellent data in the research bundle are barely used: the Torah Temimah on “Elohei Ya‘akov,” the liturgical re-use of key verses, the pairing with Psalm 21, and the tight theological dialogue with Psalm 33. These are exactly the things that can make a bright first‑year say, “Oh, wow—that’s cool.”
- **Liturgical section unfinished and under-structured.** The bundle gives rich information about where and how Psalm 20 is prayed; the draft barely starts to use it.

The revision needs to (1) keep the good insights, (2) explain every technical term in plain language the first time it appears, (3) use more examples and short Hebrew quotations to show patterns, and (4) adopt a more conversational, “let’s look at this together” voice that still respects the student’s intelligence.

### REVISED INTRODUCTION

#### A battlefield prayer in the Temple

Imagine you’re in Jerusalem, and the king—let’s say David—is about to march out to war. The army is gathering; weapons are being checked. Before anyone moves, the king goes up to the Temple. Priests, Levites, and people stand around him and pray out loud for his success.

That is the world Psalm 20 assumes. It’s a **royal pre‑battle liturgy**: a public prayer “for the king” before he goes into danger. But the psalm does something more interesting than just, “Please help our side win.” It stages a little **drama in voices**:

- The people (or priests) speak to the king: “May the LORD answer *you*…” (יַעַנְךָ יְהוָה, v. 2).
- Then an “I” suddenly breaks in: “Now *I* know that the LORD has saved His anointed” (עַתָּה יָדַעְתִּי, v. 7).
- Then a “we” closes it: “But *we*—in the name of the LORD our God we will invoke” (וַאֲנַחְנוּ בְשֵׁם־יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ נַזְכִּיר, v. 8).

So already you can ask: who are the “we”? Who is the lone “I”? Is that the king, a prophet, the priest, or a solo cantor? The psalm never tells you outright; you have to hear it as liturgy.

#### A quick map of the psalm

Here’s the basic structure:

1. **Superscription** (v. 1): לַמְנַצֵּחַ מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד – “For the leader. A psalm of/for David.”  
   - לַמְנַצֵּחַ (lamnatseach) probably means “for the choirmaster” or “for the music director”—a Temple professional in charge of performance.

2. **Prayers for the king** (vv. 2–6): a string of wishes in Hebrew jussive form (verbs like “may He answer,” “may He send,” that express a wish):  
   - “May the LORD answer you in the day of trouble…” (יַעַנְךָ יְהוָה בְּיוֹם צָרָה, v. 2)  
   - “May He send you help from the sanctuary, and support you from Zion” (v. 3)  
   - “May He remember all your grain offerings, and accept your burnt offering” (v. 4)  
   - “May He grant you your heart’s desire, and fulfill all your plans” (v. 5)  
   - “May we shout for joy in your victory… May the LORD fulfill all your requests” (v. 6)

3. **The turning point** (v. 7): one voice declares, “Now I know…” (עַתָּה יָדַעְתִּי) that God has already saved His anointed king.

4. **A theological punchline** (vv. 8–9): contrast between nations who trust military hardware and Israel, who trusts the divine name:
   - “These [trust] in chariots and these in horses, but we in the name of the LORD our God will invoke” (v. 8).  
   - “They collapse and fall, but we rise and stand firm” (v. 9).

5. **Final cry** (v. 10): “O LORD, save! May the King answer us on the day we call.”

So the overall movement is: **petition → assurance → bold confession → one last plea.**

#### The “answer” frame: from “you” to “us”

A neat structural trick ties the whole poem together: the verb עָנָה (“to answer [someone]”) appears at the **beginning, middle, and end**:

- v. 2: יַעַנְךָ יְהוָה – “May the LORD answer *you*” (2nd person singular: the king).
- v. 7: יַעֲנֵהוּ – “He will answer *him*” (3rd person: “His anointed”).
- v. 10: יַעֲנֵנוּ – “May [the King] answer *us*” (1st person plural: the people).

So the king is not just the object of prayer; he becomes the mediator. The community prays for him; God assures that He answers him; then the community closes by asking to be answered too. The poem performs the idea that **the king’s fate and the people’s fate are bound together**, with God at the top of the chain.

#### “Name theology”: when the Name acts like a person

Psalm 20 keeps talking about God’s “name” (שֵׁם), and it treats that name almost like a character:

- v. 2: “May the **name of the God of Jacob** keep you safe” (יְשַׂגֶּבְךָ שֵׁם אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב).
- v. 6: “In the **name of our God** we will raise our banners” (וּבְשֵׁם־אֱלֹהֵינוּ נִדְגּוֹל).
- v. 8: “But we—in the **name of the LORD our God** we will invoke” (בְּשֵׁם־יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ נַזְכִּיר).

In Deuteronomy, God says He will cause His **name** to dwell in the Temple:  
לְשַׁכֵּן שְׁמוֹ שָׁם – “to make His name dwell there” (Deut 12:11).  
This was a way to talk about God’s presence being **locally** in Zion (you can pray toward it) while still being **cosmic** (God isn’t locked in a building).

Psalm 20 plays with that idea. The “name” doesn’t just sit there; it **acts**: it “sets you on high” (יְשַׂגֶּבְךָ) like a fortress, and it’s the banner word written on Israel’s war flags (v. 6). In verse 8, “name of the LORD our God” is the alternative to horses and chariots. In other words, God’s name is Israel’s real weapon system.

Notice the progression:

1. “The God of Jacob” – reaches back to one patriarch, the trickster who constantly faced trouble and survived (hence midrash loves this: Jacob is the one who really *needed* help).
2. “Our God” – the relationship becomes communal.
3. “The LORD our God” – full covenant formula (like the Shema, Deut 6:4), the personal name plus “our God.”

The poem is taking you from **ancestor** → **people** → **covenant LORD**.

#### From “maybe” to “now I know”: the oracle moment

Verses 2–6 are all **wishes** (“may He answer,” “may He remember”). In Hebrew the grammar marks that: יַעַנְךָ, יִשְׁלַח, יִזְכֹּר, יִתֵּן, יְמַלֵּא are all forms used for polite commands or wishes (what grammarians call the *jussive*).

Then suddenly, verse 7 jumps to a very different tone:

> עַתָּה יָדַעְתִּי כִּי־הוֹשִׁיעַ יְהוָה מְשִׁיחוֹ  
> “Now I know that the LORD has saved His anointed…”

יִדַעְתִּי is past tense (“I have come to know”), and הוֹשִׁיעַ is a perfect form (“has saved / has given victory”). Nobody is saying “maybe” anymore. This is what scholars mean by a **prophetic perfect**: using a past tense to speak of something future because you’re so sure of it that you speak as if it’s already done.

Who is the “I”? Traditional commentators offer different answers:

- **Radak**: “Each and every Israelite will say: ‘Now I know…’” – a kind of idealized congregational voice.
- **Ibn Ezra**: The psalmist speaking “with the holy spirit,” i.e. inspired insight.
- **Malbim** (19th‑c.): imagines a concrete scene—messengers arrive at the Temple mid‑service with news that David has just been dramatically saved. The cantor (or priest) interrupts the prayer with: “Now I know that the LORD has saved His anointed!”

You don’t have to choose one, but all agree: **this line is the pivot**. The ritual doesn’t just ask; it also dramatizes the moment when assurance arrives.

Notice also the spatial move: earlier we prayed,

> יִשְׁלַח־עֶזְרְךָ מִקֹּדֶשׁ; וּמִצִּיּוֹן יִסְעָדֶךָּ׃ (v. 3)  
> “May He send you help from the sanctuary; from Zion may He support you.”

That sounds like the **earthly** Temple. Verse 7 answers:

> יַעֲנֵהוּ מִשְּׁמֵי קׇדְשׁוֹ  
> “He will answer him from His *holy heavens*.”

So help comes **from the building in Zion**, but ultimately it comes **from God’s heavenly throne room**. The Temple is the earthly end of a vertical line—what people like to call an *axis mundi*, a world‑axis—between heaven and earth.

#### Chariots, horses, and “the false salvation”

The most famous line in the psalm is probably this one:

> אֵלֶּה בָרֶכֶב וְאֵלֶּה בַסּוּסִים;  
> וַאֲנַחְנוּ בְּשֵׁם־יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ נַזְכִּיר׃ (v. 8)  
> “These [trust] in chariots and these in horses,  
> but we—in the name of the LORD our God we will invoke.”

This is a nice example of **antithetic parallelism**: two lines that say opposite things in order to sharpen the point. “A is true of *them*; the opposite is true of *us*.” The first colon (“these in chariots…”) and the second (“but we in the name…”) form a stark theological choice.

Chariots and horses were the ancient tank division. Deuteronomy explicitly tells Israel’s king:

> רַק לֹא־יַרְבֶּה־לּוֹ סוּסִים… (Deut 17:16)  
> “Only he must not multiply horses for himself…”

Prophets later mock those “who trust in chariots because they are many” (Isa 31:1) and call the horse “a false thing for salvation” (שֶׁקֶר הַסּוּס לִתְשׁוּעָה, Ps 33:17).

Psalm 33 is clearly in conversation with Psalm 20. Compare:

> אֵין־הַמֶּלֶךְ נוֹשָׁע בְּרֹב חָיִל…  
> שֶׁקֶר הַסּוּס לִתְשׁוּעָה… (Ps 33:16–17)  
> “A king is not saved by great army…  
> The horse is a lie for salvation…”

And then:

> כִּי בּוֹ יִשְׂמַח לִבֵּנוּ; כִּי בְשֵׁם קׇדְשׁוֹ בָטָחְנוּ׃ (Ps 33:21)  
> “For in Him our heart rejoices; for in His holy name we have trusted.”

Same central idea as Psalm 20: **the battle is decided not by hardware but by whose name you trust**.

For a tiny kingdom living in the shadow of empires with actual chariot corps (Egypt, Assyria, Babylon), this was not pious fluff. It functioned as a kind of **political theology of weakness**: we literally cannot beat them at their own game, so we will refuse to make that game ultimate. Our security is covenantal, not technological.

#### Psalm 20 in the big picture

Psalm 20 doesn’t stand alone. Right after it comes Psalm 21, which looks like a “sequel”: a thanksgiving after victory. Psalm 20 prays, “May the LORD answer you… may He grant you your heart’s desire” (יִתֵּן־לְךָ כִלְבָבֶךָ, v. 5). Psalm 21 replies:

> תַּאֲוַת לִבּוֹ נָתַתָּה לּוֹ; (Ps 21:3)  
> “You have given him his heart’s desire…”

So Psalms 20–21 together form a little **pre‑battle / post‑battle diptych**: petition and then fulfillment.

Likewise, Psalm 20 and Psalm 33 share vocabulary and themes about God’s “counsel” (עֵצָה), His “name,” the emptiness of horses, and trusting God instead. Read together, they train you to hear Psalm 20 not as a one‑time royal charm but as a **reusable pattern of trust**: in crisis, you speak Psalm 20; later, you can pray Psalm 21 or 33 in gratitude.

---LITURGICAL-SECTION-START---

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

Psalm 20 ended up not just as an ancient war‑song but as a daily Jewish prayer for help.

#### Full psalm

In many traditions (Ashkenazic, Sefardic, and Edot HaMizrach), the **entire psalm** is recited on **weekday mornings** after the Amidah, as part of **Taḥanun**, the supplicatory section:

> יַעַנְךָ יְהוָה בְּיוֹם צָרָה; יְשַׂגֶּבְךָ שֵׁם אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב…  
> “May the LORD answer you on a day of trouble;  
> may the name of the God of Jacob protect you…”

It is **omitted on Shabbat and festivals**, which are not “days of trouble.” The same full psalm is also used as an opening prayer for **Yom Kippur Katan**, the mini‑Yom Kippur service some communities say before each new month, and appears in **Tikkun Ḥatzot** (midnight lament) in Edot HaMizrach.

#### Key verses

- **Verse 2 adapted (plural)**  
  In the expanded Monday/Thursday Taḥanun, the opening is turned into a communal cry:

  > יַעֲנֵנוּ יְהוָה בְּיוֹם צָרָה; יְשַׂגְּבֵנוּ שֵׁם אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב׃  
  > “May the LORD answer **us** on a day of trouble;  
  > may the name of the God of Jacob protect **us**.”

- **Verse 10 as climactic plea**  
  The closing line,

  > יְהוָה הוֹשִׁיעָה; הַמֶּלֶךְ יַעֲנֵנוּ בְּיוֹם קָרְאֵנוּ׃  
  > “O LORD, save! May the King answer us on the day we call.”

  is famous on its own. It appears:
  - As the third verse in a standard triad at the end of **Uva le-Tsiyon**:  
    > יְהוָה צְבָאוֹת עִמָּנוּ…  
    > יְהוָה צְבָאוֹת אַשְׁרֵי אָדָם בֹּטֵחַ בָּךְ׃  
    > יְהוָה הוֹשִׁיעָה; הַמֶּלֶךְ יַעֲנֵנוּ בְּיוֹם קָרְאֵנוּ׃  
  - In **Selichot** for public fast days (Ashkenaz), embedded in long penitential sequences.  
  - As an introductory verse to **Neilah** on Yom Kippur in some rites.

- **Verse 6 reused in monthly blessing**  
  A phrase from v. 6 shapes the Sefardic **Birkat ha-Ḥodesh** (Blessing of the New Month):  

  > חַיִּים שֶׁיְמַלֵּא יְהוָה מִשְׁאֲלוֹת לִבֵּנוּ לְטוֹבָה׃  
  > “A life in which the LORD will **fulfill the requests of our hearts** for good.”

  This echoes יְמַלֵּא יְהוָה כָּל־מִשְׁאֲלוֹתֶיךָ – “May the LORD fulfill all your requests” (v. 6).

#### Phrases

- **“יִתֵּן־לְךָ כִלְבָבֶךָ” (v. 5)** – “May He give you according to your heart” is quoted in Sefardic **Melaveh Malkah** (post‑Shabbat meal) prayers, asking God to establish for Israel good advisers and to “fulfill their counsel,” ending with this verse as proof‑text.

- **Combined uses** – On some fasts and in Edot HaMizrach Selichot, v. 10 is recited immediately followed by v. 2, creating:  
  > יְהוָה הוֹשִׁיעָה… יַעַנְךָ יְהוָה בְּיוֹם צָרָה׃  
  A compact “save us / answer us” sandwich, perfect for crisis.

Through this heavy liturgical reuse, Psalm 20’s original setting—a king before battle—gets democratized. Any Jew on a “day of trouble” can step into the drama: “Answer **us** in our day of calling.”

### REVISED VERSE COMMENTARY

---

**Verse 1**

לַמְנַצֵּ֗חַ; מִזְמ֥וֹר לְדָוִֽד׃  
“For the leader. A psalm of David.”

The superscription is short, but it tells you a lot about how this poem was used.

לַמְנַצֵּחַ (lamnatseach) comes from the root נ־צ־ח, which can mean “to be pre‑eminent” or “to supervise.” In the Psalms it almost always appears in headings and in Chronicles for Levitical officials in charge of music. So most scholars (and traditional commentators like Ibn Ezra) take it as “for the choirmaster / music director”: this psalm was handed to a professional who would lead it in the Temple service.

The Greek Septuagint (an ancient translation) renders it εἰς τὸ τέλος, “unto the end,” which early Christian writers read as “about the end times.” That’s interesting historically, but in the original setting, the musical/liturgical meaning is more straightforward.

מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד (mizmor le-David) raises the classic lamed‑question: does it mean “by David,” “for David,” or “about David”? Grammatically all three are possible. Here, the content pushes you toward “for/about David”:

- In vv. 2–6 **someone else** speaks to a singular “you” who is going out to battle.
- In v. 7 that “you” is called “His anointed” (מְשִׁיחוֹ), a standard way to refer to the Davidic king.
- Meiri (a 13th‑c. commentator) explicitly says: “David composed this so that the Levites would say it **about him** whenever he went out to war.”

So the heading probably doesn’t mean “David wrote this for his personal devotions,” but something like, “A psalm framed around David, to be performed under the choirmaster.” That already tells you this is **public liturgy**, not private diary.

---

**Verse 2**

יַעַנְךָ יְהוָה בְּיוֹם צָרָה;  
יְשַׂגֶּבְךָ שֵׁם אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב׃  

“May the LORD answer you on a day of trouble;  
may the name of the God of Jacob set you securely on high.”

Right away we enter the liturgical language of blessing. יַעַנְךָ (ya‘ancha) is a **jussive** form—Hebrew’s way of saying “may He answer you,” a wish rather than a description. The subject “the LORD” (יְהוָה) comes after the verb in Hebrew, but the sense is clear: the community is asking God to respond favorably to the king’s prayer.

“Day of trouble” (בְּיוֹם צָרָה) is a stock phrase for acute crisis, often military. Compare Psalm 50:15:  

> וּקְרָאֵנִי בְּיוֹם צָרָה; אֲחַלֶּצְךָ וּתְכַבְּדֵנִי׃  
> “Call on Me on a day of trouble; I will rescue you, and you will honor Me.”

What’s striking is the second half: “may the **name** of the God of Jacob keep you safe.” Grammatically, שֵׁם אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב (“the name of the God of Jacob”) is the subject of יְשַׂגֶּבְךָ (“may [He/it] set you safely on high”). It’s not “may God, who has a name, protect you,” but “may the **name** itself protect you.”

This reflects the Deuteronomic idea that God causes His **name** to dwell in the Temple (Deut 12:11: לְשַׁכֵּן שְׁמוֹ שָׁם). God in His essence is not boxed into Jerusalem, but His name—His revealed identity and reputation—is there in a focused way. So to be protected “by the name” is to be sheltered by God’s **public, covenantal identity**.

Why “the God of Jacob” and not “of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob”? Radak notes: Jacob lived through more visible “troubles” than the other patriarchs—Esau, Laban, fear of Esau again, famine, loss of Joseph. Midrash (quoted by Torah Temimah) picks this up with a vivid image: just as Jacob was saved even when he was pressed **into the beam** (there’s a saying: “from here, to the beam‑carrier who goes into the thickness of the beam”), so God saves you when you’re wedged into tight spots.

Liturgically, this verse lives on in the plural form:  

> יַעֲנֵנוּ יְהוָה בְּיוֹם צָרָה; יְשַׂגְּבֵנוּ שֵׁם אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב׃  
> “May the LORD answer **us** on a day of trouble; may the name of the God of Jacob protect **us**.”

That line is said in Taḥanun as a communal plea. What was once a royal blessing—“you, the king”—becomes available to everyone.

---

**Verse 3**

יִשְׁלַח־עֶזְרְךָ מִקֹּדֶשׁ;  
וּמִצִּיּוֹן יִסְעָדֶךָּ׃  

“May He send you help from the sanctuary;  
from Zion may He support you.”

Notice the geography. There are two **“from”** phrases (both with מִן):

- מִקֹּדֶשׁ (miqqodesh) – “from the sanctuary,” i.e., from the holy place.
- וּמִצִּיּוֹן (u-miTsiyon) – “and from Zion,” the hill in Jerusalem where the Temple stands.

Radak glosses: “From the holy place, where the ark was; for there is the Glory, and from there He will send your help in battle.” So קֹדֶשׁ here is likely “the holy place” of the Temple, and “Zion” then names the larger sacred hill on which that building sits. The two lines work from **inside out**: inner shrine → the whole mount.

The verbs are also interesting:

- יִשְׁלַח (yishlach) – “may He **send**,” a very active, almost military verb (you send troops, messengers, help).
- יִסְעָדֶךָּ (yis‘adekha) – from סעד, “to support, sustain, hold up.” In prose it can mean “sustain the heart with food” (Gen 18:5); here it has a more martial feel: “may He be your backup.”

So the picture is: the king is out on campaign; the Temple is behind him, literally and spiritually. From that building in Zion, help is “sent” and ongoing support “upholds” him.

Verse 7 will “zoom out” even further and say God answers “from His holy heavens” (מִשְּׁמֵי קׇדְשׁוֹ). That doesn’t contradict this verse; it deepens it. The Temple in Zion is the **earthly end** of heavenly help.

---

**Verse 4**

יִזְכֹּר כָּל־מִנְחֹתֶךָ;  
וְעֹלָתְךָ יְדַשְּׁנֶה סֶלָה׃  

“May He remember all your grain offerings;  
and your burnt offering may He make fat. Selah.”

Now we’re at the sacrificial part of the liturgy. Two specific offerings are named:

- מִנְחָה (minchah) – usually a **grain offering**: fine flour with oil and frankincense (see Leviticus 2).
- עֹלָה (‘olah) – the **burnt offering**, an animal wholly consumed on the altar (Leviticus 1).

To “remember” (יִזְכֹּר, yizkor) in biblical Hebrew is never just “Oh right, I forgot that.” When God “remembers” Noah, the floodwaters go down (Gen 8:1). When He “remembers” His covenant, the Exodus begins (Exod 2:24). So “may He remember all your minchot” means “may He take those deeds into account now and act to help you.”

The second verb is the fun one: יְדַשְּׁנֶה (yedashs̆eneh), from דָשֵׁן (dashen), “to be/make fat.” BDB notes that in this context it’s a vivid **anthropomorphism**—language that describes God in bodily terms. The idea is: “May He **treat your burnt offering as fat**, i.e. rich and pleasing.” Rashi paraphrases: “He will accept them willingly like fat burnt offerings.”

So the line pictures God as a kind of heavenly diner who smells the rich smoke and is pleased. Obviously no one thinks God literally eats; the image communicates **favor**: your offering is rich, delightful, fully accepted.

סֶלָה (Selah) is one of those opaque musical markers. It likely signals a pause or a musical interlude. Here it comes right after the sacrificial scene, as if to say: stop and let the picture of smoke rising, God “remembering,” and accepting the offering sink in before the prayer moves on.

Also notice that Psalm 20 has **only this one Selah**, right here in verse 4. That places a little stress mark in the psalm: after we’ve invoked God’s name and location (vv. 2–3) and brought sacrifices (v. 4), we pause. Next come requests for strategy and success.

---

**Verse 5**

יִתֵּן־לְךָ כִלְבָבֶךָ;  
וְכָל־עֲצָתְךָ יְמַלֵּא׃  

“May He grant you according to your heart;  
and may He fulfill all your plan.”

We move from the Temple courtyard inward—to the king’s **inner life**.

כִלְבָבֶךָ (kilvavekha) literally means “according to your heart.” In idiomatic English: “your heart’s desire.” A parallel in Psalm 21, clearly echoing this verse, says:  

> תַּאֲוַת לִבּוֹ נָתַתָּה לּוֹ (Ps 21:3)  
> “You have given him his heart’s desire.”

So the people are asking that what the king *truly wants* be granted. That immediately raises a worry: what if the king’s heart is corrupt? Midrash, noticed by Radak, solves this cleverly: we only say such a blessing to someone like David, “who was wholehearted before his Creator.” To ordinary mortals you don’t say, “May God give you exactly what’s in your heart,” because sometimes what’s in there is theft, lust, or worse.

The second line moves from raw desire to thought‑out strategy: עֲצָה (etzah) means “counsel, plan.” It can be your own deliberation or the joint advice of your war‑council. “May He **fulfill** (יִמַלֵּא, yimale’) all your counsel” uses the verb מלא (“to fill, complete”). The image is of a plan being brought to full completion.

This verse is beautifully balanced with verse 6, which ends:

> יְמַלֵּא יְהוָה כָּל־מִשְׁאֲלוֹתֶיךָ׃  
> “May the LORD fulfill all your requests.”

In v. 5 the focus is on **inner planning** (עֲצָה); in v. 6 on **spoken requests** (מִשְׁאֲלוֹת). Both use כָּל (“all”) and the same verb יְמַלֵּא. That repetition hammers home the wish for *complete* divine backing—of the king’s thoughts and his prayers.

Malbim, reading very historically, imagines singers saying this **after** hearing news of David’s deliverance: “What was in your heart has been granted; your counsel—to rely on God rather than on chariots—has been fulfilled.” Whether or not you buy that reconstruction, it’s a nice example of how the psalm’s phrases could be heard both as **before‑battle wishes** and **after‑battle interpretations**.

---

**Verse 6**

נְרַנְּנָה בִישׁוּעָתֶךָ;  
וּבְשֵׁם־אֱלֹהֵינוּ נִדְגֹּל;  
יְמַלֵּא יְהוָה כָּל־מִשְׁאֲלוֹתֶיךָ׃  

“Let us shout for joy in your victory;  
and in the name of our God let us raise our banners.  
May the LORD fulfill all your requests.”

Here the grammar shifts: נְרַנְּנָה (nərannənah) is **cohortative** (“let us shout / we will surely shout”), and we finally hear a **first‑person plural**: “we.” Up to now, the “you” (singular) has been the king; now the supporters step into the frame: your victory will be **our celebration**.

The word root ר־נ־ן means “to shout or sing loudly,” usually in joy. “Your victory” (יְשׁוּעָתֶךָ) starts a cluster of salvation words (it’s from the same root as יֵשַׁע in v. 7 and הוֹשִׁיעָה in v. 10).

The hapax verb נִדְגֹּל (nidgol) deserves a moment. Its root ד־ג־ל gives us דֶּגֶל (degel), a “banner” or “standard,” especially a military flag (cf. Numbers 2 and 10, where each tribe camps and marches “under its degel”). The form here is probably a *hitpael*‑like form (“we will banner ourselves”) but functionally means “we will march / rally under banners.”

What kind of banners? The prepositional phrase tells you: “in the name of our God” (וּבְשֵׁם־אֱלֹהֵינוּ). Rashi reads it as “we will assemble and gain strength.” Radak and Malbim imagine actual standards carried into battle with God’s name written on them. Either way, the idea is that the **visible symbol** of the army’s identity is not the king’s personal crest but God’s name.

The last line repeats and amplifies v. 5: “May the LORD fulfill (יְמַלֵּא) all your requests (מִשְׁאֲלוֹתֶיךָ).” So verses 5–6 form a little **triplet**:

- May He give what’s in your heart (inner desire).
- May He fulfill all your counsel (careful planning).
- May He fulfill all your requests (spoken prayers).

Liturgically, the phrase “יְמַלֵּא יְהוָה מִשְׁאֲלוֹת לִבֵּנוּ לְטוֹבָה” (“May the LORD fulfill the requests of our hearts for good”) in the monthly Birkat ha-Ḥodesh prayer is built out of this verse: it takes the royal language and applies it to everyone in the synagogue.

**Verse 7**

עַתָּה יָדַעְתִּי כִּי הוֹשִׁיעַ יְהוָה מְשִׁיחוֹ;  
יַעֲנֵהוּ מִשְּׁמֵי קׇדְשׁוֹ;  
בִּגְבֻרוֹת יֵשַׁע יְמִינוֹ׃  

“Now I know that the LORD has saved His anointed;  
He will answer him from His holy heavens,  
with the mighty victories of His right hand.”

This is the psalm’s hinge. עַתָּה (attah) means “now”—but here not just “at this point in time” but “now, on the basis of what we have just seen/heard.” יָדַעְתִּי is past/perfect (“I have come to know”). Grammarians sometimes call this usage the **“perfect of confidence”** or **prophetic perfect**: you describe a future certainty as if it’s already occurred.

The “I” is unnamed. Options:

- A **prophet** delivering an oracle of salvation in the middle of the liturgy.
- The **king himself**, testifying that he has received assurance.
- A **solo singer** speaking on behalf of the worshiping community.

Traditional Jewish commentators are deliberately non‑committal. Ibn Ezra says, “Each and every person will say thus, or these are the words of the poet with the holy spirit.” Radak: “Each and every one of Israel will say: ‘Now I know.’” Malbim imagines an actual report arriving mid‑service, prompting this cry.

“His anointed” (מְשִׁיחוֹ, meshicho) is key. The noun מָשִׁיחַ (mashiach) simply means “anointed one,” someone anointed with oil for office—usually a **king**, sometimes a high priest. Here it clearly refers to the Davidic king we’ve been praying for. The suffix “His” stresses ownership: the king isn’t a freelance tyrant; he belongs to YHWH.

Spatially, we’ve climbed from:

- מִקֹּדֶשׁ (“from the sanctuary,” v. 3),
- to מִצִּיּוֹן (“from Zion,” v. 3),
- to מִשְּׁמֵי קׇדְשׁוֹ (“from His holy heavens,” here).

The answer originates not in the building but in God’s own realm.

Finally, vivid divine‑warrior imagery: בִּגְבֻרוֹת יֵשַׁע יְמִינוֹ – literally, “with the mighty deeds of salvation of His right hand.” God’s **right hand** is a standard metaphor for His power. Think of the Song at the Sea:

> יְמִינְךָ יְהוָה נֶאְדָּרִי בַּכֹּחַ; יְמִינְךָ יְהוָה תִּרְעַץ אוֹיֵב׃ (Exod 15:6)  
> “Your right hand, O LORD, glorious in power; Your right hand, O LORD, shatters the enemy.”

So v. 7 says: I now know that the king’s survival and victory are not luck or clever tactics; they are the visible imprint of **God’s right hand** acting in history.

**Verse 8**

אֵלֶּה בָרֶכֶב וְאֵלֶּה בַסּוּסִים;  
וַאֲנַחְנוּ בְּשֵׁם־יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ נַזְכִּיר׃  

“These trust in chariots and these in horses;  
but we—in the name of the LORD our God we will invoke.”

Formally this is classic **antithetic parallelism**: the two halves state contrasting realities to make the point sharp.

- “These” (אֵלֶּה… וְאֵלֶּה) – deictic, pointing to generic other nations.
- “But we” (וַאֲנַחְנוּ) – emphatic contrast: not them; us.

רֶכֶב (rekhev) = chariotry; סוּסִים (susim) = horses. In the ancient Near East, that is your high‑tech strike force. Deuteronomy 17:16 forbids Israel’s king to “multiply horses,” precisely so he won’t rely on Egyptian‑style military buildup.

The controversial word is נַזְכִּיר (nazkir). It’s a Hif‘il form of זכר, which in various stems can mean “remember,” “mention,” “invoke,” or even “proclaim.” Rashi, connecting it with sacrificial language like מַזְכִּיר לְבוֹנָה (“he who burns/causes to be remembered incense,” Isa 66:3), takes it as “invoke in prayer and sacrificial worship.” Others (and the Greek Septuagint’s μεγαλυνθησόμεθα, “we will be magnified/boast”) hear “we will boast in the name of the LORD.”

Probably you don’t have to choose. In Hebrew religious culture, to “mention” God’s name is to **call on** Him, and that act of calling is also the thing you “boast in.” So the line says: their war‑confidence rides on iron and horseflesh; ours rides on **invoking God’s name**.

Theologically, this verse pairs almost perfectly with Psalm 33:16–17:

> אֵין־הַמֶּלֶךְ נוֹשָׁע בְּרֹב חָיִל…  
> שֶׁקֶר הַסּוּס לִתְשׁוּעָה…  
> “A king is not saved by great army…  
> The horse is a lie for salvation…”

Both psalms insist that conventional military power is a **שֶׁקֶר (“lie, illusion”)** when treated as ultimate security. That doesn’t mean you literally disband the cavalry; it means you refuse to **worship** it.

**Verse 9**

הֵמָּה כָּרְעוּ וְנָפָלוּ;  
וַאֲנַחְנוּ קַמְנוּ וַנִּתְעוֹדָד׃  

“They collapse and fall;  
but we rise and are strengthened.”

If verse 8 was the principle, verse 9 is the **outcome**. Note the same contrast pair: הֵמָּה (“they”) vs. וַאֲנַחְנוּ (“but we”).

The verbs for “them”:

- כָּרְעוּ (kar‘u) – “they have knelt / collapsed.” The root כרע can mean to kneel in worship or to buckle under weight. In Isaiah 46:2, it’s used of Babylon’s idols:  
  > קָרְסוּ כָרְעוּ יַחְדָּו…  
  > “They cower, they bow down together…”
- נָפָלוּ (naflu) – “they have fallen.”

Both are in perfect form, as if the collapse has already happened. Like v. 7, this is likely another **prophetic perfect**: the community is so sure of the outcome that they speak of the enemy’s defeat as a done deal.

For “us”:

- קַמְנוּ (qamnu) – “we have risen / stood up.” Antonym of נפל.
- וַנִּתְעוֹדָד (vanit‘odad) – a rare hitpael form from עוד. BDB glosses it as “be restored, strengthened.” The same root in a different stem appears in Psalms 146:9 and 147:6 of God as “one who raises up (מְעוֹדֵד) the lowly.” Here, the reflexive form suggests, “we find ourselves strengthened / restored to full stance.”

The sound also does some work. כָּרְעוּ וְנָפָלוּ has a falling rhythm with its final ‑u vowels; קַמְנוּ וַנִּתְעוֹדָד ends with a firm ‑ad, giving a sense of solidity. You can almost hear the clatter of armor as one side crashes and the thud of boots as the other regroups.

Malbim refuses to treat קַמְנוּ and וַנִּתְעוֹדָד as synonyms. For him, “we rose” = we survived the assault; “we were strengthened” = we went on to thrive beyond our previous state—in wealth, stability, and success. Whether you follow that or not, the verse clearly declares: **trust in God’s name produces not just survival but renewed strength**, while trust in weapons leads to humiliating collapse.

**Verse 10**

יְהוָה הוֹשִׁיעָה;  
הַמֶּלֶךְ יַעֲנֵנוּ בְיוֹם־קׇרְאֵנוּ׃  

“O LORD, save!  
May the King answer us on the day we call.”

The psalm ends by circling back to **petition**, but with a twist.

First line: יְהוָה הוֹשִׁיעָה (Adonai hoshia‘ah) – “O LORD, save!” The verb is an imperative with a softening יָה (“please” / “do it!”). This is the same root as יְשׁוּעָה (“victory/salvation”) in v. 6 and הוֹשִׁיעַ (“has saved”) in v. 7.

Second line: הַמֶּלֶךְ יַעֲנֵנוּ בְיוֹם־קׇרְאֵנוּ – literally, “the king will/ may answer us on the day we call.” Here’s the ambiguity: who is **“the king”**?

- Many traditional commentators (Ibn Ezra, Radak, Meiri) say: it’s God. Only God is truly “the King,” so you read it as two addresses to the same subject: “O LORD, save! O King, answer us…” In English you might supply the “O”: “O King, answer us…”
- Others, including some modern readers and Malbim in one of his explanations, take “the King” to be the **human king** we’ve been praying for. Then the sense is: “O LORD, save; may the king answer us when we call.” In other words, may our divinely saved king be responsive to his people.

Hebrew orthography and accents don’t settle it. The Masoretic accent (a disjunctive on הוֹשִׁיעָה) suggests a pause between “LORD, save!” and “the king will answer us…,” but doesn’t tell you whether “the king” is divine or human.

It might well be **intended to do both at once**. Throughout the psalm, the king is “His anointed,” the human through whom God’s saving power flows to the people. To say “the King will answer us” as you look at both God and His anointed is fully in line with biblical royal ideology (2 Sam 7:14: “I will be to him a father, and he shall be to Me a son”).

The phrase “on the day we call” (בְיוֹם־קׇרְאֵנוּ) answers back to v. 2’s “on a day of trouble” (בְּיוֹם צָרָה). At the start, the day is defined by **trouble** coming from outside; by the end, it is defined by **calling** coming from Israel. The core hope of the psalm is that whenever that day comes—battlefield fear, national crisis, personal pain—there will be an answering King.

No wonder this line became a go‑to cry in the prayerbook: it compresses the whole psalm’s theology into one sentence: **we are in trouble; we call; may the true King answer.**
