### EDITORIAL ASSESSMENT

The draft rightly treats Psalm 1 as an architectural threshold to the Psalter, and it makes several strong moves: the “two ways” frame is clear; the treatment of שָׁתוּל (shā-THŪL, “transplanted”) and פַלְגֵי־מָיִם (pal-ghēy-MĀ-yim, “water channels”) is accurate and illuminating; the shift from “Torah of YHWH” to “his Torah” is well read through Rashi and rabbinic tradition; and the liturgical notices are a valuable, underused strand.

That said, the essay needs tightening and some corrections. Most pressing: it claims “the wicked receive exactly four Hebrew words,” which is simply false (v. 4 is longer, and the brevity point stands without the error). The tone sometimes turns breathless (“theological engine”), when the psalm’s spare craft speaks best for itself. Some scholarly terms (e.g., “merism,” “inclusio”) are used without definition for general readers. The phonetic analysis notes “stress pattern” vaguely; if we comment on sound, we should use the provided phonetics (e.g., the triple anaphora of לֹא, LŌ’, in v. 1). The LXX deserves a clearer glance: its “καθέδρα λοιμῶν” (“seat of pestilent [men]”) broadens לֵצִים (lē-TSIY-m, “scoffers”) in a revealing way, and μελετᾶν (“to study, practice”) nuances יֶהְגֶּה (yeh-GEH). 

Missed opportunities: (1) the editorial seam with Psalm 2 (“אַשְׁרֵי” inclusio at 1:1 and 2:12) that frames the opening diptych; (2) explicit parallels to the Bible’s “path” metaphor (Deuteronomy 5:29–30; 11:28; Proverbs 4:18–19), confirming that “way” (דֶּרֶךְ, DE-rekh) is a moral itinerary; (3) the figurative patterning of “chaff” (מֹּץ, MŌTS) across Psalms 35:5 and 83:14 and Isaiah 41:2; (4) verse 5’s irony (“did not stand” in v. 1 // “will not stand” in judgment) and Malbim’s smart distinction between רְשָׁעִים (rə-shā-ʿIY-m, hardened wicked) and חַטָּאִים (ḥat-tā-’IY-m, strayers). Liturgy should be structured more clearly, with Hebrew prayer citations and why they matter. 

In revision, we will: correct errors; define terms; integrate LXX and sound where they actually help; fold in the “Psalms 1–2” seam; deepen verse-by-verse with concrete Hebrew, figurative parallels, and liturgical reception; and smooth the tone for an intelligent lay audience.

### REVISED INTRODUCTION

Open the Psalter and you are not yet praying; you are being taught how to pray. Psalm 1 is instruction first, devotion after. It lays out the “two ways” with a clarity that is almost austere, then hands you a set of images—roads, a tree, chaff—to carry through the rest of the book. Its simplicity is deceptive. The poem does not argue in abstractions; it narrates a moral trajectory you can feel in your legs: “Happy the person” (אַשְׁרֵי־הָאִישׁ, `'ash-rēy-hā-'IY-sh`) who does not walk, stand, sit where evil thrives (v. 1). The verbs mark a slide from motion to stasis, from passing contact to settled identity. And then comes the positive counter-movement: a delight (חֵפֶץ, ḥef-TSŌ) in Torah that becomes daily practice, “day and night” (יוֹמָם וָלָיְלָה, yō-MĀM wā-LĀ-ye-lāh), a merism—two poles that mean “always.”

Two small details carry large freight. First, the Torah is “of YHWH” (תּוֹרַת יְהוָה) and, in the next breath, “his Torah” (תּוֹרָתוֹ). As Rashi already noted, the shift signals internalization: what begins as divine instruction becomes one’s own through labor and love. Rabbinic tradition pushes this further. In a debate about whether a teacher’s honor can be waived, Rava finally says it cannot be—then qualifies: “Is the Torah his? Indeed not… for it is written, ‘and in his Torah he meditates day and night’” (Kiddushin 32a). The paradox holds: Torah remains God’s gift even as it becomes one’s possession.

Second, the verb for study, יֶהְגֶּה (yeh-GEH), is bodily. Brown–Driver–Briggs glosses it as “moan, growl, utter, muse.” It is the sound of low recitation, the lips moving; Joshua 1:8 uses the same verb for the daily discipline that keeps the covenantal way. The ancient Greek translators chose μελετᾶν—“to practice, rehearse”—a word that captures both rumination and repetition. Torah here is not an occasional reading; it is a habit that lodges in the mouth and reshapes the mind.

The poem’s center is not an argument but a scene: a tree “transplanted by channels of water” (וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם, wə-hā-YĀH kə-ʿĒTS shā-THŪL ʿal-pal-ghēy-MĀ-yim). BDB notes that שָׁתוּל (shā-THŪL) is the passive participle of שָׁתַל, “to transplant.” This is horticulture, not happenstance. And פַלְגֵי־מָיִם (pal-ghēy-MĀ-yim) are divided runnels—irrigation channels. The image is agricultural realism: a tree secured by design to a reliable source, yielding fruit “in its season,” with leaves that do not wither (v. 3). Jeremiah 17:8 repeats the picture almost verbatim; Ezekiel 47:12 uses it to figure a restored world. Rashi, in a wry expansion, says even the leaves of such a tree serve a purpose; even the casual talk of scholars is worth listening to.

If the righteous are rooted, the wicked are weightless. “Not so the wicked!” (לֹא־כֵן הָרְשָׁעִים). They are “like chaff that the wind drives away” (כַּמֹּץ אֲשֶׁר־תִּדְּפֶנּוּ רוּחַ, kam-MŌTS ’ăsher-tid-FEN-nū RŪ-aḥ). The metaphor is an ancient cliché because it is a perennial truth: worthless husk blown off the threshing floor. Elsewhere the psalmists deploy it as a wish against enemies (Psalms 35:5; 83:14); Isaiah (41:2) uses it to describe empires swept away. The choice of verb—נָדַף, “to drive, scatter”—adds force. The contrast is not only moral; it is physical. A rooted organism versus a husk in a gust.

The ending tightens the argument. Verse 5 speaks in courtroom terms. The wicked “will not stand” (לֹא־יָקֻמוּ, lō’-yā-QU-mū) in the judgment; “sinners” will not enter “the assembly of the righteous” (בַּעֲדַת צַדִּיקִים). This is deliberate irony. The poem had warned us against “standing” (עָמָד, ʿā-MĀDH) in the path of sinners; now the wicked cannot stand at all—least of all where it truly matters. Malbim sharpens the distinction the poem suggests: “wicked” (רְשָׁעִים, hardened rebels) are excluded even individually; “sinners” (חַטָּאִים, those who miss) might plead weakness before God but still find no place among the righteous community.

The conclusion, “For YHWH knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish” (כִּי־יוֹדֵעַ יְהוָה דֶּרֶךְ צַדִּיקִים וְדֶרֶךְ רְשָׁעִים תֹּאבֵד), is a compact theology. In Hebrew, “to know” (יֹודֵעַ, yō-DHĒ-aʿ) often means to care for, to acknowledge with favor (cf. Psalm 144:3; Hosea 13:5). God’s knowing is not mere awareness; it is sustaining attention. Notice, too, that it is “the way” that perishes (תֹּאבֵד, tō-VĒDH), not simply the wicked themselves. The path collapses under its own weightlessness. Wisdom literature repeats this insight with relentless simplicity: there are ways of living that are, in their very structure, unsustainable (see Proverbs 4:19; Jeremiah 12:1).

A few literary features repay lingering over. Verse 1 uses anaphora (repetition at the head of phrases) to create pulse: לֹא (LŌ’) … לֹא … לֹא. Read aloud, the three negatives strike with the accentual rhythm characteristic of biblical verse (poets balance stresses rather than syllable counts). The whole psalm is framed by דֶּרֶךְ (“way”): implied in v. 1, explicit twice in v. 6—an inclusio, a bracket that signals coherence. And at the editorial level, Psalms 1 and 2 form a carefully designed gateway. Psalm 1 opens with אַשְׁרֵי (“happy”); Psalm 2 closes with the same word: אַשְׁרֵי כָּל־חֹוסֵי בוֹ (“happy are all who take refuge in Him,” 2:12). The pair sets Torah meditation (Psalm 1) alongside the tumult of history under divine rule (Psalm 2)—private habit beside public drama.

Finally, the Septuagint (LXX), the ancient Greek version, both confirms and colors our reading. It renders תּוֹרָה as νόμος (law), plants the student in the same practice (μελετᾷ ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτός), and translates “seat of scoffers” (מוֹשַׁב לֵצִים) as καθέδρα λοιμῶν, “seat of pestilent men”—a vivid choice that treats scoffing as contagious rot. The LXX’s voice is not decisive, but it is a second witness from antiquity: Psalm 1 was always heard as instruction and enacted habit, not merely inspiration.

Psalm 1, then, is not a whisper of private piety. It is a grammar for reading the book it opens and, by extension, a map for reading a life: roads you choose, words you chew, where you plant yourself, and what becomes of you.

---LITURGICAL-SECTION-START---

#### Full psalm
On Yom Kippur night, many communities recite Psalm 1 in full before Maariv as part of a threshold sequence of psalms. In Edot HaMizrach practice it often opens a chain (Psalms 1–3, 24) before the formal service. The Day of Atonement begins by placing the worshiper on Psalm 1’s forked road: “אַשְׁרֵי הָאִישׁ … כִּי אִם בְּתוֹרַת יְ־הוָה חֶפְצוֹ” (“Happy the person… but his delight is in the Torah of YHWH”), a liturgical way of saying that repentance is a return to the right path.

#### Key verses
1:3 “וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם … וְכֹל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ / He is like a tree transplanted by channels of water … and all he does prospers.”
- Tefillat Geshem (Prayer for Rain), Mussaf of Shemini Atzeret. The piyyut includes: “בֵּרַכְתּו כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל פַּלְגֵי מַיִם” (Bless him like a tree planted by streams of water), tying Psalm 1’s irrigation image to the season’s plea for rain. Theologically, the verse grounds the community’s dependence on God’s steady provision, not luck.

#### Phrases
1:1 “בַּעֲצַת רְשָׁעִים / the counsel of the wicked.”
- Simchat Torah, Hakafot (Sefard/Edot HaMizrach). A petition during the circuits prays: “וּתְזַכֵּנוּ שֶׁלֹּא נֵלֵךְ בַּעֲצַת רְשָׁעִים” (Grant us the merit not to walk in the counsel of the wicked). Jewish joy is guarded by Psalm 1’s moral vigilance: celebration without frivolity’s “seat of scoffers.”

1:3 “וְעָלֵהוּ לֹא יִבּוֹל / whose leaf does not wither.”
- Simchat Torah, Hakafot (Sefard). A string of exhortations culminates: “וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל פַּלְגֵי מַיִם … וְעָלֵהוּ לֹא יִבּוֹל,” applying the verse to the Torah-bearer: a life rooted in study and practice remains green under pressure.

In several Edot HaMizrach communities, phrases from 1:3 surface in festival Kiddush and Mussaf petitions, weaving “כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל” into the season’s hopes for blessing. Across these uses, the tradition reads Psalm 1 not as generic good advice but as liturgical realism: the righteous are cultivated, irrigated by Torah and rain; celebration is chastened by Psalm 1’s first line; and the assembly of the righteous (1:5) becomes, for a moment, the gathered congregation.

### REVISED VERSE COMMENTARY

**Verse 1**

The psalm begins with אַשְׁרֵי־הָאִישׁ (`'ash-rēy-hā-'IY-sh`), “Happy is the person.” Medievals noticed that אַשְׁרֵי (’ashrei) is plural in form; Radak glossed it as a cluster of goods, not a single stroke of luck. The opening line then sets a negative profile in three beats: “who has not walked in the counsel of the wicked, nor stood in the path of sinners, nor sat in the seat of scoffers.” The verbs—הָלַךְ (`hā-LAKH`), עָמַד (`ʿā-MĀDH`), יָשַׁב (`yā-SHĀV`)—trace moral settling: from motion (walk) to arrested presence (stand) to settled belonging (sit). The triple anaphora לֹא (LŌ’) … לֹא … לֹא gives the line its pulse; read aloud, the negatives strike like posts in a fence.

The three groups are not mere synonyms. רְשָׁעִים (`rə-shā-ʿIY-m`) are the hardened wicked; חַטָּאִים (ḥat-tā-’IY-m) are those who miss the mark; לֵצִים (lē-TSIY-m) are scoffers. BDB’s portrait of the lēṣ is sharp: proud, immune to correction, delighting in mockery (Proverbs 1:22; 9:7–8; 21:24). Torah Temimah (Avodah Zarah 18b) anchors “the seat of scoffers” in social realities: “ההולך לאיצטדינין ולכרקום… הרי זה מושב לצים” (“One who goes to the stadium or circus… that is a seat of scoffers”). The poem aims not only at private vice but at cultural habitats that make cynicism feel normal.

The line is also about paths. “Counsel… path… seat” sketches a movement from advice to habitual way to identity. In the Bible, “way” (דֶּרֶךְ, DE-rekh) is a moral itinerary: “Do not turn aside to the right or to the left” (Deuteronomy 5:29–30); “you have been quick to stray from the path” (Deuteronomy 9:16). Proverbs 4:18–19 sets the binary with Psalm 1’s starkness: “The path of the righteous is like the light of dawn… The way of the wicked is deep darkness.” Our poem begins by ruling out the wrong companions and the wrong rhythms. That negative profile is not puritanism; it is preparation for a positive delight (v. 2).

The Septuagint (LXX) renders “seat of scoffers” as καθέδρα λοιμῶν, “seat of pestilent [men],” treating scoffing as a social contagion. The translator also keeps the movement: “did not go… did not stand… did not sit.” The Greek confirms how ancient readers heard the line: not a single prohibition but a staged warning about moral gravity.

Finally, a small irony seeds the poem’s end: the righteous refuse to “stand” (עָמַד) where sin traffics; in v. 5 the wicked “will not stand” (לֹא־יָקֻמוּ) in judgment. What you refuse now, you will be refused later.

**Verse 2**

The pivot comes with an emphatic contrast: כִּי אִם (ki ’im, “but rather”). Happiness is not mere avoidance; it is attachment. “But his delight is in the Torah of YHWH, and in his Torah he meditates day and night.” The noun חֵפֶץ (`ḥef-TSŌ`) is stronger than approval; it is pleasure, desire. The phrase תּוֹרַת יְהוָה (torat YHWH, “Torah of YHWH”) shifts, with deliberate boldness, to וּבְתוֹרָתוֹ (“and in his Torah”). Rashi hears the internalization: at first it is God’s Torah; after toil, it is yours. Meiri, with philological tact, notes that had the second phrase referred to God again, we might expect “בְּדָתוֹ” (“in His law” with a parallel term). The variation is meaning-bearing.

The key verb יֶהְגֶּה (`yeh-GEH`) is wonderfully physical. BDB’s range—“moan, growl, utter, muse”—runs from sound to sense. The study envisioned is vocal: murmured recitation, not silent scanning. Joshua 1:8 commands the same daily rumination; the LXX’s μελετᾶν (“to practice”) reinforces the sense of repeated rehearsal that penetrates memory and manner. The time-phrase יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה (yō-MĀM wā-LĀ-ye-lāh, “day and night”) is a merism, naming the poles to mean “always.” Psalm 55:11 uses the same idiom for constant watch; Genesis 8:22 uses “day and night” to denote ongoing cycles. Here the phrase turns study into a habit forming a life.

Torah Temimah (Kiddushin 32a) preserves a rabbinic dialectic that circles this verse: Is the Torah “His,” or can a teacher waive the honor due because it is “his” (the teacher’s) to waive? Rava’s concluding turn cites our verse—“וּבְתוֹרָתוֹ יֶהְגֶּה”—to insist that the Torah becomes one’s own through devotion, even as it remains God’s. The paradox both democratizes and sanctifies study.

We should not miss the literary engine. Verse 1’s triple לֹא (“not… not… not”) gives way to a single desire. The poet’s craft—negative space opening to a positive center—tells a moral truth: habits of refusal make room for a persistent joy. This is not sternness; it is eros redirected to the right object.

**Verse 3**

The poem’s thesis becomes an image: “He is like a tree transplanted by channels of water.” שָׁתוּל (`shā-THŪL`) is precise: a transplant, not a volunteer. The righteous are not naturally lucky trees; they have been sited and tended. פַלְגֵי־מָיִם (`pal-ghēy-MĀ-yim`) are divided channels—the irrigation system of an intentional planter. Across the Bible such “streams” signal reliable nourishment (Psalm 46:4; Isaiah 32:2). Jeremiah 17:8 is the closest parallel: a tree unafraid in drought; Ezekiel 47:12 pictures trees whose “leaf does not wither” (לֹא יִבּוֹל, lō’ yi-BŌL), the very phrase here.

Three clauses complete the portrait: “that yields its fruit in its season” (פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ), “its leaf does not wither,” “and whatever he does prospers” (כֹּל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ). The first tempers any simplistic “prosperity gospel”: fruit “in season” implies rhythm, not constant harvest. The second speaks to endurance; Rashi famously extends it—“even its leaves are for use,” i.e., even the side-talk of sages repays listening. The third, comprehensive line is often misunderstood. Wisdom literature means by הַצְלָחָה (success) thriving within the moral order, not invulnerability to misfortune. The LXX’s καταευοδωθήσεται (he “will be prospered well”) carries the same moral shading: the path made straight, not the bank account fattened.

This verse has an ongoing liturgical life. In Tefillat Geshem (Shemini Atzeret), the community prays: “בֵּרַכְתּו כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל פַּלְגֵי מַיִם” (Bless him like a tree planted by streams of water), yoking Psalm 1’s irrigation to the season’s plea for rain. The metaphor is doing double duty: Torah is a watercourse; rain is grace; rootedness is both discipline and gift.

The figurative pattern is common but pointed. Our database shows “tree/fruit/leaf” imagery regularly marks fertility or offspring (e.g., Deuteronomy 28:4), but here the agricultural scene is moral: stability, appropriateness (“in season”), perseverance. The psalmist prefers horticultural patience to spectacle. A life close to water is slow and sure.

**Verse 4**

“Not so the wicked!” The abruptness (לֹא־כֵן, lō’-KHĒN) is a reset: everything said of rootedness does not apply. “Rather, they are like chaff that the wind drives away” (כַּמֹּץ אֲשֶׁר־תִּדְּפֶנּוּ רוּחַ, kam-MŌTS ’ăsher-tid-FEN-nū RŪ-aḥ). מֹּץ (MŌTS) is the fine husk stripped from grain on the threshing floor; BDB notes נָדַף (to “drive, scatter”) often connotes force. The metaphor recurs: “Let them be like chaff before the wind” (Psalm 35:5); “like stubble before the wind” (Psalm 83:14); Isaiah 41:2 uses the image for nations routed by a conqueror. The usage pattern is consistent: chaff equals insubstantiality and vulnerability.

It is also instructive to notice the poem’s proportions. The righteous get an extended, layered portrait (root, fruit, leaf, success). The wicked get one image, conventional and brief. The brevity is not an accident of space; it is part of the verdict. Wickedness is a negative capability—it produces waste and gets carried off. Radak adds a farmer’s note: chaff not only has no value; it stings eyes and fouls gardens when blown about. It is useless and harmful.

The LXX doubles the negation—οὐχ οὕτως οἱ ἀσεβεῖς, οὐχ οὕτως—pressing the point and making the chaff line almost a refrain. The Greek later adds “ἀπὸ προσώπου γῆς” (“from the face of the earth”), a flourish not in the Hebrew that underscores disappearance.

Theological modesty is in order. Verse 4 does not claim the wicked always present as losers; Psalm 73 knows they often prosper. It claims, rather, that their way “will not stand” (cf. v. 5). The image is a judgment of quality, not a snapshot of circumstances: a husk cannot carry weight.

**Verse 5**

“Therefore” (עַל־כֵּן, ʿal-KĒN) shifts from metaphor to consequence. “The wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.” The verb יָקֻמוּ (`yā-QU-mū`) here is forensic: to stand one’s ground in court, to endure scrutiny. The irony with v. 1 ripens: the blessed refused to “stand in the path of sinners”; now those very sinners cannot stand when it counts. The structure makes the moral point memorable.

Two spheres appear: individual judgment (בַּמִּשְׁפָּט, bam-mish-PĀT) and communal belonging (בַּעֲדַת צַדִּיקִים, ba-ʿa-DHATH tsa-diy-QIY-m). The “assembly” (עֵדָה) is not a chance crowd; BDB notes it is an appointed congregation. Malbim’s gloss is subtle and helpful: “wicked” (רשעים) fail even when judged alone; “sinners” (חטאים), who err by appetite and weakness, might find some extenuation before God but still cannot be included in the refined measure of the righteous community. Ibn Ezra offers a more existential reading of “judgment” as “the day of death”—the decisive divine reckoning when the question of belonging is settled.

The LXX flattens the two spheres slightly by repeating its favorite word: “οὐδὲ ἁμαρτωλοὶ ἐν βουλῇ δικαίων,” “nor sinners in the council of the righteous,” echoing v. 1’s βουλή. Even so, the sense remains: no seat in that company.

Liturgically, the line’s “assembly of the righteous” invites the congregation to see itself, for a moment, as that body—if only aspirationally. But the psalm also cautions against presumption. The “assembly” in view is God’s, not ours to police; the boundary runs through a life before it runs between people.

**Verse 6**

“For YHWH knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.” The causal כִּי (ki) grounds all that precedes in God’s regard. As Radak explains, “to know” (יֹודֵעַ, `yō-DHĒ-aʿ`) here is “to recognize and attend in order to do good.” The verb has covenantal warmth: “I knew you in the wilderness” (Hosea 13:5). Ibn Ezra, thinking about divine knowledge philosophically, insists God knows both universals and particulars; he then reads our verse ontologically: the righteous way adheres to what lasts and so “stands” in divine knowledge; the wicked way adheres to what cannot last and so “perishes.” The psalm’s last word, תֹּאבֵד (`tō-VĒDH`), carries the weight of many biblical uses: to vanish, fail, be destroyed (cf. Psalm 37:20; 73:27).

Formally, the verse is perfect antithetic parallelism: A (God’s knowing) versus B (the perishing of the other way). The inclusio is complete: we began with “counsel/path/seat” and end with “way… way,” the road motif bracketing the whole. The psalm’s argument is deliberately unoriginal; it repeats Moses and Proverbs. “Follow only the path that YHWH has enjoined upon you, so that you may thrive” (Deuteronomy 5:30). “There is a way that seems right… but its end is the way to death” (Proverbs 14:12). Psalm 1’s gift is tone and image: it makes the choice visible and habitual—a tree and chaff; a voice murmuring Torah; a God who knows.

There is also an editorial grace note: with this “אַשְׁרֵי” at the start and the “אַשְׁרֵי” at Psalm 2:12, the canonical editors bound private devotion to public tumult. The one who delights in Torah (Psalm 1) is the same one who takes refuge in the God who laughs at raging nations (Psalm 2). Between those two “happys,” a reader learns how to stand.
