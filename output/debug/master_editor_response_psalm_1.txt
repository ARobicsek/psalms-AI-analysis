### EDITORIAL ASSESSMENT

What works: The draft rightly treats Psalm 1 as the Psalter’s threshold—framing the “two ways,” highlighting the pivot from refusal (v. 1) to delight (v. 2), and drawing out the asymmetry of v. 6 (God “knows” the righteous way; the wicked way “perishes”). The notes on חֵפֶץ (delight) and הָגָה (to murmur/meditate), and on שָׁתוּל (transplanted) and פַלְגֵי־מַיִם (irrigation channels), are solid. The draft also nods toward liturgical use.

What needs work: 
- It leans on generalities where the text rewards close reading. The rhetorical mechanics—parallelism, anaphora (repetition at a line’s opening), and the poem’s internal echoes (“stand” in vv. 1 and 5)—should be made explicit. 
- The LXX (ancient Greek translation) is left unused; its choices (“μελετήσει,” meditate/study; “λοιμῶν,” pestilent persons) sharpen interpretation. 
- Figurative language is under-illustrated by specific biblical parallels; Psalm 1’s chaff and tree are standard images with a history (e.g., Ps 35:5; Job 21:18; Isa 17:13; Jer 17:8) that should be mobilized to show what is distinctive here.
- Rabbinic reception (Avodah Zarah 19; Sanhedrin 107b) and liturgical usage are mentioned but not integrated as interpretation—how tradition reads Psalm 1 should be shown to illuminate the psalm itself.
- Occasional phonetic asides feel gratuitous. Use sound only where it illuminates craft (e.g., the triple לֹא, “not,” in v. 1).
- Some missed opportunities: the legal idiom “stand in judgment” (v. 5) resonates with Deut 19:15 (“a matter shall stand”), and Joshua 1:8 tightly links Torah recitation to “prospering,” echoing v. 3.

Figurative language assessment: The draft does not systematically cite parallels. It should: 
- Tree by water: Jer 17:8; Ps 92:13-15.
- Chaff: Ps 35:5; Job 21:18; Isa 17:13.
- “Walk in God’s ways”: Deut 8:6; 10:12.
Doing so will let us ask: how does Psalm 1’s planting-as-transplant (שָׁתוּל) and cultivation (פלגי) nuance a well-worn image? Why is chaff so tersely sketched here? And what do these choices signal about the psalm’s confident, programmatic tone?

In sum: deepen the literary analysis, bring in the LXX and specific cross-references, integrate rabbinic and liturgical reception as interpretation, and refine the style—lucid, precise, unlabored.

### REVISED INTRODUCTION

Psalm 1 is less a preface than a threshold. Cross it, and you have already been taught how to read the songs that follow. The psalm sketches two paths in six verses—the righteous, whose life is rooted in Torah, and the wicked, who are as weightless as chaff—then leaves the reader with a sentence that feels like a judicial verdict (v. 6). The poet’s art is laconic and exacting. It is not a lecture in ethics, but a poem that instructs by form as much as by statement.

The opening beatitude, אַשְׁרֵי הָאִישׁ (“Happy” or “How fortunate the person”), is plural in Hebrew—literally, “felicities.” Medievals noticed the plural (Radak: “one does not call a person happy for a single good, but for many”), and the point stands: Psalm 1 is not about flashes of luck but a durable state. That durability is defined at first by refusal. Verse 1 builds by anaphora (repetition at a line’s start) and by a “staircase” of verbs: “has not walked … nor stood … nor sat.” The negatives—לֹא … לֹא … לֹא—strike like fence posts. The company likewise escalates: “the wicked … sinners … scoffers.” Ancient Jewish readers already heard in this a compressed moral psychology: casual contact hardens into stance, stance into seat. Ibn Ezra contrasts the terms: “wicked” are morally unstable, “sinners” are those who commit the deed, “scoffers” corrode the moral world with mockery. The Greek translators rendered the last term as “λοιμῶν”—pestilent persons; scorn is a social disease.

The turn in verse 2 is the hinge of the psalm: “but rather, in the Torah of YHWH is his delight, and in his Torah he meditates day and night.” The noun חֵפֶץ is desire, not mere duty; it can be erotic (cf. Gen 34:19). The verb הָגָה, as the standard lexica note, means “to mutter, murmur”—the sound of text on the lips. That is how ancient reading worked; it is also how Torah penetrates the self. The second colon’s possessive (“in his Torah”) prompted a rabbinic insight (Avodah Zarah 19a): “At first it is called ‘Torah of YHWH’; after one has labored in it, it is called ‘his Torah.’” The psalm hints at this interiorization by its own syntax.

The tree image that follows is not generic pastoral. The righteous is “like a tree שָׁתוּל (transplanted) by channels of water” (פַלְגֵי־מַיִם). The choice of שָׁתוּל matters: this is not random sprouting, but intentional placement in an optimal site—exactly the work of the cultivator. The “channels” are irrigation runs, not a wild river. In other words, the psalm makes flourishing a consequence of practices: the discipline of Torah recitation shapes a life the way a careful farmer shapes a plot. Elsewhere biblical poets use related imagery (Jer 17:8: “like a tree planted by water”; Ps 92:13-15: trees thriving in God’s courts), but here the agricultural specificity is striking. This is not a cosmic tree; this is an orchard.

The contrast is as spare as the tree is lush: “Not so the wicked—like chaff that the wind drives away” (v. 4). Chaff (מֹץ) is the light debris of threshing, the non-food, the flotsam. The image is a stock one for judgment (Ps 35:5; Job 21:18; Isa 17:13), but the poet’s brevity is an argument: evil is insubstantial; it does not merit narrative. Readers sometimes ask whether “wind” (רוּחַ) might carry a hint of the divine Spirit; perhaps—but the point is not the force but the weightlessness of what it scatters.

Verses 5–6 move from farm to court. “Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous” (v. 5). “Stand” is a legal idiom: to “stand” is to be upheld, to be established (cf. Deut 19:15, “a matter shall stand” = be valid). The line also quietly echoes v. 1: the person who did not “stand” in the path of sinners will “stand” when it matters; the wicked, who did stand in that path, will not. The phrase “assembly of the righteous” (בַּעֲדַת צַדִּיקִים) borrows the Torah’s word for Israel’s gathered community (עֵדָה), and the Greek (“βουλῇ δικαίων,” counsel of the righteous) intentionally circles back to v. 1’s “counsel of the wicked,” closing the poem’s frame.

The finale, verse 6, is wonderfully asymmetrical: “For YHWH knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked shall perish.” “Knows” in biblical Hebrew is covenantal—God’s attentive, electing recognition (Gen 18:19: “I have known/acknowledged Abraham”; Amos 3:2: “You only have I known”). Evil, by contrast, needs no agent; it collapses of its own contradictions. The poem therefore avoids a naïve calculus of reward-and-punishment; its claim is about reality’s structure. To delight in Torah is to be placed—transplanted—next to sources that make life fruitful “in its season.” To dismiss the moral order is to become, eventually, something the wind does not need to fight to remove.

This opening psalm also sets up tensions the Psalter will explore. “Whatever he does prospers” (v. 3) is true enough to orient the prayer book; it is not always true this afternoon. The laments and pleas that follow treat Psalm 1 less as guarantee than as north star. It remains the Psalter’s quiet, programmatic audacity: let this be your habit—mouth and mind set to Torah, sustained over days and nights—and see what sort of life it grows.

—Definitions: 
- Parallelism: a line’s second half answers or intensifies the first (“A is so, and what’s more, B”). 
- Anaphora: the repetition of a word at successive line openings (here, לֹא).
- Merism: naming two poles to imply the whole (e.g., “day and night” = all the time).
- Colon: a single poetic line within a couplet.

---LITURGICAL-SECTION-START---

#### Full psalm

In both Ashkenazi and Edot HaMizrach rites, many communities recite Psalm 1 at the outset of Yom Kippur night (Maariv), often as part of a chain (Pss 1–4; in some Edot HaMizrach traditions, followed by Ps 24 and a יהי רצון). Beginning the Day of Atonement with “אַשְׁרֵי הָאִישׁ” (Happy the one) frames the fast with Psalm 1’s “two ways” and its call to Torah-formed desire: “כִּי אִם בְּתוֹרַת ה׳ חֶפְצוֹ… יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה.”

#### Key verses

Psalm 1:3 — “וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם… וְכֹל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ / He is like a tree transplanted by channels of water… all he does prospers.” In the Rosh Hashanah night Kiddush (Edot HaMizrach), poetic introductions quote the verse verbatim: “וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי מַיִם… וְכָל אֲשֶׁר יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ,” turning the psalm’s horticultural promise into a communal benediction for the year.

#### Phrases

- Psalm 1:1a — “בַּעֲצַת רְשָׁעִים / in the counsel of the wicked.” In Simḥat Torah hakafot (Sephardi), a petition reads: “וּתְזַכֵּנוּ שֶׁלֹּא נֵלֵךְ בַּעֲצַת רְשָׁעִים,” making Psalm 1’s negative template an ethical guardrail during the Torah’s festive circuit.

- Psalm 1:3a — “כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם / like a tree transplanted by streams of water.” In Tefillat Geshem (Shemini Atzeret), the piyyut recalls the patriarchs and prays for rain: “בֵּרַכְתּוֹ כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל פַּלְגֵי מַיִם,” yoking Psalm 1’s irrigation image to Israel’s agricultural dependence and divine provision.

- Psalm 1:1c — “וּבְמוֹשַׁב לֵצִים לֹא יָשָׁב / in the seat of scoffers he did not sit.” In the Pirkei Avot study rubric (as printed in many siddurim), gatherings without words of Torah are labeled “מוֹשַׁב לֵצִים… שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: וּבְמוֹשַׁב לֵצִים לֹא יָשָׁב,” while Torah-centered fellowship is said to host the Shekhinah. In some versions, Psalm 1:3 buttresses a teaching on moral steadfastness: “כָּל הָרוּחוֹת… אֵין מְזִיזִין אוֹתוֹ… שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל…”

Liturgical use confirms how Jewish tradition has read the psalm: as a rule for life (“Do not walk… stand… sit”), a pedagogy of desire (Torah murmured “day and night”), and a blessing prayed over the community’s seasons.

### REVISED VERSE COMMENTARY

**Verse 1**

The psalm begins with a beatitude formula, אַשְׁרֵי הָאִישׁ—literally “the felicities of the man.” Radak already noted the plural: happiness here is composite and durable, not a momentary windfall. The verse proceeds by anaphora (threefold לֹא, “not”) and by a “staircase” of posture-verbs that suggest deepening entanglement: “has not walked … nor stood … nor sat.” The three social locations likewise intensify: “counsel of the wicked … path of sinners … seat of scoffers.”

Each phrase deserves a moment. “Walking,” “standing,” and “sitting” are common Hebrew metaphors for a way of life, a stance, an identification. “Walk in God’s ways” (Deut 8:6; 10:12) names a whole moral manner; conversely, “to walk after” idols (Deut 4:3) means allegiance. To “stand” is to pause and consider—or to be established; its legal sense will return in v. 5. To “sit” signals settled belonging: מוֹשָׁב (moshav) is “seat/assembly,” the company one keeps (cf. Ps 107:32). Thus, the poem gives us a miniature narrative of moral capture: what begins as a flirtation with bad advice becomes a stance in a compromised path and ends as a chair with one’s name on it.

The three groups also move from broad to corrosive. רְשָׁעִים (wicked) are those whose life is out of joint with justice; חַטָּאִים (sinners) commit the deed; לֵצִים (scoffers) undermine by mockery. Rabbinic tradition intuited that final stage: scorn hollows out the moral world by turning seriousness into a joke. The Septuagint’s choice—“καθέδραν λοιμῶν” (seat of pestilent men)—casts scorn as socially contagious.

The craft is audible. Read aloud, the initial negatives—לֹא … לֹא … לֹא—form a rhythm of refusal (anaphora: repeated openings). The triad of prepositions sharpens the progression: “in counsel … in the way … in the seat.” The form of the verse enacts the content: this is how compromise accretes.

Finally, note how terms introduced here will be answered later. “Counsel” (עֵצָה) returns in the LXX’s rendering of v. 5 (“βουλῇ δικαίων,” the counsel of the righteous), and “standing” will flip from a posture one avoids (v. 1) to a posture the wicked cannot sustain “in the judgment” (v. 5). The lines interlock with a craftsman’s economy.

Hebrew and English evidence:
- “בַּעֲצַת רְשָׁעִים… וּבְדֶרֶךְ חַטָּאִים… וּבְמוֹשַׁב לֵצִים” — the triple “in” that maps counsel, way, seat.
- Deut 8:6: “לָלֶכֶת בְּדְרָכָיו / to walk in His ways.”

Technical terms:
- Anaphora: repetition of a word at the head of successive cola (singular: colon, one poetic line within a pair).
- Staircase parallelism: repetition + addition that builds a sequence.

**Verse 2**

The hinge is the adversative “כִּי אִם” (“but rather”). Against the three refusals stands a single delight: “בְּתוֹרַת יְ־הוָה חֶפְצוֹ / in the Torah of YHWH is his desire.” חֵפֶץ is not dutiful assent; it is want. Elsewhere it names a lover’s longing or God’s pleasure (Hos 6:6; Isa 62:4). The righteous person is not a stoic; the psalm dares to claim that desire itself can be trained.

“And in his Torah he meditates day and night.” The verb הָגָה means to murmur, mutter—audible, embodied reading. The Septuagint’s μελετήσει (“he will study/meditate”) captures deliberate practice. The merism “day and night” means “continually,” but here it also answers the seasonality of v. 3’s fruit—time-bound human action undergirded by a timeless rhythm of recitation.

A famous rabbinic gloss (Avodah Zarah 19a) catches the syntax’s suggestive turn: “At first it is called ‘the Torah of YHWH’; after he has labored in it, it is called ‘his Torah.’” That is not privatization but internalization. The line moves from source (divine instruction) to habitus (Torah resident in the self).

Two concordances sharpen the point. First, Joshua 1:8: “This book of the Torah shall not depart from your mouth, and you shall meditate (וְהָגִיתָ) in it day and night… for then you will prosper (תַצְלִיחַ).” Psalm 1 borrows both practice and promise, and will repeat צלח (“prosper,” v. 3). Second, the poem’s choice of colon structure—the second colon completes the first—is a textbook instance of parallelism that moves thought forward (“A is so, and what’s more, B”). Affection (delight) begets action (meditation), which begets formation (the tree to come).

Tradition has embedded these lines in liturgy precisely to push practice. The Pirkei Avot rubric in many siddurim contrasts “a seat of scoffers” with fellowship in Torah; the point is not merely abstinence from mockery but a replacement of wasted speech with murmured wisdom.

Technical terms:
- Merism: “day and night” = all the time.
- Parallelism: the second colon completes the first (synthetic/climactic).

**Verse 3**

“Like a tree שָׁתוּל (transplanted) by פַלְגֵי־מָיִם (channels of water).” The precision matters. שָׁתוּל, not simply “planted” (נָטַע), suggests deliberate relocation. פַלְגֵי are divided runs—irrigation—rather than a single stream. The image is cultivation more than scenery: Torah practice has moved this life to a place where sustenance flows.

Three promises follow: “which yields its fruit in season,” “whose leaf does not wither,” and the generalization, “all he does prospers.” The timing (“in its season”) rebukes fantasies of constant harvest; the unfading foliage claims resilience even between harvests. The psalm uses a relatively rare verb for withering (נָבֵל, cf. Isa 40:7–8), heightening the sense of durability.

Biblical echoes help us hear the registers. Jeremiah 17:8 offers a cousin image: “like a tree planted by water… it does not fear when heat comes.” Psalm 92:13–15 pictures the righteous as trees “planted in the house of YHWH.” Psalm 1 stays strictly agrarian, even technical, as if to insist that moral life is agronomy: irrigation, transplanting, patiently waiting for proper yield. The Greek likewise emphasizes λογισμὸς and habit (μελετήσει) rather than ecstasy.

The verb צָלַח (“prosper”) links back to Joshua 1:8: meditation leads to prosperity; not a blank check, but the thriving of a well-placed life. That link guards against a flattened retribution theology. Psalm 1’s “prospering” is horticultural, not casino: a fruiting-in-season, a not-wilting-out-of-season, underwritten by steady water.

Rabbinic tradition loved this verse. Rashi’s wry aside—“even the leaves, the lesser parts, are useful; the conversations of scholars require study”—treats “leaf” as an allegory for the seemingly marginal byproducts of Torah life. In festival liturgy (Rosh Hashanah Kiddush; Tefillat Geshem), the verse becomes petition: “Bless us like a tree planted by streams of water,” transposing personal formation into communal hope for rain and a good year.

Parallels:
- Jer 17:8; Ps 92:13–15 (planting imagery).
- Josh 1:8 (הגה + צלח).
- The figurative database’s pattern—“transplanted/irrigated” as divine cultivation—fits Psalm 1 precisely: flourishing is achieved through placement and practice.

**Verse 4**

“Not so the wicked.” The negation is the pivot; what follows is intentionally meager. “Like chaff that the wind drives away.” Chaff (מֹץ) is agricultural waste—the light husks threshed from grain. The image is proverbial in judgment texts (Ps 35:5; Job 21:18; Isa 17:13); its force lies not in novelty but in fitness: chaff is what you do not describe. The tree merited three clauses; the wicked get eight words.

The Hebrew verb תִּדְּפֶנּוּ (“drives it away”) suggests forceful scattering, the violence of winnowing winds on a threshing floor. Whether one hears רוּחַ as “wind” or hints of “Spirit,” the effect is the same: the object is too insubstantial to remain. Ibn Ezra’s neat contrast makes the point vivid: the righteous are like grain that “stands”; the wicked like straw “before the wind.”

Here, brevity is rhetoric. By withholding elaboration, the poet refuses the wicked the dignity of detailed portraiture. Their end is not a complex fate but a dispersal, a non-legacy. The “economy of attention” is moral instruction: attend to roots and channels; do not attend to chaff.

Liturgical and rabbinic reception turned this into a pedagogy. Avodah Zarah 19b uses v. 4 to warn teachers and learners whose studies fail to bear timely fruit: without the discipline of “in its season” (v. 3), Torah engagement can degenerate into something that blows away. The point is not scolding but craft: sowing, watering, and timing are part of wisdom.

Parallels and usage pattern:
- Ps 35:5; Job 21:18; Isa 17:13: chaff in contexts of divine judgment and the ephemerality of the wicked. Psalm 1’s distinctive stamp is the stark asymmetry with v. 3: lush cultivation versus weightless refuse.

**Verse 5**

“Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.” The “therefore” draws an inference from the threshing floor to the courthouse. To “stand in the judgment” (לֹא־יָקֻמוּ בַּמִּשְׁפָּט) is to be upheld, to endure scrutiny. The idiom is legal: compare Deut 19:15’s “יָקוּם דָּבָר / a matter shall stand,” meaning “be established.” Psalm 1 plays an elegant internal counterpoint: the blessed person did not “stand” (לֹא עָמָד) in the sinners’ path (v. 1); the wicked cannot “stand” in court.

The second colon shifts from forensic scene to social belonging: “nor sinners in the assembly (עֵדָה) of the righteous.” עֵדָה is the Pentateuch’s technical term for Israel’s gathered community; here it functions as an eschatological membership test. The Septuagint’s nuance, “ἐν βουλῇ δικαίων / in the counsel of the righteous,” sends an echo back to v. 1’s “counsel of the wicked,” closing an inclusio (envelope): what counsel shaped your life determines the counsel you join.

Rabbinic exegesis teased out this line’s severity and its limits (Sanhedrin 107b): do the utterly wicked “stand” in any judgment? Opinions differ; the midrashic debate itself shows that Psalm 1’s crisp antitheses provoked careful qualification without being blunted. The line remains a moral grammar rather than a disposal policy: wrong company dissolves one’s capacity to “stand” when examined; right company forms an “assembly” that holds.

Liturgically, the verse’s “judgment” reverberates on Yom Kippur night, when communities place Psalm 1 at the doorway of the fast. The placement is interpretive: the psalm’s legal images are not abstract—they are the community’s immediate concern.

Technical note:
- Inclusio: v. 1’s “counsel/path/seat” is answered by v. 5’s “judgment/assembly,” with the LXX’s “counsel of the righteous” completing the frame.

**Verse 6**

“For YHWH knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked shall perish.” The poem’s foundation is this asymmetry of agency. “Knows” (יודע) in Hebrew is not mere information but recognition, care, elective attention: “I have known (יְדַעְתִּיו) Abraham” (Gen 18:19); “You only have I known (יָדַעְתִּי) of all the families of the earth” (Amos 3:2). God’s knowing sustains a way; it does not make the righteous immune to trouble, but it does mean their path is under the gaze that confers reality. Conversely, the wicked way “perishes” (תֹּאבֵד) without a subject; it disintegrates. Evil is not so much hunted down as left to implode.

The noun “way” (דֶּרֶךְ) closes an inclusio with v. 1’s “path of sinners.” The poem has been about paths all along, not isolated deeds: advice taken, companions chosen, rhythms practiced, channels cut. The end of a way is in the way. That is the psalm’s large claim.

The LXX is faithful here: “ὅτι γινώσκει Κύριος ὁδὸν δικαίων, καὶ ὁδὸς ἀσεβῶν ἀπολεῖται.” “Knows” (γινώσκει) and “perishes” (ἀπολεῖται) preserve the asymmetry. The last word—“perishes”—lands like a quiet gavel.

A final observation completes the poem’s artistry. The psalm moves from what one refuses (v. 1) to what one loves (v. 2), from inner practice to outer image (v. 3), from negative contrast (v. 4) to public consequence (v. 5), and ends with God’s verdict (v. 6). The structure is catechetical. But it is also compassionate: it invites the reader to adopt habits (murmured Torah “day and night”) that, over time, transplant a life to a place where fruit is more likely to come “in season.” That is not naïveté; it is moral agronomy.

Parallels:
- Gen 18:19; Amos 3:2 (divine “knowing” as covenantal regard).
- The psalm’s own inclusio (דֶּרֶךְ at beginning and end) frames the whole as a lesson in path-making.

Definitions reviewed:
- Inclusio: bracketing a unit with repeated terms (“way/path”).
- Asymmetry of agency: God actively “knows” the righteous way; the wicked way passively “perishes.” This sharpens the poem’s theology without slipping into mechanistic retribution.

In the end, Psalm 1 is less naïve promise than invitation: build your days around the murmured text; let yourself be transplanted; attend to the channels. The rest of the Psalter will test and deepen that counsel. The first psalm plants it.
