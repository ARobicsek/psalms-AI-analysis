### EDITORIAL ASSESSMENT

What works: The draft introduction perceptively links Psalm 10 to Psalm 9 as a broken acrostic and rightly frames the poem as a sustained meditation on divine hiddenness countered by liturgical assertion. It tracks the psalm’s psychological center with the three “he says in his heart” speeches and notices the verb darash (“seek/call to account”) as a structural hinge. The commentary is rich, generally accurate, and attentive to diction, idiom, and rhetoric. It often integrates medieval Jewish exegesis and occasionally notes liturgical reception.

What needs revision: 
- Parallels and liturgical uses are frequently cited without quotations. Sophisticated readers want to see the Hebrew. We should quote biblical parallels (e.g., Ps 9–10, 13:2; 94:9; Deut 31:17) and prayer citations (Yehi Kevod; High Holiday piyyutim; Selichot; Seder HaAvodah).
- A few grammatical matters need tightening (e.g., the syntax of אין אֱלֹהִים כׇּל־מְזִמּוֹתָיו; the jussive force in v. 2; the perfect in v. 14 as a rhetorical “perfect of conviction”). Define technical terms (acrostic, colon, jussive, perfect/perfective, prophetic perfect) in-line.
- Some LXX material in the provided “Psalm Text” appears misaligned; avoid relying on those lines. It is safe—and important—to note that the LXX merges Psalms 9–10.
- Missed opportunities: the Torah Temimah’s halakhic/agadic uses (Bava Kamma 94a; Megillah 17b) deserve quotation. Figurative language parallels (lion, net, hidden face) should be demonstrated with at least one Hebrew/English example apiece. Related psalms (31, 44, 74, 94) can be used to sharpen the psalm’s argument through brief, quoted cross-references.
- The liturgical section needs restructuring: specific headings, Hebrew citations from the prayers, and explanation of how the liturgy repurposes the verses.

Action plan:
- Revise the introduction to define terms, anchor claims with quotations, and answer obvious questions (e.g., why “nations” in v. 16, what “prophetic perfect” accomplishes, the semantics of darash).
- Rework verse notes to begin with punctuated Hebrew, add parallel quotations, integrate rabbinic and liturgical reception (with Hebrew), and clarify syntax where needed.
- Build the liturgical section with proper subheadings, Hebrew excerpts, and brief theological reflection on reception.

Figurative language: The current draft often cites patterns without quoting. The revision will show them (e.g., Ps 64:5; 9:16; 13:2; 94:9) and compare Psalm 10’s distinctive use.

### REVISED INTRODUCTION

Psalm 10 stands with Psalm 9 in ancient tradition. The Septuagint (the early Greek translation of the Bible) merges them as one poem, and the acrostic begun in Psalm 9 continues across Psalm 10, though with gaps. One conspicuous lacuna is the missing ayin stanza—striking in a poem about the עָנִי, the afflicted—suggesting that even the “alphabet” of order is broken. That formal fracture enacts the theme: the world’s moral sequence feels interrupted; God’s justice seems to skip a line.

The psalm opens with two direct questions: “לָמָה יְהוָה תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָחוֹק; תַּעְלִים לְעִתּוֹת בַּצָּרָה” (“Why, LORD, do you stand far off; why do you hide in times of trouble?” v. 1). The verbs map theology onto space: God “stands” at a distance; He “hides.” The phrase “hide your face” is a biblical idiom for withdrawing favor or presence: “וְהִסְתַּרְתִּי פָנַי מֵהֶם” (“I will hide my face from them,” Deut 31:17). Psalm 10’s opening protests that this withdrawal arrives “in times of trouble,” the very moment when divine sight and nearness are most needed. Theologically, the psalm lives in that dissonance.

What makes Psalm 10 singular is its psychological portrait of the oppressor. Three times we are allowed to overhear what “he says in his heart” (אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ)—that is, what he truly thinks, not what he would say publicly. First: “בַּל־אֶמּוֹט” (“I shall not be moved,” v. 6); then: “שָׁכַח אֵל; הִסְתִּיר פָּנָיו; בַּל־רָאָה לָנֶצַח” (“God has forgotten; He has hidden His face; He will never see,” v. 11); finally: “לֹא תִדְרֹשׁ” (“You do not call to account,” v. 13). The wicked reaches the same empirical conclusion the sufferer fears—God appears hidden—but draws the opposite inference: permission. Where the psalmist petitions, the wicked plunders.

A single verb binds the psalm’s debate: דָּרַשׁ (darash). It can mean to seek, inquire, investigate, or require in the sense of “calling to account.” The wicked, according to v. 4, “does not seek” (בַּל־יִדְרֹשׁ)—either he refuses to seek God, or he presumes God will not seek him. In v. 13 he makes the presumption explicit: “לֹא תִדְרֹשׁ.” But v. 15 turns the verb like a key: “תִּדְרוֹשׁ־רִשְׁעוֹ” (“seek out his wickedness”)—and do so “בַּל־תִּמְצָא,” “until you find none [left].” Elsewhere the Psalter can call God “דֹּרֵשׁ דָּמִים” (“the One who requires blood,” Ps 9:13), and the Torah applies the verb to vows that God will “surely require” (דָּרֹשׁ יִדְרְשֶׁנּוּ, Deut 23:22). Psalm 10 speaks in that register: a demand for divine investigation and requital.

The poem’s middle is a gallery of predation. “He sits in ambush of villages; in secret places he kills the innocent; his eyes watch the helpless” (יֵשֵׁב בְּמַאְרַב חֲצֵרִים; בַּמִּסְתָּרִים יַהֲרֹג נָקִי; עֵינָיו לְחֵלְכָה יִצְפֹּנוּ, v. 8). The language of ambush recurs in the Psalter as a metaphor for hidden attacks (cf. Ps 64:5: “לִירוֹת בַּמִּסְתָּרִים תָּם; פִּתְאֹם יוֹרֻהוּ,” “to shoot in secret at the blameless; suddenly they shoot”). Here, the image doubles: the wicked is a lion—“כְּאַרְיֵה בְּסֻכּוֹ”—and a net-hunter: “יַחְטֹף עָנִי בְּמֹשְׁכוֹ בְּרִשְׁתּוֹ” (v. 9). The metaphors need not be consistent; their stacking is the point. This is violence by patience (ambush), by brute force (lion), and by craft (nets). Psalm 9 had already sketched the justice the psalmist longs for: “בְּרֶשֶׁת־זוּ טָמְנוּ נִלְכְּדָה רַגְלָם” (“In the net they hid, their foot was caught,” Ps 9:16). Psalm 10 asks why that reversal is not happening now.

Between complaint and petition stands one of the Bible’s starkest interior confessions: “He says in his heart, ‘God has forgotten; He has hidden his face; He will never see’” (v. 11). Psalm 13 gives that cry to the righteous: “עַד־אָנָה תַסְתִּיר אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ מִמֶּנִּי” (“How long will you hide your face from me?” Ps 13:2). Psalm 94 taunts those who suppose a blind God: “הֲנֹטַע אֹזֶן, הֲלֹא יִשְׁמָע; אִם־יוֹצֵר עַיִן, הֲלֹא יַבִּיט” (“He who planted the ear, shall He not hear? He who formed the eye, shall He not behold?” Ps 94:9). Psalm 10 gathers all those texts into one polemic: if God truly “does not see,” there is no moral universe.

The turning point is v. 14, where the psalmist answers the wicked’s creed with a sentence that begins, emphatically, with the verb: “רָאִיתָה” (“You have seen” or “You do see”). Grammarians call this use of the perfect tense a rhetorical perfect: a past form used to assert a reality so firm it may be spoken as accomplished fact. It is the psalm’s wager: to pray is already to refuse the wicked’s atheism. The line continues, “כִּי אַתָּה עָמָל וָכַעַס תַּבִּיט, לָתֵת בְּיָדֶךָ” (“for You look upon mischief and vexation, to take it into Your hand”). “To take in hand” means not to permit but to assume control. The helpless, the rare and likely archaic חֵלְכָה, “entrusts” himself to God (עָלֶיךָ יַעֲזֹב חֵלְכָה); and God has been “עוֹזֵר יָתוֹם,” “the orphan’s helper” (v. 14), a phrase that reaches back to the Torah’s covenant identity: “עֹשֶׂה מִשְׁפַּט יָתוֹם וְאַלְמָנָה” (“He executes justice for the orphan and the widow,” Deut 10:18).

Then comes the imperative the poem has prepared: “שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רָשָׁע” (“Break the arm of the wicked,” v. 15). The “arm” is a biblical emblem of power; to break it is to disarm a regime (cf. “נִשְׁבְּרָה זְרוֹעַ מוֹאָב,” “The arm of Moab is broken,” Jer 48:25). The line does not ask for private revenge; it asks for public dismantling of the machinery of harm. The Talmud cites this verse in connection with the structure of the weekday Amidah’s ninth blessing, directed against systemic evildoers (Megillah 17b), and Ashkenazi liturgy places it in Yom Kippur’s Seder HaAvodah, where the community pleads: “שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רֶשַׁע,” “Break the arm of wickedness.”

Suddenly, the psalm pivots to proclamation: “יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ עוֹלָם וָעֶד; אָבְדוּ גוֹיִם מֵאַרְצוֹ” (“The LORD is king forever and ever; nations have perished from His land,” v. 16). The past tense “אָבְדוּ” is a “prophetic perfect”—a future so certain that it is spoken as already done. Why “nations” (גוֹיִם) here? The brief answer is that the psalm peels back a layer: behind the singular “wicked” lurks a larger pattern of predatory power. Medieval exegetes already heard an eschatological chord: the oppressing powers that “perish from His land” make room for God’s manifest kingship (cf. Zech 14:9). Jewish liturgy agrees. In the Sefardic “Yehi Kevod,” this verse follows the threefold temporal acclamation—“יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ… מָלָךְ… יִמְלֹךְ”—as the capstone that assures: God’s rule annuls the boasts of empires.

The end returns to the beginning: “תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים שָׁמַעְתָּ יְהוָה; תָּכִין לִבָּם; תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ” (“The desire of the lowly you have heard, LORD; you will make their hearts firm; you will incline your ear,” v. 17). The past tense “שָׁמַעְתָּ” paired with future “תָּכִין/תַּקְשִׁיב” traces a timeline of attention: God has heard; God will strengthen; God will continue to listen. In liturgy, the prayer leader on the High Holidays borrows this language: “תָּכִין לִבָּם, תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ”—not only “hear us,” but “prepare our hearts to pray.” The poem’s purpose clause is its last line: “לִשְׁפֹּט יָתוֹם וָדָךְ; בַּל־יוֹסִיף עוֹד לַעֲרֹץ אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָרֶץ” (“to judge—vindicate—the orphan and the crushed; that mortal man of the earth will no longer terrorize,” v. 18). The verb “שָׁפַט” here is advocacy, not mere adjudication, as in Deut 10:18. The oppressor is called “אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָרֶץ,” a mortal of the earth—dust after all—opposed to “יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ עוֹלָם.” That is the psalm’s polemic summarized: mortal terror against eternal kingship.

A few terms: “acrostic” refers to a poem whose lines or stanzas begin with successive letters of the alphabet. A “colon” (plural cola) is a single line in a parallel pair. A “jussive” is a verb form expressing wish or command (“may they be caught”). “Perfect” refers to a past verb form, often used in Hebrew to assert completed or sure reality (“You have seen,” “You have heard”). A “prophetic perfect” uses that past form to state what is future as if already accomplished.

Psalm 10 is not a philosophical theodicy. It is a rhetorical one. It moves from complaint to portrait to petition to proclamation, until speech itself becomes a protest against divine absence. The alphabet of justice, as the acrostic reminds us, may be broken; but the psalm insists that its missing letters will be supplied by the One who sees and hears.

#### Key verses

יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ עוֹלָם וָעֶד; אָבְדוּ גוֹיִם מֵאַרְצוֹ (Ps 10:16). “The LORD is king forever and ever; nations have perished from His land.” In Sefardic and Mizraḥi rites this verse anchors Yehi Kevod in Pesukei DeZimra, immediately after the threefold acclamation “יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ; יְהוָה מָלָךְ; יְהוָה יִמְלֹךְ לְעוֹלָם וָעֶד.” The sequence reads: “יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ עוֹלָם וָעֶד; אָבְדוּ גוֹיִם מֵאַרְצוֹ. יְהוָה הֵפִיר עֲצַת גּוֹיִם…” It recasts Psalm 10’s plea as daily praise: God’s sovereignty appears precisely as human schemes fail.

תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים שָׁמַעְתָּ יְהוָה; תָּכִין לִבָּם; תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ (Ps 10:17). “The desire of the lowly You have heard, LORD; You will prepare their heart; You will incline Your ear.” In the High Holiday repetition of the Amidah the ḥazzan pleads: “לְחַלּוֹתְךָ שְׁלָחוּנִי מַקְהֲלוֹת הֲמוֹנֶךָ. תָּכִין לִבָּם, תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ”—“Your multitudes have sent me to supplicate before You. Prepare their hearts; incline Your ear.” The verse becomes a theology of prayer itself: God both receives and prepares prayer.

לָמָה יְהוָה תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָחוֹק; תַּעְלִים לְעִתּוֹת בַּצָּרָה (Ps 10:1). “Why, LORD, do You stand far off; hide Yourself in times of trouble?” Sefardic Selichot for 20 Sivan string this cry with others—“כִּי אַתָּה אֲדֹנָי טוֹב וְסַלָּח…” and “לָמָּה פָנֶיךָ תַסְתִּיר…”—to give communal voice to historical anguish. In the Edot HaMizrach Ne’ilah service of Yom Kippur the line is woven into a piyyut that pleads, “עֲמֹד בַּפֶּרֶץ… לָמָּה יְהוָה תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָחוֹק,” turning the psalm’s question into a last light before the gates close.

שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רָשָׁע (Ps 10:15). “Break the arm of the wicked.” In the Ashkenazi Yom Kippur Musaf, within Seder HaAvodah, a piyyut implores: “רוּמָה עֻזֶּךָ וְרוֹמֵם שְׁפָלִים; שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רֶשַׁע; תִּמְלֹךְ לְבַדְּךָ בְּקוֹרְאֵי שִׁמְךָ”—“Exalt Your might and raise the lowly; break the arm of wickedness; reign alone over those who call Your Name.” The verse is heard as communal, not personal: dismantle systems of harm so Your kingship may be manifest.

#### Phrases

תָּכִין לִבָּם (Ps 10:17). In the Yom Kippur Minḥah Selichot of Edot HaMizrach, a poet prays: “וּמְחֵה הַיּוֹם חוֹבָם… וּלְךָ תָּכִין לִבָּם, וְגַם תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ” (“Erase their debt today… and for You prepare their heart, and also cause Your ear to hear”). The psalm’s description becomes a petition: prepare our interior life so that our prayer may be heard.

תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים שָׁמַעְתָּ (Ps 10:17). In the Sefardic Simḥat Torah Hakafot, the verse is cited alongside Ps 52:10 (“וַאֲנִי כְּזַיִת רַעֲנָן…”) to celebrate divine attentiveness at the moment of Torah’s joyful circuit: praise bound to humility.

### REVISED VERSE COMMENTARY

**Verse 1**

לָמָה יְהוָה תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָחוֹק; תַּעְלִים לְעִתּוֹת בַּצָּרָה׃

The psalm begins with two interrogatives, both “לָמָה,” “why,” and sets the spatial theology that will govern the poem. God “stands” (עָמַד) “far off” and “hides” (עלם) precisely “in times of trouble.” Standing, elsewhere, can denote presence and readiness (cf. Ps 82:1, the divine “standing” in the council), but here the prepositional “בְּרָחוֹק” reverses the expectation: present but distant; observing, not intervening. The idiom “to hide the face” (הסתר פנים) is the stock biblical image for divine withdrawal (Deut 31:17; Ps 13:2: “עַד־אָנָה… תַסְתִּיר אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ מִמֶּנִּי,” “How long… will You hide Your face from me?”). The complaint is thus not atheistic but covenantal: it presumes a God who once acted and is expected to act again.

Rashi construes the line as a protest against a pattern—God’s “eyes” seemingly averted at the hour of affliction—while Ibn Ezra notes that God’s “distance” is a human perception conditioned by the absence of visible power. The verbs in Hebrew are imperfects—forms that often express ongoing or repeated action—so the question is not “Why did You…?” but “Why do You keep…?” The psalm’s drama will turn on whether that perception is true (as the wicked supposes) or intolerable (as the petition insists).

The line’s compactness—a hallmark of biblical verse—omits conjunctions and logical links, forcing the reader to infer the relationship between cola. The two parts of the line intensify each other (“A is so—and what’s more, B”): distance (“stand far”) culminates in concealment (“hide”). The psalm will later invert both: God’s “hand” is lifted (v. 12), and God “does see” (v. 14). In other words, the opening complaint sets up the poem’s rebuttal, but that rebuttal emerges not from observation but from the act of prayer itself.

Finally, note how Psalm 10 converses with its neighbors. Psalm 44, a communal lament, uses nearly identical language: “לָמָּה־פָנֶיךָ תַסְתִּיר; תִּשְׁכַּח עָנְיֵנוּ וְלַחֲצֵנוּ” (“Why do You hide Your face? Will You forget our affliction and oppression?” Ps 44:25). The same idiom can be prayed by a nation or an individual—which is precisely Psalm 10’s point: the oppressor’s success feels like systemic failure of justice.

**Verse 2**

בְּגַאֲוַת רָשָׁע יִדְלַק עָנִי; יִתָּפְשׂוּ בִּמְזִמּוֹת זוּ חָשָׁבוּ׃

The verse moves from diagnosis to imprecation. The prefixed bet in “בְּגַאֲוַת רָשָׁע” is causal (“because of/by the arrogance of the wicked”). The verb “יִדְלַק” (dālaq) literally means “burn” but idiomatically “hotly pursue” (Gen 31:36: “כִּי דָלַקְתָּ אַחֲרָי,” “that you pursued me hotly”). The object is “עָנִי,” the afflicted poor—the first of a cluster of terms for the vulnerable in this psalm (עָנִי, חֵלְכָה, נָקִי, יָתוֹם, דָּךְ). The second colon shifts into a jussive (a wish/command form): “יִתָּפְשׂוּ” (“may they be caught”) “בִּמְזִמּוֹת זוּ חָשָׁבוּ” (“in the schemes they themselves devised”). The demonstrative זוּ (“this,” an older poetic form) adds bite: “that very thing they plotted.”

The justice envisioned is measure-for-measure (middah k’neged middah). Psalm 9 says the same of national aggressors: “בְּרֶשֶׁת־זוּ טָמְנוּ נִלְכְּדָה רַגְלָם” (“In the net they hid, their own foot was caught,” Ps 9:16). Here the verb “תָּפַשׂ,” to seize, pictures the trap springing on its owner. Radak hears this as prayer: not a description of what is happening, but a plea for an alternative moral physics where the oppressor’s plan collapses inward.

The engine of predation, the verse suggests, is “גַּאֲוָה”—haughty overreach. The Psalter repeatedly links pride to harm (Ps 73:6) and to doctrinal insolence (Ps 10:4). Pride here births pursuit (“burning chase”), a verb that lifts predation out of the accidental and into the willful. The second colon—“may they be caught”—is the first counter-move in the psalm’s chess: turn calculation back on the calculator.

**Verse 3**

כִּי־הִלֵּל רָשָׁע עַל־תַּאֲוַת נַפְשׁוֹ; וּבֹצֵעַ בֵּרֵךְ; נִאֵץ יְהוָה׃

The line names three things: boasting, grasping, blasphemy. The wicked “boasts” (הִלֵּל) “about the desire of his soul”: not merely “in” his desire but “about” it, as if desire itself were a credential. The noun תַּאֲוָה is appetite as theology. The second phrase is wonderfully paradoxical: “וּבֹצֵעַ בֵּרֵךְ”—“and the one who gains by violence (‘the extortioner’) blesses.” What can this mean? Either he blesses himself or others like him, or he wraps his acquisitiveness in pious language. Either way, the next word unmasks him: “נִאֵץ יְהוָה,” “he has reviled the LORD.”

Rabbinic tradition uses this verse to stigmatize ritual piety welded to injustice. “One who stole a measure of wheat, ground it, baked it, and recited the blessing over it—this is not a blessing but a blasphemy; of him Scripture says, ‘The extortioner blessed—he reviled the LORD’” (Bava Kamma 94a: “עַל זֶה נֶאֱמַר: בּוֹצֵעַ בֵּרֵךְ נִאֵץ ה׳”). The point is not a legal technicality; it is moral clarity: religion that sanctions exploitation profanes God’s Name.

The wicked’s “blessing” is therefore the mirror image of v. 7’s “full mouth” of oaths. He can talk God-talk; the psalm listens beneath it. “תַּאֲוַת נַפְשׁוֹ,” “the desire of his throat/life,” is a strong phrasing: the “throat” is where appetite lives. Psalm 10 will soon contrast this with “תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים” (“the desire of the lowly,” v. 17), which God actually hears.

**Verse 4**

רָשָׁע כְּגֹבַהּ אַפּוֹ בַּל־יִדְרֹשׁ; אֵין אֱלֹהִים כׇּל־מְזִמּוֹתָיו׃

A compact verse that requires unpacking. The phrase “כְּגֹבַהּ אַפּוֹ” literally, “according to the height of his nose,” is a physical caricature of pride—nose lifted high. From this posture flows “בַּל־יִדְרֹשׁ,” “he does not seek.” Seek what? Two intertwined meanings: (1) he does not seek God (compare Ps 14:2, “דֹּרֵשׁ אֶת־אֱלֹהִים”); (2) he lives as if God does not “seek” him, that is, does not investigate or require his deeds.

The second colon admits two precise readings: (a) “אֵין אֱלֹהִים” is a quoted creed: “There is no God—[so say] all his schemes.” This echoes Ps 14:1: “אָמַר נָבָל בְּלִבּוֹ: אֵין אֱלֹהִים” (“The benighted says in his heart: ‘There is no God’”). Or (b) syntactically, “God is not in all his schemes”—that is, God is absent from his calculations. Ibn Ezra and Radak prefer this practical atheism: not a metaphysical denial of God’s existence but a moral one, a life planned as if God will not weigh it.

Darash returns. The wicked “does not seek” (v. 4); he asserts God “does not call to account” (v. 13); the psalmist petitions God to “seek” the wickedness till none remains (v. 15). Elsewhere, the same verb can denote the divine investigation that safeguards justice: “דֹּרֵשׁ דָּמִים” (“the One who requires blood,” Ps 9:13). Psalm 10 hangs its theology on a verb.

**Verse 5**

יָחִילוּ דְרָכָיו בְּכָל־עֵת; מָרוֹם מִשְׁפָּטֶיךָ מִנֶּגְדּוֹ; כָּל־צֹרְרָיו יָפִיחַ בָּהֶם׃

A three-step portrayal of impunity. First, “יָחִילוּ דְרָכָיו”—not “writhe” here, but “are firm/prosper,” an attested sense of the root (cf. Job 20:21: “לֹא־יָחִיל טוּבוֹ,” “his prosperity will not endure”). And “בְּכָל־עֵת”: always. Second, “Your judgments are ‘מָרוֹם’—high—‘מִנֶּגְדּוֹ’—from before him”: justice exists, but far beyond his field of view. This spatial idiom reprises v. 1’s distance; what was “You standing far” becomes “Your judgments far” for him. Third, “he ‘snorts’ at all his foes” (פוח), a verb used elsewhere for contemptuous puffing (Prov 29:8: “אַנְשֵׁי לָצוֹן יָפִיחוּ קִרְיָה,” “scoffers inflame a city”).

The effect is crushing: unbroken success, inaccessible justice, effortless disdain. The psalm does not deny the phenomenon; it dares to articulate it. But by naming it in prayer, it invites a re-framing: if “Your judgments” are high, let Your “hand” be lifted (v. 12). The poem consistently answers spatial metaphors with spatial counter-metaphors.

**Verse 6**

אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ: בַּל־אֶמּוֹט; לְדֹר וָדֹר אֲשֶׁר לֹא־בְרָע׃

The first heart-speech. “בַּל־אֶמּוֹט,” “I shall not be moved,” is a line the Psalter puts in the mouth of the righteous, too—“שִׁוִּיתִי יְהוָה לְנֶגְדִּי תָמִיד… בַּל אֶמּוֹט” (“I set the LORD always before me… I shall not be moved,” Ps 16:8). Here it is presumption, not trust. “לְדֹר וָדֹר” makes the claim generational—his security is not just present but projected across time.

The relative clause “אֲשֶׁר לֹא־בְרָע” is compressed. Likely sense: “for generation upon generation—without evil touching me,” i.e., “never in trouble.” The heart-talk here is about permanence; later it becomes about theology: God’s forgetfulness (v. 11), God’s inaction (v. 13). Malbim shrewdly notes the progression: from personal invulnerability to a theory of divine disengagement.

This formula—“he says in his heart”—is a wisdom device across Scripture (Ps 14:1; Eccl 2:15). It exposes the logic behind behavior. In Psalm 10 that logic is chillingly coherent: if I am perpetually unshaken, therefore either God forgets me (or my victims), or there is no divine reckoning.

**Verse 7**

אָלָה פִּיהוּ מָלֵא; וּמִרְמוֹת וָתֹךְ; תַּחַת לְשׁוֹנוֹ עָמָל וָאָוֶן׃

The anatomy of harm shifts to speech. The mouth is “full” (מָלֵא)—not of praise but of “oaths” (אָלָה), “deceits” (מִרְמוֹת), and “תֹּךְ” (injurious fraud). The underside of the tongue hides “עָמָל וָאָוֶן”—mischief and iniquity. The idiom “under the tongue” recurs in Job 20:12: “אִם־יַמְתִּיק בְּפִיו רָעָה; יַכְחִידֶנָּה תַּחַת לְשׁוֹנוֹ” (“If evil is sweet in his mouth, he hides it under his tongue”). The psalm’s picture is of perjury (“oaths”) as a tool of deceit—words used to do violence.

The noun pair עָמָל/אָוֶן is a favorite in the Psalter for trouble with moral emptiness. Here the balance is elegant: public noise (full mouth) vs. hidden intent (under the tongue); performative vow vs. concealed malice. The psalm will later ask God, by contrast, to “incline Your ear” (v. 17)—divine hearing against human manipulation of speech.

**Verse 8**

יֵשֵׁב בְּמַאְרַב חֲצֵרִים; בַּמִּסְתָּרִים יַהֲרֹג נָקִי; עֵינָיו לְחֵלְכָה יִצְפֹּנוּ׃

The verbs and nouns fuse to make a scene. He “sits” in “ambush” (מַאְרַב) in “חֲצֵרִים”—villages, settlements. In “secret places” (מִסְתָּרִים) he “kills the innocent” (נָקִי). His “eyes” watch (יִצְפֹּנוּ, from צָפַן “to watch/hide/store”) “לְחֵלְכָה,” the helpless—a rare word (cf. vv. 10, 14), perhaps related to “חֵלֶךְ,” weakness/poverty.

The contrast of public space (“courts/settlements”) and hiding places captures the pervasiveness of predation—no zone is safe. Psalm 64 uses similar hunting imagery—“לִירוֹת בַּמִּסְתָּרִים תָּם; פִּתְאֹם יוֹרֻהוּ” (“to shoot in secret at the blameless; suddenly they shoot,” Ps 64:5)—for slander and conspiracy. Here the result is not reputation but blood (“יַהֲרֹג נָקִי”).

Rashi notes a masoretic curiosity: the form לְחֵלְכָה with final ה may be a graphic variant for the second person suffix (“your helpless one”), creating an address to God—“Your helpless one.” Even without that, the theological point stands: the poor belong to God; His law and prophets repeatedly claim them (Deut 10:18; Isa 11:4).

**Verse 9**

יֶאֱרֹב בַּמִּסְתָּר כְּאַרְיֵה בְּסֻכּוֹ; יֶאֱרֹב לַחֲטוֹף עָנִי; יַחְטֹף עָנִי בְּמֹשְׁכוֹ בְּרִשְׁתּוֹ׃

The image resolves: a lion in its lair (“כְּאַרְיֵה בְּסֻכּוֹ”), a hunter with a net. The double “יֶאֱרֹב” (“he lurks… he lurks”) builds the tension; the third colon releases it: “יַחְטֹף,” “he seizes,” “בְּמֹשְׁכוֹ בְּרִשְׁתּוֹ,” “as he draws his net.” The mix of metaphors is deliberate. In ancient iconography, kings and predators both hunt; the psalm suggests that the oppressor imitates both: a beast in stealth, a ruler wielding technology.

Psalm 9 already pictured the just reversal: “בְּרֶשֶׁת־זוּ טָמְנוּ נִלְכְּדָה רַגְלָם” (“In the net they hid, their foot was caught,” Ps 9:16). The shift from Ps 9 (plurals; “nations”) to Ps 10 (singular; “the wicked”) is instructive: the problem is one, whether it wears a crown or a mask.

**Verse 10**

יִדְכֶּה יָשֹׁחַ; וְנָפַל בַּעֲצוּמָיו; חֵל כָּאִים׃ [Qere]

The verse is textually difficult and therefore evocative. The Qere (the traditional reading) yields “יִדְכֶּה יָשֹׁחַ”—“he crouches, he bows down”—keeping the predator subject from v. 9. Then, “וְנָפַל בַּעֲצוּמָיו”—“and there falls, by his might” (or “by his strong [ones/forces]”), “חֵל כָּאִים”—“a host of crushed ones.” The Ketiv (consonantal text) can be read differently, with “וְדָכָה”—“and is crushed”—shifting subject, and “חֵלְכָאִים” as one word.

Radak offers a different angle: sometimes the band feigns weakness (“דָכָה,” crushed) to lure travelers into complacency; then “חֵל כָּאִים”—a band of crushed-looking folk—falls on them “בַּעֲצוּמָיו,” revealing their strength. Ibn Ezra keeps the lion focus: “בַּעֲצוּמָיו” could be the lion’s powerful limbs. The ambiguity may be the point: the victim falls beneath an unspecified “might”—claws, accomplices, policy—whatever tools tyranny employs.

The verb דָּכָה (“to crush”) appears elsewhere in plaintive prayers: “לֵב נִדְכֶּה” (“a contrite heart,” Ps 51:19). Here, the “crushed” are crushed not by God’s discipline but by human force. The crescendo of verbs—crouch, bow, fall—creates a visual descent. The poem has reached the moral bottom.

**Verse 11**

אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ: שָׁכַח אֵל; הִסְתִּיר פָּנָיו; בַּל־רָאָה לָנֶצַח׃

The second heart-speech states the theology of absence in three clauses. “שָׁכַח אֵל”—“God has forgotten.” “הִסְתִּיר פָּנָיו”—“He has hidden His face.” “בַּל־רָאָה לָנֶצַח”—“He will never see.” The adverb “לָנֶצַח” could mean “forever” or “for a long time,” but the effect is a total denial of divine sight across time.

Deuteronomy 31:17 provides the covenant background: “וְחָרָה אַפִּי… וְעָזַבְתִּים, וְהִסְתַּרְתִּי פָנַי מֵהֶם… וּמְצָאֻהוּ רָעוֹת רַבּוֹת” (“My anger will flare up… I will abandon them, and hide My face from them… and many evils shall befall them”). The wicked here takes Israel’s fear (“God has hidden His face”) and uses it as a license. Psalm 94 corrects him: “הֲנֹטַע אֹזֶן, הֲלֹא יִשְׁמָע; אִם־יוֹצֵר עַיִן, הֲלֹא יַבִּיט” (“He who planted the ear, shall He not hear? He who formed the eye, shall He not behold?” Ps 94:9). Psalm 10 will answer with the same logic in v. 14: “רָאִיתָה… תַּבִּיט”—You do see.

**Verse 12**

קוּמָה יְהוָה; אֵל נְשָׂא יָדֶךָ; אַל־תִּשְׁכַּח עֲנָוִים׃

The pivot from description to petition. Three imperatives—or better, pleas: “Arise, LORD”; “O God, lift Your hand”; “Do not forget the lowly (עֲנָוִים/עֲנִיִּים).” The verb קוּמָה is a standard cry for intervention (Ps 7:7: “קוּמָה יְהוָה בְּאַפֶּךָ,” “Arise, LORD, in Your anger”), and “lift the hand” signals power displayed and action undertaken (cf. Isa 49:22). Where v. 5 lamented that “Your judgments” are “high” and far, now God’s “hand” is asked to be high and near.

The final clause answers v. 11’s “שָׁכַח אֵל” (“God has forgotten”) with “אַל־תִּשְׁכַּח” (“do not forget”). The Qere reads “עֲנָוִים,” “the lowly/humble,” a term that in the Psalter often denotes both social vulnerability and spiritual posture (cf. Ps 37:11). It is fitting that this verse has become the language of the High Holidays: “Prepare their heart; incline Your ear” (v. 17) is the next step in the liturgical chain.

**Verse 13**

עַל־מֶה נִאֵץ רָשָׁע אֱלֹהִים; אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ: לֹא תִדְרֹשׁ׃

The psalmist’s second “Why?” This time the question is directed not at God’s distance but at the wicked’s insolence: “On what basis does the wicked scorn God?” The answer is in his heart: “You do not call to account” (לֹא תִדְרֹשׁ). The verb brings the thread back to v. 4. A theology of impunity authorizes contempt.

The Psalter elsewhere insists on the opposite: “דֹּרֵשׁ דָּמִים אֹתָם זָכָר; לֹא־שָׁכַח צַעֲקַת עֲנִיִּים” (“The One who requires blood remembered them; He did not forget the cry of the afflicted,” Ps 9:13). Psalm 10 is in dialogue with Psalm 9 at exactly this point: remembrance and requital against the wicked’s creed of forgetfulness and non-reckoning.

**Verse 14**

רָאִיתָה—כִּי אַתָּה עָמָל וָכַעַס תַּבִּיט—לָתֵת בְּיָדֶךָ; עָלֶיךָ יַעֲזֹב חֵלֵכָה; יָתוֹם אַתָּה הָיִיתָ עוֹזֵר׃

This is the psalm’s hinge. The fronted perfect “רָאִיתָה” (“You have seen/You do see”) answers v. 11’s “He will never see” with an emphatic contradiction. The reason clause specifies what God sees: “עָמָל וָכַעַס”—mischief and vexation. The purpose clause “לָתֵת בְּיָדֶךָ” means “to take [it] into Your hand”—to take charge of redressing it. Rashi, pressed by the Hebrew, reads “to give him his recompense.”

“עָלֶיךָ יַעֲזֹב חֵלֵכָה”—the helpless “leaves” his burden “upon You,” a Hebrew idiom for entrusting (compare “גּוֹל עַל־יְהוָה דַּרְכֶּךָ,” “Commit your way to the LORD,” Ps 37:5). Finally, “יָתוֹם… עוֹזֵר”—“You have been the orphan’s helper.” The perfect (“have been”) appeals to God’s track record to secure present intervention. Deuteronomy’s portrait of God—“עֹשֶׂה מִשְׁפַּט יָתוֹם וְאַלְמָנָה”—is the theological underneath.

The verse’s rhythm (assertion—cause—purpose—entrustment—appeal to precedent) models a way to argue with God: tell Him what He has been and thus what He must be.

**Verse 15**

שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רָשָׁע; וָרָע תִּדְרֹשׁ רִשְׁעוֹ; בַּל־תִּמְצָא׃

The imperative, now muscular. “Break the arm of the wicked.” Then the verb darash in its climactic turn: “Seek out his wickedness until you find none”—that is, investigate thoroughly until evil is exhausted. Radak reads the line as promise: if You do this, “לא תמצא רשע בארץ,” “You will not find wickedness in the land.” The imagery is political: to “break the arm” is to disable power structures (Jer 48:25). The Talmud connects our verse to the petition against malicious sectarians in the Amidah (Megillah 17b), and Ashkenazi Yom Kippur poetry uses it as a communal plea for the end of oppression: “שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רֶשַׁע.”

The line thus rewrites the wicked’s creed. Against “You do not seek” stands “Seek!”; against “I shall not be moved” stands the broken arm. The imperative form matters: it gives the worshiper words to demand that God be God.

**Verse 16**

יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ עוֹלָם וָעֶד; אָבְדוּ גוֹיִם מֵאַרְצוֹ׃

A burst of doxology. “The LORD is king forever and ever.” The second colon uses a perfect, “אָבְדוּ,” “have perished,” to describe a reality future to the psalmist but certain in the horizon of faith. This “prophetic perfect” functions liturgically as a declaration that, even in apparent absence, God rules, and that earthly powers—“גוֹיִם”—are temporary tenants in “His land.”

This verse stands, in Sefardic Pesukei DeZimra, immediately after “יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ; יְהוָה מָלָךְ; יְהוָה יִמְלֹךְ לְעוֹלָם וָעֶד” and before “יְהוָה הֵפִיר עֲצַת גּוֹיִם” (“The LORD foils the plans of nations,” Ps 33:10). The juxtaposition is the psalm’s best interpreter. God’s kingship is not a pious overlay; it is public truth, visibly contradicted for a time by wicked success but finally vindicated as counsel proves futile.

**Verse 17**

תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים שָׁמַעְתָּ יְהוָה; תָּכִין לִבָּם; תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ׃

Perfect followed by imperfects: “You have heard… You will establish… You will incline.” The object—“תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים,” the desire of the lowly—answers v. 3’s “תַּאֲוַת נַפְשׁוֹ,” the appetite of the wicked. What God hears is not appetite but prayer-shaped longing for justice. “תָּכִין לִבָּם,” “You will make their hearts firm,” resonates in High Holiday liturgy: “תָּכִין לִבָּם, תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ”—God prepares the heart that prays and bends His ear to hear it.

The verb “קשב” (to pay close attention) casts God as the opposite of the wicked’s creed of divine blindness. Psalm 71:2 uses the same idiom: “הַטֵּה אֵלַי אָזְנֶךָ, וְהוֹשִׁיעֵנִי” (“Incline Your ear to me, and deliver me”). Listening itself is an act of salvation.

**Verse 18**

לִשְׁפֹּט יָתוֹם וָדָךְ; בַּל־יוֹסִיף עוֹד לַעֲרֹץ אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָרֶץ׃

The finale states the purpose. “לִשְׁפֹּט”—to judge in the biblical sense of vindicating the right of the powerless (Deut 10:18: “עֹשֶׂה מִשְׁפַּט יָתוֹם וְאַלְמָנָה”). The subjects are the “יָתוֹם” and the “דָּךְ” (crushed/lowly). The result: “בַּל־יוֹסִיף עוֹד לַעֲרֹץ”—“that he will no longer continue to terrify.” The verb “עָרַץ” in the causative (“terrify”) elsewhere forbids fear of enemies (Deut 1:29: “אַל־תַּעַרְצוּן,” “do not be terrified”); here it stigmatizes the oppressor’s chief weapon: fear.

The oppressor is named “אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָרֶץ,” “a mortal of the earth”—a precise, deflating term. In contrast to “יְהוָה מֶלֶךְ עוֹלָם,” God is eternal; man is earth-bound. Radak comments that this emphasizes both mortality and limited power. The psalm closes by restoring perspective: the affliction is real and named; the terror is human and temporary; the kingship is divine and forever.

In sum: Psalm 10 offers us not an explanation but a practice. It teaches how to protest, how to diagnose, how to demand, and how to praise—until the act of speaking to God undercuts the wicked’s line that no one is listening.
