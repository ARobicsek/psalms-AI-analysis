### INTRODUCTION ESSAY (already written for this psalm)
# Psalm 145: The Alphabet of Divine Kingship

Psalm 145 stands alone in the Psalter as the only composition bearing the superscription *tehillah* (תְּהִלָּה, "praise")—a remarkable distinction given that the entire collection is known as *Tehillim*. This singular designation signals something essential about the psalm's nature: it represents praise distilled to its essence, a comprehensive theology of divine sovereignty structured as an alphabetic acrostic that moves systematically from personal devotion to cosmic acclaim.

The psalm's acrostic framework—nearly complete, missing only the *nun* (נ) line—creates what we might call an "A to Z" completeness of praise. Yet this is no mere pedagogical device. The alphabetic structure serves a deeper theological purpose, suggesting that praising God encompasses the full range of human expression and experience. From *aleph* to *tav*, the psalmist constructs a universe where divine kingship permeates every dimension of existence, from the intimate ("my God the King," v. 1) to the universal ("all flesh," v. 21).

The psalm's architecture reveals a carefully orchestrated movement. The opening verses (1-3) establish the eternal scope of praise with the refrain *le'olam va'ed* (לְעוֹלָם וָעֶד, "forever and ever"), while verses 4-7 introduce the crucial theme of generational transmission: *dor ledor* (דּוֹר לְדוֹר, "generation to generation"). This is more than temporal continuity; it suggests that divine praise requires active human participation across time. The rare verb *yabbi'u* (יַבִּיעוּ) in verse 7, meaning "to gush forth," transforms the memory of God's goodness into an overflowing spring of spontaneous worship.

At the psalm's center lies verse 8, the classic divine mercy formula: *chanun verachum YHWH, erekh appayim ugdol-chasad* (חַנּוּן וְרַחוּם יְהוָה אֶרֶךְ אַפַּיִם וּגְדׇל־חָסֶד, "gracious and compassionate is the LORD, slow to anger and abounding in kindness"). This creedal statement, echoing Exodus 34:6, functions as the theological hinge of the acrostic. Here, divine character—not merely divine power—becomes the foundation for universal praise. The psalmist places mercy, not majesty, at the structural heart of the poem.

What follows this theological center is the psalm's most audacious claim: the movement from particular to universal scope. Verses 9-13 expand God's compassion to encompass "all his works" (*kol-ma'asav*, כׇּל־מַעֲשָׂיו), not merely Israel. This theological breakthrough anticipates the psalm's climax, where divine kingship is proclaimed as *malkut kol-olamim* (מַֽלְכוּת כׇּל־עֹלָמִ֑ים, "kingdom of all worlds," v. 13). The phrase mirrors Ugaritic royal formulae celebrating Baal's eternal dominion, but here serves to subordinate all competing claims to divine rule under Israel's God.

The psalm's final movement (vv. 14-20) performs a remarkable rhetorical pivot. Having established cosmic sovereignty, the poet zooms in on intimate divine care. God "supports the fallen" (*nophilim*, נֹּפְלִים) and "straightens the bent" (*kephufim*, כְּפוּפִים, v. 14). The imagery shifts from cosmic king to attentive provider, as divine hands literally "open" (*poteach*, פּוֹתֵחַ) to feed every living creature (v. 16). This juxtaposition is theologically radical: true divine kingship is measured not by conquest but by compassion, not by dominance but by provision.

The psalm's treatment of divine justice proves equally sophisticated. Verse 20 creates a stark distinction between those who "love" God (*ohavav*, אֹהֲבָיו) and "the wicked" (*harsha'im*, הָרְשָׁעִים), seemingly contradicting the universal mercy proclaimed earlier. Yet this is not a theological inconsistency but a moral one. The psalm suggests that divine love extends universally, but divine protection requires human response. Those who "call upon him in truth" (*be'emet*, בֶאֱמֶת, v. 18) enter into covenant relationship; those who reject this relationship face the consequences of their choice.

The psalm's linguistic texture reveals additional layers of meaning. The triple accumulation of glory terms in verse 5—*hadar kevod hodekha* (הֲדַר כְּב֣וֹד הוֹדֶךָ, "the splendor of your glorious majesty")—creates an almost overwhelmed attempt to capture divine magnificence in human language. Similarly, the missing *nun* line may not represent textual corruption but theological precision: even the most complete human praise remains incomplete before divine mystery. The LXX's addition of verse 13a ("Faithful is the LORD in his words") attempts to fill this gap, but the Hebrew tradition preserves the telling absence.

The psalm's historical context illuminates its theological achievement. Composed likely during the Second Temple period, when Israelite political autonomy was limited or absent, Psalm 145 proclaims divine kingship as an alternative to failed human rule. Yet rather than retreating into otherworldly spirituality, the psalm grounds divine sovereignty in concrete acts of provision and care. God's kingdom manifests not in military conquest but in opened hands and satisfied creatures.

The poem's liturgical function becomes evident in its progression from individual voice ("I will extol you," v. 1) to corporate summons ("let all flesh bless," v. 21). This movement suggests that personal praise catalyzes universal worship. The psalm provides a template for how individual devotion expands into cosmic celebration, making every worshiper a participant in the divine kingdom's proclamation.

Psalm 145 thus represents more than royal theology or wisdom literature; it offers a comprehensive vision of reality organized around divine kingship expressed through divine care. By structuring this vision as an alphabetic acrostic, the psalmist suggests that such kingship encompasses the totality of existence. From *aleph* to *tav*, from "my God" to "all flesh," the psalm constructs a world where ultimate power serves ultimate love, and where human praise participates in the very governance of creation. In earning its unique designation as *tehillah*, this psalm became not merely an example of praise but its defining expression—the alphabetic blueprint for how heaven and earth join in acknowledging the one true King.

### MACRO THESIS
**Thesis**: Psalm 145 presents a comprehensive theology of divine kingship that systematically moves from personal devotion to cosmic sovereignty, demonstrating how individual praise participates in and catalyzes universal acknowledgment of YHWH's eternal reign. The acrostic structure creates an 'A to Z' completeness of praise that encompasses both God's transcendent majesty and immanent care, establishing a paradigm where divine greatness is measured not only by power but by compassionate provision for all creation.
**Genre**: Acrostic Hymn of Praise with Royal Theology
**Context**: This psalm likely functioned as a liturgical centerpiece in Second Temple worship, designed to affirm YHWH's sovereignty in contexts where Israelite political autonomy was limited or threatened. The Davidic attribution and extensive royal vocabulary suggest it served as a theological counterpoint to human kingship, proclaiming God's eternal reign when earthly kingdoms proved temporary and fallible. The acrostic form indicates careful liturgical composition for memorization and communal recitation.

**Structure**:
  - vv. 1-3: Personal vow of eternal praise and God's incomparable greatness
  - vv. 4-7: Generational transmission of God's mighty works
  - vv. 8-9: Divine character attributes (creedal center)
  - vv. 10-13: Universal praise and proclamation of eternal kingship
  - vv. 14-20: Divine royal care and provision for creation
  - v. 21: Climactic call for universal praise

**Poetic Devices**:
  - acrostic structure: Hebrew alphabetic poem (missing nun) creating systematic completeness
  - inclusio: Praise terminology frames the psalm (tehillah/tehillat) with 'forever and ever' refrain
  - anaphora: Repetitive 'Your/You' address throughout, creating sustained direct divine address
  - synonymous parallelism: Parallel lines reinforcing the same concept, especially around kingship and care themes
  - chiasmus: AB|BA pattern in several verses, particularly around divine action
  - merismus: Expression of totality through paired opposites or comprehensive terms

**Research Questions** (from Macro Analyst):
  1. What is the significance of the missing nun (נ) line in this acrostic, and how do ancient versions handle this gap?
  2. How does the progression from 'my God the King' (v.1) to 'all flesh' (v.21) function liturgically to move worshippers from personal to cosmic perspective?
  3. What is the relationship between the divine mercy formula (v.8) and the ancient Near Eastern royal ideology evident in the kingship vocabulary?
  4. How does the Ugaritic parallel in v.13 ('eternal kingship/dominion for all generations') illuminate the psalm's use of royal formulae?
  5. What does the juxtaposition of God's cosmic sovereignty (vv.10-13) with detailed care for the hungry and fallen (vv.14-16) suggest about Israelite kingship theology?
  6. How do the temporal markers ('every day,' 'forever and ever,' 'generation to generation') function to create a comprehensive temporal scope?
  7. What is the significance of the shift from third-person praise ('they shall talk,' vv.6-7) to direct divine address ('You give,' vv.15-16)?
  8. How does the final verse's movement from 'my mouth' to 'all flesh' encapsulate the psalm's theological trajectory?
  9. What role does the 'fear/love' distinction (vv.19-20) play in defining the boundaries of God's protective care?
  10. How does this psalm's portrayal of divine kingship compare to other royal psalms in terms of emphasizing care over conquest?

**Thematic Threads Across Verses:**
  - Acrostic structure missing nun (נ) - intentional gap in completeness?
  - Progression from 2nd person (vv.1-2) to 3rd person (v.3) to mixed personal/communal voices
  - Royal terminology intensifies through middle section (vv.10-13) then shifts to care imagery
  - Universal scope expands: 'my God' → 'all works' → 'all flesh' → 'sons of men' → 'all flesh'
  - Temporal framework: 'forever and ever' creates inclusio with daily/generational emphasis
  - Divine mercy formula (v.8) serves as theological hinge between transcendence and care themes
  - Sound patterns in Hebrew show careful crafting (requires phonetic analysis for specifics)


**Interesting Questions** (from Micro Analyst):
  1. Why is this the only psalm titled 'tehillah' (praise) when the entire collection is 'tehillim'?
  2. What is the significance of the missing nun in this acrostic - scribal error or theological statement?
  3. How does the triple glory accumulation 'הֲדַר כְּבוֹד הוֹדֶךָ' function - are these distinct concepts or poetic intensification?
  4. Why does the LXX add verse 13a ('Faithful is the Lord in his words') not found in Hebrew manuscripts?
  5. How does the psalm resolve the tension between universal mercy (v.9) and destruction of the wicked (v.20)?
  6. What is the relationship between 'those who fear him' (v.19) and 'those who love him' (v.20) - same group or progression?
  7. Why does the psalm shift from cosmic kingship (vv.11-13) to individual care (vv.14-16) - theological strategy or liturgical function?
  8. How does the rare verb 'yabbi'u' (gush forth, v.7) contribute to the psalm's imagery of spontaneous praise?
  9. What does the phrase 'in truth' (be'emet, v.18) specifically require for divine accessibility?
  10. How does the final 'all flesh' (kol-basar) relate to earlier universal terms like 'all works' and 'sons of men'?

**Synthesis Notes for Research:**

## Traditional Commentaries

Classical interpretations from traditional Jewish commentators on key verses.

### Psalms 145:1
**Why this verse**: Unique tehillah superscription - why this psalm alone bears the title of the entire collection  

#### Ibn Ezra
**Hebrew**: תהלה לדוד ארוממך - בדבור ובאמונת הלב. | והזכיר המלך – כי הוא המלך באמת וזהו יסוד כל התהלה הזאת. | ואברכה שמך - להוסיף על רוממותיך. והנה הטעם שאדבר שאתה מרומם.  

---

#### Radak
**Hebrew**: תהילה. אלה הששה מזמורים עד סוף הספר הם כולם תהילת האל יתברך ושבחו לפיכך החל בהם ומשלים בהם בתהילה לגודל התהילה וזה המזמור תחילת הפסוק הראשון תהילה ותחילת הפסוק האחרון תהילה והחמשה הללויה בראש ובסוף והכל לגודל התהילה ומתי תהיה תהילת האל גדולה, בקבוץ גליות שיראו כל העם הנפלאות שיעשה עם ישראל לפיכך הזכיר בהם קיבוץ גליות ובנין ירושלים, המזמור הזה תהילה לאל יתברך לפיכך חיברו באל"ף בי"ת ולא חיבר את הנו"...  

**English**: Tehillah (A Praise): These six psalms until the end of the book are all praises of the Blessed God and His glory. Therefore, they begin and end with praise, reflecting the greatness of praise. This psalm starts with the word "Tehillah" in the first verse and also concludes with "Tehillah" in the last verse. The other five psalms start and end with "Hallelujah," all highlighting the greatness of pr...

---

#### Malbim
**Hebrew**: ארוממך אלוהי המלך, ה' נעלם מצד עצמו ונגלה מצד פעולותיו, והרוממות הוא מן הצד שהוא מתרומם ונעלם מן ההשגה, ואמר שאתה אלוהי מצד עצמך מרומם מכל ברכה ותהלה, אולם אברכה שמך שמצד שמך שהוא הפרסום שנתפרסמת ע"י ההנהגה, מצד זה אברכך, וגדר הברכה שמברכים את ה' הוא השפע והטוב היורד מאת ה' אל עולמו ע"י צדקת התחתונים, אתה מקור הברכה והטוב, ויציינהו כמלך הנסתר בכבודו מרומם מכל שריו ועבדיו, ובכ"ז יוצא מאתו ברכה וטוב...

#### Radak
**Hebrew**: חנון ורחום. אלה המדות שהם טוב וצדקה מאתו יביעו וירננו כי הוא חנון שחונן הבריות ונותן להם צרכם ורחום שמרחם וחומל עליהם ושומר אותם מן הנזקים ומפגעי העולם: | ארך אפים. שמאריך אפו לרשעים ולא יענשם מיד: | וגדל חסד. הדל"ת בקמ"ץ חטף אמר שהוא גדול חסד שמגדיל חסדו על בני אדם יותר ממה שהם ראויין לקבל: | טוב ה' לכל. אפי' למיני החיות והבהמות והעופות הוא טוב ומרחם וכן ראוי לאדם ללכת בדרכיו אלה ואין לו להשחית ה...  

**English**: Gracious and compassionate: These are the attributes by which He expresses His goodness and righteousness. They shall utter and sing of Him, for He is gracious, granting favor to creatures and providing for their needs, and compassionate, showing mercy and pity towards them, protecting them from harm and the world's afflictions. | Slow to anger: He delays His anger towards the wicked and does not ...

**Hebrew**: חנון. נותן מתנת חנם: | ארך אפים. אינו ממהר לכעוס: | וגדל חסד. עושה חסדים גדולים:  

---

#### Malbim
**Hebrew**: שרחום וחנון ה', ושכל מעשיו הם מצד החנינה והרחמים, וגם בענשו את הרשעים הוא ארך אפים, ואינו מעניש תיכף, ורב חסד אם ישובו בתשובה:  

---

#### Meiri

**Why this verse**: LXX addition of verse 13a not in Hebrew - textual and theological implications  

#### Ibn Ezra
**Hebrew**: מלכותך - כל מלכות תפסק ומלכות השם עומדת לנצח.  

---

#### Radak
**Hebrew**: מלכותך. אינה מלכות בן אדם שיש לה הפסק או בחייו או במותו אבל מלכות האל יתב' אין לה הפסק כי מלכותו מלכות כל העולמים כל הזמנים וכפל הענין במלות שונות:  

**English**: Thy kingdom (מלכותך): It is not a kingdom of a human being that has an end either in his life or in his death, but the kingdom of the Almighty, may He be blessed, has no end, for His kingdom is the kingdom of all worlds, all times, and repeated in different words.

**Hebrew**: מלכותך מלכות כל עולמים כלומ׳ שאין לה הפסק כמלכות בשר ודם וכן ממשלתך בכל דור ודור.

### Psalms 145:20
**Why this verse**: Tension between universal mercy (v.9) and destruction of wicked - theological resolution  

#### Ibn Ezra
**Hebrew**: שומר - אם באה צרה ליריאיו יושיעם, רק אוהביו הוא ישמור אותם לא תבא להם רעה. | ואת כל הרשעים ישמיד - באחרונה, כי סופם הוא לאבדון והמלך לא יוכל להשמיד רשעי ארצו אולי יקשרו עליו, על כן יפחד או לא יכירם כי לא ידע הנסתרות והשלים כאשר החל.  

---

#### Radak
**Hebrew**: שומר ה' את כל אוהביו. טובים מיראיו כי אהבוהו ללא תקות טובה ולא מפחד עונש אלא מאהבה זכה וישמרם שלא בא עליהם צרה לעולם וכן יהיו כל ישראל לעתיד לבא: ואז ואת כל הרשעים ישמיד. שלא ישאר רשע לעולם כמו שאומר והיו כל זדים וכל עושי רשעה קש ולהט אום היום הבא וגו':  

**English**: The Lord preserves all those who love him (שומר ה' את כל אוהביו): He is good to those who fear Him, for they love Him without expectation of reward or fear of punishment, but purely out of love. He guards them so that no calamity will ever come upon them, and so it will be with all Israel in the future. But all the wicked he will destroy (ואת כל הרשעים ישמיד): There will not remain a wicked person...

## YOUR TASK: WRITE VERSE-BY-VERSE COMMENTARY

For EACH verse in the psalm, write a commentary annotation that draws on diverse scholarly angles:

**LENGTH GUIDELINES:**
- **Target length**: 150-400 words per verse
- **Can be longer** (400+ words) if there's a genuinely interesting finding or insight that merits extended illumination
- Let the content determine the length - don't pad or artificially constrain

### ITEMS OF INTEREST TO ILLUMINATE (when relevant to the verse):

The following areas are of particular interest to intelligent, well-read lay readers who desire poetic, literary, linguistic, and historical insights:

1. **Phonetics & Sound Patterns (CRITICAL)**
   - You are provided with an authoritative phonetic transcription for each verse (e.g., `**Phonetic**: po-te-akh et-ya-de-kha`).
   - **USE THIS DATA**: When discussing alliteration, assonance, or other sound-based poetic devices, you MUST base your claims on this transcription, not on modern pronunciation.
   - **VERIFY CLAIMS**: For example, before claiming a "soft 'f' sound," check the transcription. If it says `p` (e.g., in `po-te-akh`), your claim is incorrect. The transcription is your ground truth for all phonetic analysis. Distinguish `p` vs `f`, `b` vs `v`, `k` vs `kh`.

2. **Poetics**
   - Parallelism types (synonymous, antithetical, synthetic, climactic)
   - Wordplay (paronomasia, alliteration, assonance) - *Must be verified with phonetic transcription*
   - Meter and rhythm
   - Structural devices (chiasm, inclusio, envelope structure)
   - **Unusual turns of phrase**: When a verse contains an interesting or unusual Hebrew phrase, idiom, or construction (like הֲ֭דַר כְּב֣וֹד הוֹדֶ֑ךָ or עֱז֣וּז נֽוֹרְאֹתֶ֣יךָ), comment on it - explain what makes it distinctive, how it functions poetically, and what it contributes to the verse's meaning

   **Figurative Language Integration (CRITICAL):**
   For each verse containing figurative language where the research provided relevant biblical parallels:
   1. **Identify the image** and explain its meaning in this specific context
   2. **Cite compelling parallel uses** from the figurative language database (at least 1-2 specific references with book/chapter/verse)
   3. **Analyze the pattern**: How common is this image? How is it typically used across Scripture?
   4. **Note distinctive features**: How does this psalm's use differ from or extend typical usage?

   Example: "The 'opened hand' imagery (v. 16) appears 23 times in Scripture as an idiom for generosity (Deut 15:8, 11). Psalm 145 distinctively applies this human obligation metaphor to divine providence, transforming covenant ethics into cosmic theology."

2. **Literary Insights**
   - Narrative techniques and rhetorical strategies
   - Genre conventions and innovations
   - Dramatic progression and turning points
   - Imagery and its function
   - Irony, hyperbole, understatement

3. **Historical and Cultic Insights**
   - Liturgical setting and worship context
   - Historical period indicators (vocabulary, theology, cultural references)
   - Temple/sanctuary practices
   - Royal psalms and kingship theology
   - Festival associations (Sukkot, Passover, New Year, etc.)

4. **Comparative Religion**
   - Ancient Near Eastern parallels (Ugaritic, Akkadian, Egyptian)
   - Polemic against Canaanite/Mesopotamian religion
   - Appropriation and transformation of ANE motifs
   - Cite specific texts (KTU numbers, Enuma Elish, etc.)

5. **Grammar and Syntax** (when illuminating)
   - Rare or ambiguous grammatical forms
   - Verb tenses and aspect (especially jussive, cohortative, imperative)
   - Word order significance
   - Difficult constructions that affect meaning

6. **Textual Criticism**
   - Comparison of Masoretic Text (MT) vs Septuagint (LXX)
   - What LXX choices reveal about the Vorlage (Hebrew base text)
   - Textual variants and their implications
   - Translation challenges and scholarly debates

7. **Lexical Analysis**
   - Etymology when theologically illuminating
   - Semantic range of key terms (use BDB data)
   - Rare vocabulary and hapax legomena
   - Technical terminology (legal, cultic, military, agricultural)

8. **Comparative Biblical Usage**
   - Concordance insights: how this word/phrase appears elsewhere
   - Development of theological concepts across Scripture
   - Formulaic language and its variations
   - Quotation and allusion to other biblical texts

9. **Figurative Language**
   - How vehicles (metaphors, similes) function in this verse
   - How the same figurative vehicles are used across Scripture
   - Target-vehicle-ground-posture analysis
   - Evolution of metaphorical meaning

10. **Timing/Composition Clues**
    - Vocabulary that suggests dating (Persian loanwords, Aramaisms, etc.)
    - Theological development indicators
    - Historical allusions (Babylonian exile, monarchy, etc.)
    - Liturgical evolution markers

11. **Traditional Interpretation**
    - Classical Jewish commentary (Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Radak, Kimchi)
    - Targum renderings
    - Church fathers (Augustine, Jerome, etc.)
    - Medieval Christian interpretation
    - Modern critical scholarship debates

### VALIDATION CHECK - Figurative Language:

Before finalizing, review each verse with figurative language identified in the research:
- ✓ Does the commentary cite at least ONE specific biblical parallel from the database?
- ✓ Does it use the comparison to generate an insight about THIS verse?
- ✓ Does it provide pattern analysis (e.g., "This imagery appears 11x in Psalms, predominantly in contexts of...")?

If any check fails, REVISE to incorporate comparative analysis using the database.

### IMPORTANT NOTES:

- **Relationship to Introduction Essay**: You have the complete introduction essay. Your verse commentary should COMPLEMENT (not repeat) the introduction. If the introduction discussed a theme at length, you can allude to it briefly but focus on verse-specific details not covered in the introduction.
- **Address interesting questions**: The Macro and Micro analysts have identified interesting research questions (see their inputs above). When commenting on specific verses, if any of these questions are relevant to that verse and can be meaningfully answered with the available research materials, address them in your commentary.
- **Independence from macro thesis**: The verse commentary need NOT always relate to the macro thesis - follow what's interesting in each verse
- **Reader interest**: Focus on what would genuinely interest and inform an intelligent, well-read lay reader who desires poetic, literary, linguistic, and historical insights
- **Flexibility**: Some verses may focus on poetics, others on Vorlage, others on Ugaritic parallels, others on figurative language patterns - let the verse and research materials guide you
- **Depth over breadth**: Better to explore 2-3 angles deeply than mention everything superficially
- **Evidence-based**: Ground all observations in the research materials provided (BDB, concordances, figurative language database, traditional commentaries)
- **Use research bundle effectively**: The research bundle contains:
  * BDB lexicon entries with semantic ranges, etymologies, and usage patterns
  * Concordance data showing where Hebrew terms appear elsewhere in Scripture - cite these parallels!
  * Figurative language instances showing how vehicles/metaphors are used across the Bible
  * Traditional commentary excerpts from Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Radak - engage with these interpretive traditions!
  * LXX text showing ancient Greek interpretation
- **Define technical terms**: When using jargon (jussive, anaphora, chiasm, inclusio, polemic, theophany, etc.), provide brief, accessible definitions for lay readers
- **Vary your approach**: Don't use the same scholarly angles for every verse - alternate between poetics, historical context, textual criticism, figurative analysis, etc.
- **Comment on unusual phrases and poetic devices**: When a verse contains interesting or unusual Hebrew phrases, idioms, wordplay, or poetic devices, make sure to comment on them. These linguistic and literary features are precisely what intelligent lay readers find fascinating.

### FORMAT FOR EACH VERSE:

**Verse [N]**
[150-300 words of commentary drawing on relevant scholarly angles]

---

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

- **Cover ALL verses** in the psalm
- **Length**: 150-400 words per verse (can and should be longer—400+ words—if there's genuinely interesting material to illuminate, such as unusual Hebrew phrases, complex poetic devices, significant textual variants, or important interpretive questions to address)
- **Variety**: Don't use the same angles for every verse - vary your approach across poetics, textual criticism, figurative language, historical context, etc.
- **Evidence**: Cite Hebrew terms, concordance patterns, research findings, traditional commentators
- **Readability**: Scholarly but accessible for intelligent lay readers (New Yorker/Atlantic level)
- **Define terms**: Explain technical terminology when used
- **Independence**: Don't force connections to the macro thesis if they're not natural - follow what's interesting in each verse
- **Emphasize the interesting**: Make sure to comment on unusual turns of phrase, distinctive Hebrew idioms, and poetic devices. These are what make the commentary valuable and engaging.
