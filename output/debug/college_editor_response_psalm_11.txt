### EDITORIAL ASSESSMENT

The existing introduction and commentary are intellectually strong: they know the Hebrew very well, bring in classical commentators intelligently, and notice real poetic features (the darkness vs. divine vision contrast; the Sodom echo; the testing language; the unresolved question in v. 3). For a graduate seminar, this would already be solid work.

For a first‑year college student, though, there are problems:

- **Jargon load.** Terms like “epistemological binary,” “bicolon,” “ontological,” “theodicy,” “typological,” “anthropomorphism” appear with little or no explanation. A very capable student could follow, but will be working too hard just to decode the vocabulary.
- **Density and pacing.** Long, clause-heavy sentences and frequent digressions into lexica (BDB) and secondary debates slow the reading and bury the main line of the psalm’s argument.
- **Missed teaching moments.** Some great bits in the research bundle are underused:  
  – The vivid midrash Rashi cites (the flax worker) is mentioned but could be unpacked more;  
  – The Torah Temimah’s Sanhedrin passage tying our psalm to Shebna/Hezekiah is not integrated;  
  – The related psalms (7, 36, 58, 64) are noted in the RAG but not really used to show patterns.  
- **Liturgical section** is incomplete and does not quote the actual prayers; students who know the siddur will want to *see* how the psalm’s phrases live liturgically.
- **Tone.** The tone is more like a published article than a conversation with a bright undergrad: not much direct engagement (“Notice how…”) or concrete analogies.

The revisions should therefore: (1) keep the good close reading, but explain every technical term; (2) simplify and clarify sentences; (3) foreground the drama and structure of the psalm; (4) integrate key rabbinic and liturgical pieces with actual Hebrew + English quotations; (5) use related psalms selectively to show how Ps 11 fits a broader pattern of “trust under pressure.”

## REVISED INTRODUCTION

### A quick map of Psalm 11

Psalm 11 is short—only seven verses—but it stages a whole argument about how to live when the world feels like it’s falling apart.

The basic situation:

- The speaker opens with a bold claim: **“בַּֽיהוָה חָסִיתִי” – “In the LORD I have taken refuge”** (v. 1). The verb *חסיתי* (from חָסָה) is the standard “I’m hiding under God’s protection” verb in Psalms.
- Immediately, someone (friends? advisers? his own fear?) tells him: **run.**  
  “אֵיךְ תֹּאמְרוּ לְנַפְשִׁי: נוּדִי הַרְכֶם צִפּוֹר” –  
  “How can you say to me: ‘Flee to your mountain, bird!’” (v. 1).
- They back this up with a whole picture of ambush and collapse (vv. 2–3).
- The psalmist responds not with a counter‑plan but with a *theological* counter‑view: God is enthroned, God sees, God tests, God will judge; and in the end “the upright will behold His face” (vv. 4–7).

So the psalm is really a debate between two perspectives:

> “The foundations are destroyed, the wicked are hunting you: **run.**”  
> versus  
> “The foundations may be destroyed, but the LORD is on His throne: **stay.**”

### The little drama in vv. 1–3: “Foundations destroyed—what can a righteous person do?”

The quoted speech in verses 1–3 is one of the most interesting parts of the psalm. Verses 2–3 describe the situation:

- **Assassins in the dark:**  
  “כִּי הִנֵּה הָרְשָׁעִים יִדְרְכוּן קֶשֶׁת, כּוֹנְנוּ חִצָּם עַל־יֶתֶר, לִירוֹת בְּמוֹ־אֹפֶל לְיִשְׁרֵי־לֵב”  
  “For see, the wicked bend the bow, they have set their arrow on the string, to shoot in the dark at the upright of heart” (v. 2).  

  Notice the three‑step sequence: **bend** (יִדְרְכוּן), **set** (כּוֹנְנוּ), **shoot** (לִירוֹת). It’s almost cinematic: you can see the bow being drawn in slow motion.

- **Moral collapse:**  
  “כִּי הַשָּׁתוֹת יֵהָרֵסוּן, צַדִּיק מַה־פָּעָל”  
  “For when the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?” (v. 3).

The mysterious word **הַשָּׁתוֹת** (*hashshatot*) is a key here. It comes from the root שׁית, “to set, place,” so it probably means “the things everything else is set on”—**foundations.**  

Classical commentators play with this:

- Radak: “הַשָּׁתוֹת הֵם הַיְסוֹדוֹת – the *shatot* are the foundations,” and he takes this as the moral and social order—laws, institutions, the people who should be pillars.
- Rashi, reading the psalm in the context of David, points at specific people: the priests of Nov, “foundations of the world,” who were massacred by Saul. If *they* can be killed, what hope is there?

The second half, **“צַדִּיק מַה־פָּעָל”**, is deliciously ambiguous. *Pā‘al* is a perfect (“has done”), but in Hebrew it can also carry a “what can he do?” sense. So you can read:

- “What **has** the righteous person done [wrong]?” (protest of innocence), or
- “What **can** the righteous person do [now]?” (despair).

The psalm never explicitly answers the question. Instead, it changes the subject. That’s the move in verse 4.

### From horizontal panic to vertical vision: God in His temple, God in heaven

Verse 4 is the hinge:

> “יְהוָה בְּהֵיכַל קׇדְשׁוֹ; יְהוָה בַשָּׁמַיִם כִּסְאוֹ.  
> עֵינָיו יֶחֱזוּ; עַפְעַפָּיו יִבְחֲנוּ בְּנֵי אָדָם.”  
> “The LORD is in His holy temple;  
> the LORD—His throne is in heaven.  
> His eyes behold; His eyelids test human beings.”

We suddenly shift from the **horizontal** plane (wicked vs. righteous on earth, running to the mountains) to the **vertical**: temple below, throne above. Ancient Israelite thinking didn’t treat these as separate locations. Either:

- “His holy temple” itself is the heavenly temple (Ibn Ezra: “הֵיכַל קׇדְשׁוֹ הֵם הַשָּׁמַיִם”), or  
- The earthly temple and the heavenly throne room are linked—temple as the **earthly outpost of heaven**.

Either way, the point is that God is both **enthroned** and **attentive.**

The second half of the verse zooms in on God’s sight:

- “עֵינָיו יֶחֱזוּ” – “His **eyes** behold” (the verb חזה often means “to see in a focused way,” like a seer’s vision).
- “עַפְעַפָּיו יִבְחֲנוּ” – “His **eyelids** test.”  

“Eyelids” (*‘af‘appayv*) is wonderfully odd. Why not just “eyes” twice? Many readers imagine the narrowed eyes of someone scrutinizing something carefully. The verb “יְבַחֵן” (*yivḥan*) means “to test, examine,” and in other places it’s used for assaying metal in a furnace (e.g., Zech 13:9).

Set this against verse 2:

- Wicked shoot **“בְּמוֹ־אֹפֶל” – “in deep darkness”**  
- God’s eyes and even His eyelids **see through the dark**.

So the basic theological move is:  
You think the problem is that they can hurt you unseen. The reality is: no one is unseen.

### Testing and hating: how does God relate to righteous and wicked?

Verse 5 continues the theme of examination:

> “יְהוָה צַדִּיק יִבְחָן;  
> וְרָשָׁע וְאֹהֵב חָמָס שָׂנְאָה נַפְשׁוֹ.”  
> “The LORD tests the righteous,  
> but the wicked and the lover of violence His soul hates.”

Here two things are going on:

1. **Testing the righteous.**  
   Traditional Jewish commentators rush to make sure you don’t misread this as “God is picking on good people.” Rashi quotes a famous parable: the **flax worker** beats high‑quality flax more, because it can handle the blows and become something durable. Cheap flax falls apart quickly, so he barely bothers with it.  

   On this reading, being “tested” (*נִבְחָן*) is almost a compliment: God thinks your faith is strong enough to refine.

2. **Hating the lover of violence.**  
   The object isn’t just “the wicked” (*רָשָׁע*), but “וְאֹהֵב חָמָס” – “one who **loves** violence.” *חָמָס* in the Bible is not random aggression; it’s the systemic wrong that filled the earth before the Flood: “וְתִמָּלֵא הָאָרֶץ חָמָס” (Gen 6:11).  

   The phrase “שָׂנְאָה נַפְשׁוֹ” – “His **soul** hates” – is anthropomorphic language (that is, giving God human‑like traits). It underlines that God’s opposition here is not cold or indifferent; it’s deeply rooted in who God is.  

   The final verse will say “כִּי צַדִּיק יְהוָה” – “For the LORD is righteous” (v. 7). A righteous God simply cannot be neutral about someone who *loves* destructiveness.

### Judgment as anti‑rain: Sodom allusions in verse 6

Verse 6 turns up the heat, literally:

> “יַמְטֵר עַל־רְשָׁעִים פַּחִים; אֵשׁ וְגָפְרִית וְרוּחַ זִלְעָפוֹת מְנַת כּוֹסָם.”  
> “He will rain down upon the wicked snares;  
> fire and sulfur and a scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.”

Two clusters:

- **The rain catalog:**  
  – *יַמְטֵר* – “He will rain (down)”  
  – *אֵשׁ וְגָפְרִית* – “fire and sulfur”  
  – *רוּחַ זִלְעָפוֹת* – “a scorching/burning wind.”

This is a deliberate callback to **Sodom and Gomorrah**:

> “וַיהוָה הִמְטִיר עַל־סְדֹם וְעַל־עֲמֹרָה גָּפְרִית וָאֵשׁ”  
> “And the LORD rained on Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire” (Gen 19:24).

Usually rain is life in the land of Israel. Turning rain into fire and sulfur is like running creation in reverse—**anti‑rain.** The “scorching wind” (*רוּחַ זִלְעָפוֹת*) probably evokes the kind of desert wind that can wither crops and choke people.

- **The cup:**  
  “מְנַת כּוֹסָם” – “the portion of their cup.” In biblical poetry, your **cup** (*כּוֹס*) is your assigned lot or destiny. Compare:

  > “יְהוָה מְנָת חֶלְקִי וְכוֹסִי” – “The LORD is my portion and my cup” (Ps 16:5).  
  > “כִּי כוֹס בְּיַד־יְהוָה… אַךְ שְׁמָרֶיהָ יִמְצּוּ יִשְׁתּוּ כָּל־רִשְׁעֵי־אָרֶץ”  
  > “For there is a cup in the LORD’s hand… its dregs all the wicked of the earth shall drink” (Ps 75:9).

So in verse 6 God assigns to the violent what they have actually been “ordering” by their life: a cup full of the same burning chaos they spread.

### Ending not with escape, but with vision: “the upright shall behold His face”

The psalm ends with a compact three‑part statement:

> “כִּי־צַדִּיק יְהוָה; צְדָקוֹת אָהֵב; יָשָׁר יֶחֱזוּ פָנֵימוֹ.”  
> “For the LORD is righteous;  
> He loves righteous deeds;  
> the upright shall behold His face.” (v. 7)

- First line: **who God is.** “צַדִּיק יְהוָה” – “The LORD is righteous.” That’s the fundamental axiom that answers the v. 3 despair about “foundations.” Whatever else may be shaking, the ultimate foundation—God’s own character—is not.

- Second line: **what God loves.** “צְדָקוֹת אָהֵב” – “He loves *צְדָקוֹת*.” The plural likely means “acts of righteousness,” not just the idea of righteousness. God loves *embodied* justice—concrete choices, not only pious thoughts.

- Third line: **the promise.** “יָשָׁר יֶחֱזוּ פָנֵימוֹ” – literally, “the upright will behold His face.” That’s bold, since in Exodus 33:20 God says, “לֹא יוּכַל הָאָדָם לִרְאֹתִי וָחָי” – “No human can see Me and live.”

How to square that circle?

Classical options:

- **Cultic/relational:** “See God’s face” as a standard way to speak about enjoying God’s favor and presence, especially in the Temple. Compare Psalm 17:15: “אֲנִי בְצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ” – “I, in righteousness, will behold Your face.”
- **Future/eschatological:** Some read it as looking beyond this life to a fuller encounter with God.
- **Poetic:** The psalm has already played with sight language—God’s eyes see us (v. 4), and now the direction reverses: **mutual seeing**. Refuge (v. 1) grows into relationship (v. 7).

Either way, the psalm ends not with “and I’ll be safe in a cave somewhere,” but with **I will see God.** That’s the ultimate answer to “what can the righteous do?”—they can remain upright under God’s gaze, trusting that the last word will be *His*.

---LITURGICAL-SECTION-START---

#### Phrases

Even though Psalm 11 is not recited as a complete unit in the standard daily or festival services, several of its phrases have found a second life in Jewish liturgy. If you’ve ever sat in a sukkah on Sukkot or heard special piyyutim (liturgical poems) on fast days, you may already have been praying bits of this psalm without realizing it.

##### “יַמְטֵר עַל־רְשָׁעִים פַּחִים” – “He will rain snares upon the wicked” (11:6)

This phrase appears in personal prayers said inside the **sukkah** on Sukkot, often together with the *Ushpizin* custom (welcoming the “guest” souls of the ancestors). One popular text asks God to protect those sitting in the fragile hut:

> “וְלַחֲסוֹת מִזֶּרֶם וּמִמָּטָר,  
> כִּי תַמְטִיר עַל רְשָׁעִים פַּחִים.”  

“and to take shelter from the storm and from the rain,  
for You rain snares upon the wicked.”

Here the sukkah’s leaky roof is reimagined as **protection from a different kind of rain**—the “anti‑rain” of judgment from Psalm 11. The verse’s terrifying image becomes comforting: may that destructive rain fall only on the truly wicked, not on us.

##### “כִּי־צַדִּיק יְהוָה צְדָקוֹת אָהֵב” – “For the LORD is righteous; He loves righteous deeds” (11:7)

In some **Sephardic** rites this line appears in a Purim *krovetz* (a cycle of poems added to the repetition of the Amidah). One stanza about Esther says:

> “כְּבוּדָה בַת־מֶלֶךְ הִשְׁלִיכָה יַהַב,  
> כִּי צַדִּיק יְהוָה צְדָקוֹת אָהֵב,  
> כָּמַס דּוֹב רִשְׁפֵי לַהַב…”

“Glorious daughter of the king, she cast her burden [on God],  
for the LORD is righteous; He loves righteous deeds;  
like a bear He consumed flaming coals…”

The psalm’s general statement about God’s love of righteousness is now read **through Esther’s courage**: her deed is one of the *צְדָקוֹת* God loves.

##### “וְרוּחַ זִלְעָפוֹת” – “and a scorching wind” (11:6)

This phrase is reused in *Selichot* (penitential prayers) for the fast of the **Tenth of Tevet** in some Edot HaMizrach (Eastern) communities. A poem describing God’s anger at Jerusalem’s sins declares:

> “דִּבַּרְתִּי בְּאֵשׁ קִנְאָתִי בֵּית מְרִי לִסְפּוֹת,  
> הִנְנִי אֵלֶיהָ בְּאַף וְרוּחַ זִלְעָפוֹת.”

“I have spoken in the fire of My jealousy to consume the rebellious house;  
behold, I come against her in anger and in a scorching wind.”

Here “scorching wind” conveys both physical ruin and burning divine jealousy, extending Psalm 11’s storm‑of‑judgment imagery to the destruction of the Temple.

## REVISED VERSE COMMENTARY

---

### Verse 1

**לַמְנַצֵּחַ לְדָוִד; בַּיהוָה חָסִיתִי; אֵיךְ תֹּאמְרוּ לְנַפְשִׁי: נ֝וּדִי הַרְכֶם צִפּוֹר.**

“**For the leader. Of David.**  
In the LORD I have taken refuge;  
how can you say to me:  
‘Flee to your mountain, bird!’”

The opening superscription, **“לַמְנַצֵּחַ לְדָוִד”**, tags this as a Davidic psalm “for the conductor/choirmaster,” i.e., meant for public performance.

The first real line is already a punch: **“בַּיהוָה חָסִיתִי” – “In the LORD I have taken refuge.”** The verb חָסִיתִי (root חסה) is a perfect form, suggesting a **completed decision**: “I have taken shelter and I’m staying there.” In many psalms, this verb hints at temple‑asylum: think of someone grabbing the “horns of the altar” (1 Kgs 1:50) to avoid being killed. So this isn’t abstract spirituality; it’s as concrete as hiding in a church during a riot.

Immediately that stance is challenged: **“אֵיךְ תֹּאמְרוּ לְנַפְשִׁי” – “How can you say to my soul…?”** The “you” is plural. It could be friends, advisers, or (as Radak suggests) enemies pretending to give advice. The phrase “לְנַפְשִׁי” literally means “to my *nefesh*.” In biblical Hebrew, *nefesh* is your life/self, often grammatically feminine. That helps explain the next word.

We hit a famous **ketiv/qere** issue here. *Ketiv/qere* means “what is written / what is read” when the medieval Masoretes preserved two traditions:

- **Ketiv (written):** נוּדוּ – “flee, all of you” (plural imperative).  
- **Qere (read aloud):** נוּדִי – “flee!” (feminine singular imperative), as if speaking directly to the *nefesh*.

Most printed Bibles follow the **qere**, which fits well: “How can you say to my soul: ‘Flee (you, my soul) to your mountain, bird!’” Radak nicely combines them: the written form hints that both body and soul are in danger; the read form highlights the soul as the inner decision‑maker.

The simile “**צִפּוֹר** – bird” is a bit mocking. The advisers are basically saying, “You’re like a little bird—defenseless prey—so just fly away.” In other psalms, the isolated bird image marks deep vulnerability: “כְּצִפּוֹר בּוֹדֵד עַל־גָּג” – “like a lone bird on a roof” (Ps 102:8).

Traditional commentators often anchor this in David’s life. Meiri imagines the moment after David saved the people of **Ke’ila** (1 Sam 23), only to learn they planned to hand him over to Saul. No wonder some voices said, “רוץ להר”—“just run to the hills.”

But the psalmist’s first line already signaled his refusal: he is not going to let fear—or even very rational-sounding counsel—override the fact that his **real** refuge is not the geography of Judah but the presence of God.

---

### Verse 2

**כִּי הִנֵּה הָרְשָׁעִים יִדְרְכוּן קֶשֶׁת; כּוֹנְנוּ חִצָּם עַל־יֶתֶר; לִירוֹת בְּמוֹ־אֹפֶל לְיִשְׁרֵי־לֵב.**

“For see, the wicked bend the bow;  
they have set their arrow on the string,  
to shoot in the dark at the upright of heart.”

This verse is the advisers’ **evidence** for why flight is the only sane option. It’s a vivid archery scene.

“**כִּי הִנֵּה…**” – “For look!”—a classic Hebrew way to say “Face the facts.” Then three verbs:

1. **יִדְרְכוּן קֶשֶׁת** – “they bend the bow.” The root דרך here is the *technical* verb for treading down a stiff bow with your foot to string it.
2. **כּוֹנְנוּ חִצָּם עַל־יֶתֶר** – “they have set their arrow on the string.” *כּוֹנְנוּ* (from כון) suggests *careful positioning*. The “יֶתֶר” is the bowstring.
3. **לִירוֹת** – “to shoot.”

You can almost hear the twang.

The threat is intensified by location: **“בְּמוֹ־אֹפֶל” – “in deep darkness.”** The little form *בְּמוֹ* is a poetic variant of *בְּ* (“in”), giving a slightly weightier feel. *אֹפֶל* is not just “night” but thick gloom; the same word can describe the underworld or a place of danger.

The targets are “**לְיִשְׁרֵי־לֵב** – the upright of heart.” This phrase shows up a handful of times in Psalms (7:11; 32:11; 64:11; 94:15; 97:11). It stresses inner alignment: *yashar* = straight, *lev* = mind/heart as decision center. Psalm 7:11 calls God “מושׁיע יִשְׁרֵי־לֵב” – “savior of the upright of heart,” which almost answers Psalm 11:2 in advance.

There’s a strong echo here with **Psalm 64**, where enemies:

> “דָּרְכוּ חִצָּם דָּבָר מָר; לִירֹת בַּמִּסְתָּרִים תָּם”  
> “aim their arrows—bitter words—to shoot from ambush at the blameless” (Ps 64:4–5).

In both psalms, wicked people use the **cover of darkness or secrecy** as their main weapon, and the righteous are described with “straightness” language (*תם*, *ישרי־לב*).

So verse 2 is not exaggeration; it’s a **type‑scene** of persecution in the psalter. The advisers are saying: this is that situation. The wicked have already drawn the bow. You’re outgunned and outmaneuvered. Don’t be stupid—run.

The psalmist, however, will argue that darkness only hides things from *other humans*. From God’s point of view (v. 4), nothing is “off‑camera.”

---

### Verse 3

**כִּי הַשָּׁתוֹת יֵהָרֵסוּן; צַדִּיק מַה־פָּעָל.**

“For when the foundations are destroyed,  
what can the righteous do?”

This line is the **emotional peak** of the advisers’ speech. It’s what all the archery talk is building toward.

We’ve already noted that **“הַשָּׁתוֹת”** probably means “foundations,” from שׁית (“to set, place”). It’s a rare word; the main other candidate is Isaiah 19:10, where *שתותיה* may refer to the economic or social “foundations” of Egypt being smashed.

So what “foundations” might the advisers have in mind?

- On a **cosmic** level: the God‑built structures that make a moral world possible.
- On a **social** level: the people and institutions meant to uphold justice—priests, wise judges, reliable allies.
- On a very **specific** level (Rashi/Metzudat David): the priests of Nov, or other “tzaddikim, יסודי עולם – righteous ones, foundations of the world,” who have just been killed.

Meiri, thinking of David at Ke’ila, paraphrases: “You’ve saved these people, and now they repay you by betraying you. If even your ‘foundations’—those who should have your back—turn against you, what’s left?”

Then comes the question: **“צַדִּיק מַה־פָּעָל”**.

Hebrew students naturally want to parse the grammar, and here it’s actually meaningful:

- *צַדִּיק* – could be “a righteous person,” or “the righteous one” (maybe David himself, maybe God).
- *מַה־פָּעָל* – literally “what he has done,” but as you know the perfect can also be used in rhetorical questions as “what can he do?”

Commentators split:

- Rashi: David is defending himself—“I, the righteous one, what have I done? You (Doeg, Saul, etc.) will bear the guilt, not I.”
- Many modern readers: this is existential despair—“When the structures of justice are gone, righteousness doesn’t matter; the righteous is **powerless**.”

The psalm itself treats the line as a **genuine dilemma.** It doesn’t give a human‑strategy answer (no “organize, resist, build new institutions”). Instead, it responds by changing the frame: you’ve been thinking only about what righteous people can do down here; let’s look at what the **righteous God** is doing from above (vv. 4–7).

---

### Verse 4

**יְהוָה בְּהֵיכַל קׇדְשׁוֹ; יְהוָה בַּשָּׁמַיִם כִּסְאוֹ; עֵינָיו יֶחֱזוּ; עַפְעַפָּיו יִבְחֲנוּ בְּנֵי אָדָם.**

“The LORD is in His holy temple;  
the LORD—His throne is in heaven.  
His eyes behold; His eyelids test human beings.”

This is the **turning point** of the psalm. Instead of answering “what can the righteous do?”, the poet asserts **where God is and what God is doing.**

The double phrase “בְּהֵיכַל קׇדְשׁוֹ / בַּשָּׁמַיִם כִּסְאוֹ” plays on temple theology:

- *הֵיכַל קׇדְשׁוֹ* – “His holy palace/temple.” In many psalms this points to the earthly temple in Jerusalem.
- *בַּשָּׁמַיִם כִּסְאוֹ* – “in the heavens is His throne.”

Ibn Ezra flattens them together: “His holy temple *is* the heavens.” Others, like Radak, are happy to keep a tension: God really does have His throne “up there,” yet His presence is also focused “down here” in the temple. In ancient Near Eastern thought, temples were **cosmic junction points**—miniature heavens planted on earth.

In any case, God is not hiding in the mountains or pacing the palace, nervous. The very verbs used of the wicked’s plotting (“they bend…they set…they shoot”) are now matched by verbs of God’s **calm, searching gaze**:

- “עֵינָיו יֶחֱזוּ” – “His eyes *behold*.” The verb חזה is stronger than just “see”: it can mean “see with insight,” as prophets *ḥōzeh* “seers.”
- “עַפְעַפָּיו יִבְחֲנוּ” – “His eyelids *test*.”  

  The noun “עַפְעַפַּיִם” (eyelids) appears only in poetry. Here it contributes a striking picture: God squints, as it were, to scrutinize closely. The verb *בָּחַן* (“to test, examine”) is the one used for refining metals (e.g., “וּבְחַנְתִּים כִּבְחֹן הַזָּהָב” – “I will test them as one tests gold,” Zech 13:9).

So in place of **“darkness”** in v. 2, we get God’s forensic spotlight. The wicked think no one will see: “מִי יִרְאֶה־לָּמוֹ?” – “Who will see us?” (Ps 64:6). Psalm 11’s answer is: **God will. Always.**

There’s also a nice inclusio with the end of the psalm. Here, God’s eyes behold people; in verse 7, **“יָשָׁר יֶחֱזוּ פָנֵימוֹ” – “the upright will behold His face.”** The final mutual gaze is already foreshadowed here.

---

### Verse 5

**יְהוָה צַדִּיק יִבְחָן; וְרָשָׁע וְאֹהֵב חָמָס שָׂנְאָה נַפְשׁוֹ.**

“The LORD tests the righteous;  
but the wicked and the lover of violence His soul hates.”

This verse applies verse 4’s “testing gaze” to two different human types.

First half: **“יְהוָה צַדִּיק יִבְחָן.”**

- You can read it as “The LORD **[who is] righteous** tests [people],” or “The LORD **tests the righteous [person].**”
- In either case, the key verb is again *יִבְחָן*—the metallurgist’s verb. God tries the righteous as a smith tries gold.

Rashi’s flax‑worker parable is worth savoring, because it captures a very human question: why do good people suffer? He imagines God saying:

> When the flax worker knows his flax is good, he beats it more; if it’s poor quality, he barely hits it, or it falls apart. So too, God “beats” the righteous with tests because He knows they can endure and become something stronger.

Metzudat David is very clear: David’s being chased by Saul is **not** a sign of guilt—“מַה שֶׁאֲנִי נִרְדָּף מִשָּׁאוּל לֹא הוּא בַּעֲבוּר הָעָוֹן”—it is simply God’s way of refining him.

Second half: **“וְרָשָׁע וְאֹהֵב חָמָס שָׂנְאָה נַפְשׁוֹ.”**

The grammar is compressed: literally, “and the wicked and lover of violence—His soul hates.” The subject of “hates” is God; “נַפְשׁוֹ” is an anthropomorphic way to talk about God’s inner being, His deepest will and desire.

Why such strong language?

- **“רָשָׁע”** on its own could mean someone who does wrong.  
- Adding **“וְאֹהֵב חָמָס”** turns it into a character portrait: this person *loves* violence, exploitation, crooked dealing.

*חָמָס* is the word used to describe the pre‑Flood earth: “וַתִּמָּלֵא הָאָרֶץ חָמָס” – “the earth was filled with violence” (Gen 6:11). It often appears in prophets complaining about injustice (Hab 1:2–3).

So the verse draws a sharp line:

- The **righteous** are tested, like strong flax or precious metal, and eventually vindicated.  
- The **violence‑lover** is fundamentally incompatible with the righteous God. God’s very “soul” (speaking metaphorically) rejects them.

This sharp contrast prepares for the storm imagery of v. 6, which shows what that hatred of violence looks like in historical time.

### Verse 6

**יַמְטֵר עַל־רְשָׁעִים פַּחִים; אֵשׁ וְגָפְרִית; וְרוּחַ זִלְעָפוֹת מְנַת כּוֹסָם.**

“He will rain down upon the wicked snares;  
fire and sulfur;  
and a scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.”

This is one of those Old-Testament-is-metal moments.

The main verb **יַמְטֵר** (Hifil of מטר) usually describes God blessing the land with rain. Here God “rains” something very different:

- **פַּחִים** – a tricky word. In most places *פַּח* is a “snare, bird‑trap” (Ps 124:7). Rashi, however, reads it here as *פֶּחָמִים* (“coals, charcoal”), and Ibn Ezra connects it with “רִקֻּעֵי פַחִים” (Num 17:3), hammered metal plates, “like burning stones.” Either way, it contributes to the sense of **deadly stuff falling from the sky**.
- **אֵשׁ וְגָפְרִית** – “fire and sulfur” is straight out of the Sodom story (Gen 19:24). *גָּפְרִית* (sulfur) appears only a handful of times, always in contexts of **total destruction**.
- **רוּחַ זִלְעָפוֹת** – the noun *זַלְעָפָה* is rare; in Lam 5:10 it describes “זַלְעֲפוֹת רָעָב” – the “burning heat of famine.” The phrase here is likely “a scorching, raging wind,” maybe alluding to the hot desert wind (like a sirocco) that can ruin crops and health.

So we get a nightmare weather report: **booby‑trapped hailstones, fire‑sulfur storm, killer wind.**

The last phrase, **“מְנַת כּוֹסָם” – “the portion of their cup,”** zooms back to metaphor. Your *מָנָה* is your allotted share, your *כּוֹס* is your life‑cup—your fate, in biblical idiom. Psalm 75:9 pictures a cup of divine judgment in God’s hand that the wicked must drink “עַד דְּרָעִים”—“down to the dregs.”

Put together: what the “lover of violence” (v. 5) has been pouring out on others comes back to them as their own cup to drink.

Notice too the contrast with the **righteous person’s cup** in other psalms:

- “יְהוָה מְנָת־חֶלְקִי וְכוֹסִי” – “The LORD is my portion and my cup” (Ps 16:5).  
- “כּוֹס־יְשׁוּעוֹת אֶשָּׂא” – “I raise the cup of salvations” (Ps 116:13).

Psalm 11 holds both possibilities side by side: refuge (v. 1) and storm‑cup (v. 6). Which cup you drink is determined by whether you are a *צַדִּיק* or an *אֹהֵב חָמָס*.

### Verse 7

**כִּי־צַדִּיק יְהוָה; צְדָקוֹת אָהֵב; יָשָׁר יֶחֱזוּ פָנֵימוֹ.**

“For the LORD is righteous;  
He loves righteous deeds;  
the upright shall behold His face.”

This final verse is like a compressed theological summary of the whole psalm.

1. **“כִּי־צַדִּיק יְהוָה” – “For the LORD is righteous.”**  

   The “כִּי” here gives a reason: why will the storm fall on the guilty and not on the righteous? Because God **Himself** is *צַדִּיק*. Deut 32:4 says something similar in a longer form: “צַדִּיק וְיָשָׁר הוּא” – “He is righteous and upright.”

2. **“צְדָקוֹת אָהֵב” – “He loves *צְדָקוֹת*.”**  

   The plural *צְדָקוֹת* is probably not just an abstract plural (“great righteousness”) but **concrete acts**: just judgments, fair dealings, defending the oppressed. Radak reads it as “אִישׁ צְדָקוֹת” – “a man of righteous deeds.” The idea isn’t just that God is just in Himself, but that He **takes delight** when humans practice justice.

   This quietly corrects an easy mistake: thinking that trust in God = passivity. The psalm has said the righteous person doesn’t need a clever escape plan, but verse 7 insists the righteous person still **does things**—*צְדָקוֹת*—and God loves that.

3. **“יָשָׁר יֶחֱזוּ פָנֵימוֹ” – “the upright shall behold His face.”**  

   The subject “יָשָׁר” can be read as collective: “the upright [ones].” The verb *יֶחֱזוּ* repeats the same root חזה used of God’s eyes in v. 4. There, God’s eyes “behold” (*יֶחֱזוּ*) humanity; here, the upright “behold” (*יֶחֱזוּ*) God’s face. It’s a **reciprocal vision**.

   How literal is this? Given Exodus 33:20’s “no human can see My face and live,” most traditional readers take it metaphorically:

   - **Radak** relates it to Lev 26:9, “וּפָנִיתִי אֲלֵיכֶם” – “I will turn My face toward you,” i.e., show favor, hear prayer.
   - Others (and many modern readers) see a hint of **ultimate** encounter—that whatever “testing” and waiting happen now, the end is an unclouded, intimate knowledge of God.

Either way, it’s important that the psalm ends here, not at verse 6. The last word is not sulfur but **seeing**. The movement from verse 1 (“I take refuge in the LORD”) to verse 7 (“the upright will behold His face”) traces the arc from **hiding with God** to **meeting God**.

The advisers asked, “When the foundations crumble, what can a righteous person do?” Psalm 11’s answer is subtle: the righteous person doesn’t win by superior tactics; they endure under the gaze of the righteous God, keep doing righteous deeds, and are finally rewarded not just with safety, but with **face‑to‑face nearness** to the One who has seen them all along.
