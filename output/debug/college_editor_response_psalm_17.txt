### EDITORIAL ASSESSMENT

The existing introduction and commentary show real depth: they know the Hebrew well, use BDB and concordances intelligently, and make excellent big-picture points (especially the contrast between v.14 and v.15, the “eye” imagery, and the chiastic structure with v.7 at the center). The discussion of *אִישׁוֹן בַּת־עָיִן* and *בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ* is particularly strong, as is the explanation of *תְּמוּנָה* in v.15.

However, for a first-year college audience, the draft is much too dense and jargon-heavy. Terms like “forensic rhetoric,” “Sitz im Leben,” “hiphil,” “chiastic,” and “eschatological” either go undefined or are defined only implicitly. Sentences are long and sometimes read like a journal article. The tone occasionally slips into breathless praise (“audacity,” “monumental text”), which tells the reader something is impressive instead of *showing* it.

Several missed opportunities:

- More explicit use of the “related psalms” data (e.g., Ps 142:6 “חֶלְקִי בְּאֶרֶץ הַחַיִּים” as a foil to Ps 17:14).
- Fuller integration of Torah Temimah and rabbinic midrash (e.g., Bava Batra 10a on 17:15; Berakhot 5 on 17:14).
- A clearer, student-friendly walk-through of v.14’s options (wicked prosperity vs. God’s provision for the righteous).
- The liturgical section is informative but not well structured for beginners; it needs headings, shorter units, more explanation of what Birkat Kohanim, Selichot, etc. actually *are*.

The verse-by-verse commentary is rich but uneven: some verses get extensive treatment, others are barely started (v.15 cuts off). The style leans heavily academic, assumes familiarity with medieval commentators, and often drops technical observations (e.g., “hiphil of פלא”) without pausing to explain.

The revision should:

- Keep the best insights but translate them into clear, conversational prose.
- Define every technical term on first use.
- Use more concrete examples and cross-references with quoted Hebrew.
- Structure both the introduction and liturgical section with clear headings.
- Make the through-line of the psalm—two competing ideas of “satisfaction”—very explicit.

## REVISED INTRODUCTION

### 1. What kind of psalm is this?

Psalm 17 opens like someone pounding on the door of a courtroom, not like a quiet “Dear Diary” prayer:

> תְּפִלָּ֗ה לְדָוִד; **שִׁמְעָ֤ה יְהוָה ׀ צֶדֶק**  
> A prayer of David. **Hear, O LORD, [what is] right**…

The speaker fires off three imperatives in a row:

- **שִׁמְעָה** (*shimʿah*) – “hear”
- **הַקְשִׁיבָה** (*haqshivah*) – “pay close attention”
- **הַאֲזִינָה** (*ha’azinah*) – “give ear”

That repetition at the start of successive lines is called **anaphora**—a rhetorical technique where you hammer the same opening word to build urgency.

Even more striking: he doesn’t say, “Hear *me*,” but “Hear **צֶדֶק** (*tzedek*, ‘justice, what is right’).” He claims that his case and “Justice” itself are on the same side. This psalm is a **legal complaint**—a “prayer of the accused” who insists he’s innocent and asks God, as the ultimate judge, to overrule human courts.

Verse 2 makes that explicit:

> **מִלְּפָנֶיךָ מִשְׁפָּטִי יֵצֵא; עֵינֶיךָ תֶּחֱזֶינָה מֵישָׁרִים.**  
> “From Your presence let my judgment go forth; may Your eyes behold what is right.”

Here **מִשְׁפָּט** (*mishpat*, “judgment, verdict”) is the court decision, and “Your eyes” are God’s power to see the truth of a situation. The whole psalm lives in that courtroom atmosphere: testing evidence, cross‑examining motives, and finally announcing a verdict.

### 2. The story under the poem

The superscription says “A prayer of David” (*תְּפִלָּה לְדָוִד*). We can’t prove which episode in David’s life this goes with, but the details fit nicely with the “fugitive David” stories in 1 Samuel 23–26:

- He is **surrounded** (*יַקִּיפוּ עָלַי*, v.9; *סְבָבֻנוּ*, v.11).
- His enemies are **hunting** him like a lion waiting in ambush (v.12).
- He insists he did **not** take “the paths of the violent” (*אֹרְחוֹת פָּרִיץ*, v.4)—which sounds a lot like David refusing to assassinate Saul when he had the chance (1 Sam 24, 26).

So one way to “hear” the psalm is: David, hiding in caves, saying, “I played by Your rules. I didn’t take shortcuts. Now I’m boxed in by people who did. You, God, are my last court of appeal.”

Whether or not you buy that historical setting, it captures the emotional situation: someone who really has tried to do the right thing, and now feels that doing the right thing is going to get him killed.

### 3. The shape of the poem: a mirror with wings in the middle

Biblical poets often arrange ideas in **chiastic** patterns—a fancy word (from the Greek letter Chi, X) for a mirror structure like A–B–C–B′–A′. The central element (C) is usually the heart of the poem.

Psalm 17 looks like this:

- **A (vv.1–2)** – “Hear my just cause; let my verdict come from You.”
- **B (vv.3–5)** – “You’ve tested me; I’ve avoided violent paths; my feet haven’t slipped.”
- **C (vv.6–9)** – “Show Your *ḥesed*—Your covenant love—in a wondrous way; guard me as the apple of Your eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings.”
- **B′ (vv.10–12)** – “They’ve hardened themselves; their mouth speaks arrogance; he’s like a lion eager to tear.”
- **A′ (vv.13–15)** – “Arise, LORD… deliver me from the wicked… As for me, in righteousness I shall behold Your face.”

So the poem moves like this:

> Courtroom appeal → “My integrity” → **Center: Your protective love** → “Their violence” → Courtroom verdict.

The center (vv.6–9) shifts the whole tone from legal argument to intimacy: **eye**, **wings**, **shadow**, **hiding**. The psalmist doesn’t just want a favorable ruling; he wants to be so close to God that hurting him would be like poking God in the pupil.

### 4. Competing ideas of “the good life”

The sharpest contrast comes at the end between **v.14** and **v.15**. Verse 14 describes a certain kind of person:

> **מִמְתִים מֵחֶלֶד, חֶלְקָם בַּחַיִּים; וּצְפוּנְךָ תְּמַלֵּא בִטְנָם; יִשְׂבְּעוּ בָנִים וְהִנִּיחוּ יִתְרָם לְעוֹלְלֵיהֶם.**  
> “From mortals, from those of the fleeting world, whose **portion** is in this life.  
> With Your (hidden) treasure You fill their belly.  
> They are **satisfied** with children, and leave their surplus to their little ones.”

Key words:

- **חֶלֶד** (*cheled*) – a rare word for the “world” as a **short lifespan**, a fleeting world.
- **חֵלֶק** (*cheleq*, “portion, share”) – what you get handed as your lot.
- **יִשְׂבְּעוּ** (*yisbeʿu*, “they are satisfied, full”) – from the root *שׂבע*, to be filled or sated.

These people get exactly what most ancient Israelites (and, honestly, most of us) would call success: full stomachs, lots of kids, enough wealth to leave the grandkids an inheritance. If you stopped reading at v.14, you might assume *they* are the blessed ones.

But verse 15 begins with a strong contrastive **אֲנִי** (*ani*, “As for me”):

> **אֲנִי בְּצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ; אֶשְׂבְּעָה בְהָקִיץ תְּמוּנָתֶךָ.**  
> “But as for me, in righteousness I shall behold Your face;  
> I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Your likeness.”

Same satisfaction verb—*אֶשְׂבְּעָה* (*esbeʿah*, “I shall be satisfied”)—but a completely different object:

- **They** are sated with **belly** and **children**.
- **He** will be sated with **God’s face** and **likeness**.

That’s the psalm’s big “value argument.” There are two ways to define the “good life”: one measured by what goes into your stomach and down your family tree, the other measured by how close you come to seeing God.

### 5. Seeing and being seen

Notice how much eyesight language there is:

- God’s **eyes** see what is right: “**עֵינֶיךָ תֶּחֱזֶינָה מֵישָׁרִים** – Your eyes will behold what is upright” (v.2).
- The psalmist asks: “Guard me **as the apple of the eye**”—**כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת־עָיִן** (v.8).  
  *אִישׁוֹן* (*ishon*) is the “little man”—the tiny reflection you see in someone’s pupil. *בַּת־עַיִן* (*bat‑ayin*, “daughter of the eye”) is another idiom for the pupil. To be someone’s *ishon bat‑ayin* is to be exactly at the center of their gaze, the most protected spot on the body.
- The enemies’ **eyes** scan the ground, looking for traps to set: “**עֵינֵיהֶם יָשִׁיתוּ לִנְטוֹת בָּאָרֶץ** – Their eyes they set to spread out upon the land” (v.11).
- The climax: “**אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ** – I shall behold Your face” (v.15).

There’s some theological tension here. Elsewhere God says to Moses, “You cannot see My face, for no human can see Me and live” (Exod 33:20). Yet Numbers 12:8 says of Moses, “he beholds the **form** (*תְּמוּנָה*, *temunah*) of the LORD.” Our psalm dares to ask for something Moses‑like: “I will be satisfied with **Your temunah**” (v.15).

The phrase “when I awake” (*בְּהָקִיץ*, *b’hakitz*) appears again in Daniel 12:2: “Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall **awake** (*יָקִיצוּ*, *yakitzu*), some to everlasting life…” That’s why many Jewish commentators, like Rashi and Radak, read Psalm 17:15 as a hint of **resurrection**: after the “sleep” of death, the righteous will wake to see God.

Others, like Ibn Ezra, read it more philosophically: waking from the “sleep” of foolishness into a life of knowing God. Either way, the psalm’s end goal is not just not-dying—it’s *seeing*.

### 6. How later readers used this psalm

Jewish tradition leaned hard into the eschatological (“end of days”) reading. Rashi glosses, “I will be satisfied with the vision of Your likeness when the dead awaken from their sleep.” The verse is quoted in the Talmud (Bava Batra 10a): “A person who gives a coin to a poor man merits to receive the **face of the Shekhinah**,” and then our verse is brought: **אֲנִי בְּצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ**.

In synagogue liturgy, Psalm 17 shows up especially on days that feel like court: Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah. Sephardic communities recite the whole psalm on Yom Kippur morning; individual verses like “Guard me as the apple of the eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings” (v.8) and “As for me, in righteousness I shall behold Your face” (v.15) are woven into the daily priestly blessing (*Birkat Kohanim*).

Christian readers, especially Church Fathers like Augustine, saw Psalm 17 as the voice of Christ and as a key text for the **Beatific Vision**—the idea that ultimate human happiness is seeing God “face to face.”

For you, as a reader of biblical poetry, Psalm 17 is a brilliant workshop in how a relatively short poem can do all of this at once: stage a legal drama, sketch predators and wings and pupils, and then quietly end with one of the most daring sentences in the whole Bible.

---LITURGICAL-SECTION-START---

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

#### Full psalm

In the **Edot HaMizrach** (Middle Eastern) tradition, Psalm 17 is recited in full during the expanded **Pesukei DeZimra** (introductory psalms of praise) on **Yom Kippur morning (Shacharit)**. There it functions as a communal “prayer of the accused” on the Day of Judgment: the entire congregation adopts David’s language—“**שִׁמְעָה יְהוָה צֶדֶק** – Hear, O LORD, what is right” (17:1)—as they ask for a favorable verdict.

Some Eastern rites also weave Psalm 17 into the **Selichot** (penitential prayers) on Yom Kippur eve, using vv.1–3 to set a tone of honest self‑examination: God has “tested my heart… visited [me] at night” (17:3).

#### Key verses

1. **17:1 – שִׁמְעָה יְהוָה צֶדֶק הַקְשִׁיבָה רִנָּתִי**  
   “Hear, O LORD, [what is] right; give heed to my cry”

   - In **Ashkenazic Yom Kippur** liturgy, this line appears inside piyyutim (liturgical poems) during the **Chazzan’s Repetition** of the Amidah, strengthening the community’s plea that God listen to their case.
   - Sephardic Selichot before Rosh Hashanah use it in a call‑and‑response:  
     > **שְׁמַע יְהוָה קוֹלֵנוּ… שִׁמְעָה יְהוָה צֶדֶק הַקְשִׁיבָה רִנָּתֵנוּ**  
     > “Hear, O LORD, our voice… Hear, O LORD, what is right; give heed to our cry.”

2. **17:8 – שָׁמְרֵנִי כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת־עָיִן; בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנִי**  
   “Guard me as the apple of the eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings”

   - In many **Sephardic communities**, this whole verse is recited by the congregation during **Birkat Kohanim** (the priestly blessing). When the priests say “וְיִשְׁמְרֶךָ – and may He guard you,” the people answer:  
     > **שָׁמְרֵנִי כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת עָיִן, בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנִי.**  
   - The same verse appears in the **Seudah Reviʿit** (the “fourth meal” after Shabbat) in Eastern rites:  
     > **בְּכֹחַ סְגֻלָּתָהּ שָׁמְרֵנוּ כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת עָיִן, וּבְצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנוּ**  
     > “By the power of [Shabbat’s] special quality, guard us like the apple of the eye; hide us in the shadow of Your wings.”

3. **17:15 – אֲנִי בְּצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ…**  
   “As for me, in righteousness I shall behold Your face…”

   - In Sephardic **Birkat Kohanim**, when the priests say, “יָאֵר ה' פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ – May the LORD make His face shine upon you” (Num 6:25), the congregation responds:  
     > **אֲנִי בְּצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ; אֶשְׂבְּעָה בְהָקִיץ תְּמוּנָתֶךָ.**  
   - The piyyut **“Bar Yochai”**, sung especially on Lag BaOmer, ends one stanza with this phrase, applying it to Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai’s mystical insight.

#### Phrases

- **בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ – “in the shadow of Your wings” (17:8)**  
  This phrase reappears verbatim in Psalms 36:8, 57:2, and 63:8 and has migrated into many prayers. It becomes shorthand for God’s intimate protection—especially in times of transition, like the end of Shabbat and the Days of Awe.

- **נַפְשִׁי מֵרָשָׁע חַרְבֶּךָ – “my soul from the wicked, Your sword” (17:13)**  
  A variant of this line is woven into a special **El Maleh Rachamim** memorial prayer on the fast of 20 Sivan (for the 1648 massacres), turning David’s plea for rescue into a communal cry for justice for martyrs.

## REVISED VERSE-BY-VERSE COMMENTARY

---

### Verse 1

**תְּפִלָּ֗ה לְדָוִד; שִׁמְעָ֤ה יְהוָה ׀ צֶדֶק; הַקְשִׁ֥יבָה רִנָּתִי; הַאֲזִינָה תְּפִלָּתִי; בְּלֹא שִׂפְתֵי מִרְמָה.**

“A prayer of David. Hear, O LORD, [what is] right; give heed to my cry; give ear to my prayer, [spoken] without deceitful lips.”

The superscription **תְּפִלָּה לְדָוִד** (“a prayer of David”) is rare—only five psalms are labeled “tefillah.” It already signals that this is less “song” and more urgent appeal.

Then comes the triple imperative: **שִׁמְעָה… הַקְשִׁיבָה… הַאֲזִינָה**. All three mean “listen,” but with slightly different flavors:

- **שָׁמַע** (*shamaʿ*) is the basic “hear.”
- **הִקְשִׁיב** (*hiqshiv*) is “pay careful attention.”
- **הֶאֱזִין** (*he’ezin*) pictures someone literally cupping their ear.

Starting three successive clauses this way is **anaphora**—repeating a word at the beginning of lines for effect. It makes the verse sound like pounding: “Listen. Listen! Really listen!”

The object of the first verb is just **צֶדֶק** (*tzedek*, “justice, what is right”). Not “Hear *me*,” but “Hear **justice**.” The speaker identifies himself so strongly with a just cause that he can tell God, “Listen to *Justice* itself.” That’s bold.

The last clause, **בְּלֹא שִׂפְתֵי מִרְמָה** – “without lips of deceit,” is the first moral credential. The noun **מִרְמָה** (*mirmah*) is trickery or fraud. He’s saying, “I’m not buttering You up. What I say matches what I am.” That matches the book of Proverbs where deceitful lips are the mark of fools and villains (e.g. Prov 12:22).

There’s a nice echo with Psalm 12, which complains:

> **שָׁוְא יְדַבְּרוּ אִישׁ אֶת־רֵעֵהוּ; שְׂפַת חֲלָקוֹת, בְּלֵב וָלֵב יְדַבֵּרוּ.**  
> “They speak falsehood each to his neighbor; with smooth lips and a double heart they speak” (Ps 12:3).

Psalm 17 opens by saying, “I am *not* like that voice in Psalm 12. No double heart, no smooth lies.” On Yom Kippur, when this verse is quoted in prayers, that non-hypocritical speech is exactly what the community is aiming for.

---

### Verse 2

**מִלְּפָנֶיךָ מִשְׁפָּטִי יֵצֵא; עֵינֶיךָ תֶּחֱזֶינָה מֵישָׁרִים.**

“From before You let my judgment come forth; may Your eyes behold what is upright.”

**מִשְׁפָּטִי** (*mishpati*) is “my judgment” in the legal sense—my case, my verdict. The verb **יֵצֵא** (*yetze’*, “go out”) is court language: the judge’s decision “goes out” as an official pronouncement. So he’s saying, “Let my acquittal be issued *from You*, not from any crooked human court.”

The phrase **מִלְּפָנֶיךָ** (*millefanekha*) literally means “from before Your face,” where **פָּנִים** (*panim*, “face”) is a standard Hebrew way to say “presence.” To “stand before someone’s face” is to be in their presence; to have a verdict “go out from before Your face” is to have God Himself act as judge.

Then the metaphor shifts from hearing to seeing: **עֵינֶיךָ תֶּחֱזֶינָה מֵישָׁרִים** – “may Your eyes behold *meisharim*.” **מֵישָׁרִים** (from ישר, “straight”) means “straightness, uprightness, equity.” BDB (the Brown‑Driver‑Briggs lexicon) glosses it as “evenness, equity.” Think of a straight, level path as opposed to a twisted one.

So the speaker is confident that if God looks at the full situation, from above, he’ll see that the “straightness” is with the psalmist and not with his accusers.

This eye‑imagery sets up later contrasts: God’s eyes see *meisharim* (v.2); the enemies’ eyes scan the ground, looking for ways to trip him up (v.11). In Rosh Hashanah piyyutim (poems), this half‑verse is quoted in the middle of the Kedushah with a plea: **“עֵינֶֽיךָ תֶּחֱזֶֽינָה מֵישָׁרִים” – “may Your eyes behold what is right”**—asking God to see the straightness in Israel’s deeds despite everything else.

---

### Verse 3

**בָּחַנְתָּ לִבִּי; פָּקַדְתָּ לַּיְלָה; צְרַפְתַּנִי בַל־תִּמְצָא; זַמֹּתִי בַל־יַעֲבֹר־פִּי.**

“You have tested my heart; You have visited [me] by night; You have refined me—you will find nothing. I have resolved: my mouth will not transgress.”

Three different verbs describe God’s examination:

- **בָּחַן** (*bachan*, “test, assay”) is used of testing metal for purity.
- **פָּקַד** (*paqad*, “visit, inspect, take account of”) can mean anything from “visit graciously” (Gen 21:1) to “muster troops” (Num 1). Here it’s more like a surprise inspection.
- **צָרַף** (*tsaraf*, “smelt, refine”) is the hot stage: the silver in the furnace, the dross burned off.

And when does this happen? **לַּיְלָה**—“at night.” Night is when pretenses fall, when you’re alone with your thoughts. Some scholars have suggested a temple practice where a worshiper literally slept in the sanctuary and expected a dream or oracle in the night; whether or not that was a regular ritual, the image works: God looking into you when you’re off your guard.

The triple **בַל** (“not, by no means”)—*בַל־תִּמְצָא… בַל־יַעֲבֹר*—is strong poetic negation: “You will not find [anything],” “It will not pass.” He admits he makes *resolutions* (**זַמֹּתִי**, from זמם, “plan, scheme”) but says those schemes do not “cross his mouth” in evil speech.

Rashi and other medievals connect this to the David‑Bathsheba story: God “visited him by night” in that sin, tested him, and David later repented. Others, like Malbim, see it as a more general claim: even at night, when people entertain fantasies they’d never say out loud, his inner and outer self line up.

The Talmud picks up this verse when talking about tests like the Akedah (binding of Isaac). The idea is: God’s testing isn’t arbitrary; it reveals what’s already there, the way fire reveals if metal is truly gold or just shiny junk.

---

### Verse 4

**לִפְעֻלּוֹת אָדָם; בִּדְבַר שְׂפָתֶיךָ; אֲנִי שָׁמַרְתִּי; אֹרְחוֹת פָּרִיץ.**

“As for human actions—[it is] by the word of Your lips [that] I have kept myself from the paths of the violent.”

This verse is famously knotty in Hebrew. Literally: “For the deeds of man, by the word of Your lips, I have guarded paths of violent man.” That sounds like “I have guarded (i.e., *followed*) the violent man’s paths,” which makes no sense in context.

Most traditional and modern interpreters understand an implied “*from*”:

- **לִפְעֻלּוֹת אָדָם** – “with regard to human actions”
- **בִּדְבַר שְׂפָתֶיךָ** – “by the word of Your lips” = by Your commands and teachings
- **אֲנִי שָׁמַרְתִּי אֹרְחוֹת פָּרִיץ** – “I have kept [myself] from the paths of the violent.”

**פָּרִיץ** (*paritz*) is a “violent, lawless one,” a brigand; BDB glosses it as “robber, bandit.” His **אֹרַח** (*orach*) is his “way, path, lifestyle.” So the psalmist is claiming: “In all the messy world of ‘human actions,’ Your speech has been my standard, and it has kept me off the bandit path.”

This fits nicely with 1 Samuel 24 and 26, where David refuses to assassinate Saul even when urged to. That would have been the obvious “path of the violent”—a political shortcut. David says instead: “The LORD forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, the LORD’s anointed” (1 Sam 24:7). Here in the psalm, he could be summarizing that choice: “I obeyed **the word of Your lips** instead of my men’s advice.”

There is a minority reading (Radak mentions it) that takes the line almost confessionally: “I *did* walk in the ways of the violent,” making the psalm more penitential. But the immediate context—vv.3–5 stressing innocence—strongly supports the “I have *avoided* that path” reading.

Either way, the main point is the contrast between **“the doings of man”** and **“the word of Your lips.”** Human common sense and divine instruction are not always the same. The psalmist claims he chose the latter.

---

### Verse 5

**תָּמֹךְ אֲשֻׁרַי בְּמַעְגְּלוֹתֶיךָ; בַּל־נָמֹטּוּ פְעָמָי.**

“My steps have held fast to Your tracks; my feet have not slipped.”

The word **אֲשֻׁרַי** (*ashurai*) means “my steps” or “my footsteps.” **מַעְגְּלוֹתֶיךָ** (*maʿg’lotekha*) are “Your tracks” or “circles”—from a root meaning “to roll, make a groove.” A **מַעְגָּל** is the kind of rut a wagon wheel cuts into the road. So the picture is: God has well‑worn tracks, and the psalmist’s feet are firmly set into those grooves.

The verb **תָּמֹךְ** (*tamokh*) can be read two ways:

- As a **past statement**: “My steps *held fast* in Your paths.”
- As a **request**: “Hold firm my steps in Your paths!”

Hebrew sometimes uses this “infinitive in place of imperative” trick, so it’s ambiguous on purpose. It’s both a claim (“I have walked steadily”) and a prayer (“please keep me that way”).

The second line, **בַּל־נָמֹטּוּ פְעָמָי**, uses the root **מוּט** (*mut*, “to totter, slip”). “My feet have not slipped.” This image—feet that don’t slip—as a metaphor for moral faithfulness shows up all over Psalms: “He will not let your foot slip” (**אַל־יִתֵּן לַמּוֹט רַגְלֶךָ**, Ps 121:3).

Malbim, a 19th‑century commentator, gets very creative here. He distinguishes between **אֹרַח** (*orach*, “straight path”) and **מַעְגָּל** (*maʿgal*, “roundabout path”). Sometimes, he says, the right thing is straightforward kindness and humility; other times, dealing with the wicked, you have to take the “roundabout” of toughness or stern justice. In those complicated situations, you especially need God to “support your steps” so that you don’t veer off into cruelty or cowardice.

For a modern reader, that’s actually quite relatable: it’s easier to be good when the path is straight. It’s much harder when you have to pick the least bad option. The psalmist is asking for steady feet on both kinds of paths.

---

### Verse 6

**אֲנִי־קְרָאתִיךָ כִּי־תַעֲנֵנִי אֵל; הַט־אׇזְנְךָ לִי; שְׁמַע אִמְרָתִי.**

“I call upon You, for You will answer me, O God; incline Your ear to me; hear my word.”

The little word **כִּי** (*ki*) here means “because.” “I call to You *because* You will answer me.” This is a neat little confidence formula: the prayer is based on an expectation, not a wish. Rashi glosses: “כי בטוח אני שתענני – for I am confident that You will answer me.”

He calls God **אֵל** (*El*), one of the older Semitic names for “God,” emphasizing strength. The verb **הַט** (*hat*) in **הַט־אׇזְנְךָ** (*hat oznekha*) means “tilt, incline.” Picture someone leaning down to catch a child’s whisper. This idiom—“incline Your ear to me”—shows up a lot in laments (Ps 31:3, 71:2).

**שְׁמַע אִמְרָתִי** – “hear my *imrah*.” An **אִמְרָה** is not just any random muttering; it’s a formulated utterance, a deliberate word. In Psalm 12:7, **אִמְרוֹת יְהוָה** are “the words of the LORD,” described as pure silver. Here the psalmist is almost dignifying his own prayer: it’s not babble; it’s a carefully shaped argument.

Comparing with Psalm 22 is interesting. There the psalmist laments: **“אֱלֹהַי אֶקְרָא יוֹמָם וְלֹא תַעֲנֶה” – “My God, I call by day and You do not answer”** (Ps 22:3). Psalm 17 is the opposite emotional state: “I call… *because* You will answer.”

Together they show the range of biblical prayer: sometimes you experience God as responsive, sometimes as silent; both attitudes have language in the Psalms.

---

### Verse 7

**הַפְלֵה חֲסָדֶיךָ; מוֹשִׁיעַ חוֹסִים; מִמִּתְקוֹמְמִים בִּימִינֶךָ.**

“Make Your steadfast love wondrous, O Savior of those who take refuge, from those who rise up [against them], by Your right hand.”

The verb **הַפְלֵה** (*hafleh*) is from **פָּלָא / פָּלָה** (*palaʾ / palah*), “to be extraordinary, set apart, do wonders.” In Exodus 8:18, God says, **“וְהִפְלֵיתִי בַּיּוֹם הַהוּא אֶת אֶרֶץ גֹּשֶׁן” – “I will set apart that day the land of Goshen”**—make a visible distinction. So **הַפְלֵה חֲסָדֶיךָ** is like saying, “Make Your *ḥesed* stand out; do something unusually merciful.”

**חֶסֶד** (*ḥesed*) is one of the big covenant words: loyal love, committed kindness, the kind of love that doesn’t quit because there was a contract. The psalmist wants that love not just to exist abstractly but to show up publicly.

He calls God **מוֹשִׁיעַ חוֹסִים** (*moshiaʿ chosim*), “Savior of those who take refuge [in You].” The verb **חסה** (*chasah*) means to seek shelter, like an animal darting under a rock or a fugitive grabbing asylum at an altar. Psalm 2:12 ends, **“אַשְׁרֵי כָּל חוֹסֵי בוֹ – Happy are all who take refuge in Him.”**

The last phrase, **מִמִּתְקוֹמְמִים בִּימִינֶךָ**, is ambiguous:

- It can mean “from those who rise up [against them], [save] by Your right hand” (right hand = power).
- Or, as some commentators (like Ibn Ezra, Malbim) read, “from those who rise up *by Your right hand*,” i.e., who **claim** Your right hand is with them.

That second reading is psychologically sharp: think of enemies who say, “God is obviously on *our* side.” They rise up “in God’s name” and cloak their violence in piety. In that case, the psalmist asks God to “set apart” His ḥesed—show *publicly* who actually has His backing.

This verse appears in a Yehi Ratzon prayer said by some communities during the first twelve days of Nisan, sandwiched between other *ḥesed* verses (Ps 44:27, 33:22), as a plea that God’s covenant love distinguish Israel from the nations.

### Verse 8

**שׇׁמְרֵנִי כְּאִישׁוֹן בַּת־עָיִן; בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנִי.**

“Guard me like the apple of the eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings.”

Two unforgettable metaphors, one tiny, one huge.

First: **אִישׁוֹן בַּת־עָיִן** (*ishon bat‑ayin*).  
- *Ishon* is a diminutive of *ish* (“man”): “little man.” If you lean close to someone, you can see a tiny reflection of yourself in their pupil—that’s the “little man in the eye.”
- *Bat‑ayin* (“daughter of the eye”) is another idiom for the pupil.

So “Guard me like the *ishon bat‑ayin*” means: protect me the way a body protects its most delicate, essential organ. Deuteronomy 32:10 uses the same phrase of Israel: **“יִצְּרֶנְהוּ כְּאִישׁוֹן עֵינוֹ – He guarded him like the apple of His eye.”** Zechariah 2:8 ups the stakes: **“הַנֹּגֵעַ בָּכֶם נֹגֵעַ בְּבָבַת עֵינוֹ – whoever touches you touches the apple of His eye.”** Harm to Israel is like poking God in the eye.

Second: **בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ תַּסְתִּירֵנִי** – “Hide me in the shadow of Your wings.” **כְּנָפַיִם** (*k’nafayim*, “wings”) evoke both a mother bird and the **cherubim** over the Ark in the Temple, whose wings overshadow the mercy seat (Exod 25:20). **צֵל** (*tzel*) is “shadow,” and **סָתַר** (*satar*) is “hide, conceal.”

So this one line pulls together anatomy, nature, and temple architecture. The psalmist wants to be:

- The central reflection in God’s pupil (fully seen),
- And at the same time hidden under God’s wings (fully sheltered).

Malbim nicely distinguishes two threats: enemies who try to **blind** him—turn him from the path of light to darkness—and enemies who try to **kill** him. The “apple of the eye” prayer is for his inner clarity; the “shadow of wings” is for physical survival.

Liturgically, this verse is beloved. In Sephardic Birkat Kohanim, the people answer the priests’ “and may He guard you” with exactly this line. In the post‑Shabbat “fourth meal” in Eastern rites, it’s used to ask that the special protection of Shabbat extend into the week. The same words you see in this ancient poem are recited today as people stand under prayer shawls while the kohanim bless them—a living “shadow of wings.”

### Verse 9

**מִפְּנֵי רְשָׁעִים זוּ שַׁדּוּנִי; אֹיְבַי בְּנֶפֶשׁ יַקִּיפוּ עָלָי.**

“[Hide me] from the wicked who despoil me, from my deadly enemies who encircle me.”

We’re still syntactically connected to v.8: “Hide me in the shadow of Your wings **from**…” Now he names the threat.

**מִפְּנֵי רְשָׁעִים** (*mippenei reshaʿim*) – literally “from the face/presence of the wicked” = away from exposure to them.

Then comes the tricky **זוּ שַׁדּוּנִי**. The rare word **זוּ** (*zu*) can function like “who/that.” So most read: “the wicked **who** plunder me” (from **שָׁדַד**, *shadad*, “to ravage, despoil”). Radak glosses: “זו כעניין אשר – *zu* is like *asher*.”

**אֹיְבַי בְּנֶפֶשׁ יַקִּיפוּ עָלָי** – “my enemies, *with the soul*, encircle me.” The idiom **בְּנֶפֶשׁ** (*b’nefesh*) intensifies: “with [all] their soul,” “with murderous desire.” The verb **יַקִּיפוּ** (*yakifu*) is siege language—surround a city (cf. 2 Kings 6:14).

So the picture: enemies who passionately want his life, circling him like a shrinking ring. That makes v.8’s “shadow of wings” image feel even more urgent: he’s not asking for a general sense of peace; he’s asking for protection from a group closing in on him.

In a mystical Rosh Hashanah prayer attributed to the **Rashash** (a major 18th‑century kabbalist), the phrase **“בְּנֶפֶשׁ יַקִּיפוּ עָלֵינוּ”** is re‑applied to spiritual accusers in the heavenly court—forces that “encircle us with soul‑hunger” to prosecute us. The prayer asks God to “seal their mouths.” That’s a later theological move, but it shows how vivid this encirclement image became in the Jewish imagination.

### Verse 10

**חֶלְבָּמוֹ סָגְרוּ; פִּימוֹ דִּבְּרוּ בְגֵאוּת.**

“They have shut up their fat; with their mouth they speak in arrogance.”

Here we get a little anthropology lesson from the Hebrew world.

**חֵלֶב** (*chelev*) is “fat,” especially the rich fat around organs like the heart and kidneys. In sacrifices, that fat belongs to God (Lev 3:16); metaphorically, it can represent the inner core of a person. So **חֶלְבָּמוֹ סָגְרוּ** (*chelba­mo sagru*)—literally “their fat they have closed”—is weird to English ears but fits Hebrew physiology.

Most commentators hear it as “their inner parts (their heart) are closed off,” i.e., no compassion can get in. Rashi: “With their fat and richness they have closed their heart and eyes from looking at Your works.” Some moderns have suggested changing **חלבמו** (“their fat”) to **לבבם** (“their heart”), but all the manuscripts we have say “fat,” so it’s better to read it as an intentional metaphor.

The second clause, **פִּימוֹ דִּבְּרוּ בְגֵאוּת** – “their mouth speaks with pride,” fills out the picture. Internally they are **insensitive**; externally they are **arrogant**. The noun **גֵּאוּת** (*ge’ut*) is “pride, haughtiness.”

There’s a similar combination in Psalm 73:7:

> **יָצָא מֵחֵלֶב עֵינֵמוֹ; עָבְרוּ מַשְׂכִּיּוֹת לֵבָב.**  
> “Their eyes bulge from fat; the imaginations of their heart overflow.”

Fat there is linked with overindulgence and moral blindness. In Psalm 17, “closing the fat” is hardening the emotional core; the result is a proud, destructive tongue.

Notice the grammar quirk: **פִּימוֹ** (“his/its mouth,” singular) but **דִּבְּרוּ** (“they spoke,” plural). That’s a poetic way of saying that many individuals speak as one arrogant mouth—one collective party line.

### Verse 11

**אַשֻּׁרֵינוּ עַתָּה סְבָבֻנוּ; עֵינֵיהֶם יָשִׁיתוּ לִנְטוֹת בָּאָרֶץ.**

“Our steps—now they surround us; their eyes they set to spread out on the earth.”

Here the speaker suddenly shifts from “I” to “we”: **אַשֻּׁרֵינוּ** (*ashureinu*, “our steps”). The Masoretic text actually writes “they have surrounded *me*” (**סבבוני**, singular) but instructs us to read “they have surrounded *us*” (**סְבָבֻנוּ**, plural). The tradition is preserving both senses: David personally, and David plus his followers.

**עַתָּה** (*attah*, “now”) adds immediacy: “right now they’re circling.”

The second half, **עֵינֵיהֶם יָשִׁיתוּ לִנְטוֹת בָּאָרֶץ**, is a bit compressed. **יָשִׁיתוּ** (*yashitu*) is “they set/aim.” **לִנְטוֹת** (*lintot*) from **נָטָה**, can mean “to stretch out, to extend,” and **בָּאָרֶץ** = “on the earth/land.”

Most commentators understand: “They set their eyes [on our path], to stretch themselves out over the land”—like a net being laid, or troops spreading to encircle. Radak: “They set their eyes on our path, to spread their net in the land to capture us.”

So the enemies’ **eyes** here are the opposite of God’s eyes in v.2:

- God’s eyes “see the upright” (**תֶּחֱזֶינָה מֵישָׁרִים**).
- The enemies’ eyes “set themselves to bend the land” around the psalmist like a trap.

There are strong echoes here of other “net” psalms:

> **תּוֹצִיאֵנִי מֵרֶשֶׁת זוּ טָמְנוּ לִי… – “You bring me out of the net they hid for me”** (Ps 31:5).  
> **הוּא יוֹצִיא מֵרֶשֶׁת רַגְלָי – “He will bring my feet out of the net”** (Ps 25:15).

In fact, Psalm 31 and our psalm share several verbs: *yakifu/s’vavuni*, *palleteni*, *hat oznekha*. It’s as if Psalm 17 is the “legal brief” and Psalm 31 is the longer narrative of the same danger.

### Verse 12

**דִּמְיֹנוֹ כְּאַרְיֵה יִכְסֹף לִטְרֹף; וְכִכְפִיר יֹשֵׁב בְּמִסְתָּרִים.**

“His likeness is like a lion, eager to tear; like a young lion he sits in hiding places.”

After plural enemies, the poem zooms in on a single archetypal hunter: **דִּמְיֹנוֹ** (*dimyono*, “his likeness, his image,” from דמה, “to resemble”). The similes are explicit:

- **כְאַרְיֵה יִכְסֹף לִטְרֹף** – “like a lion yearning to tear prey.”
  - **יִכְסֹף** (*yikhsof*) from **כָּסַף**, to “long for, crave.” Same verb as in Gen 31:30, “You *longed* greatly for your father’s house.”
  - **לִטְרֹף** (*litrof*) from **טָרַף**, “to tear to pieces.”

- **וְכִכְפִיר יֹשֵׁב בְּמִסְתָּרִים** – “and like a *kefir* (young lion) sitting in hiding places.”
  - **כְּפִיר** is a lion in the prime of life.
  - **מִסְתָּרִים** (*mistarim*) are “hideouts” (from the same root as **תַּסְתִּירֵנִי**, “hide me,” back in v.8).

So the psalmist’s hiding under God’s wings (v.8) is mirrored—darkly—by the lion hiding in ambush.

Some traditional Jewish commentators (Radak, Malbim) say this “he” is Saul himself, with his army as the circling pack. Malbim even notes a “developmental” detail: a young lion lurks; a full lion goes out openly to hunt. He sees Saul as moving from secret attempts to kill David (throwing spears in the palace) to open military pursuit in the wilderness.

This lion imagery is a favorite enemy‑picture in Psalms:

- **“פֶּן־יִטְרֹף כְּאַרְיֵה נַפְשִׁי – lest he tear my soul like a lion”** (Ps 7:3).
- **“אַרְיֵה טֹרֵף וְשֹׁאֵג – a lion that tears and roars”** (Ps 22:14).

In the **Rosh Hashanah** shofar service in some Eastern rites, liturgy strings together our v.12 with vv.7–8: first describing the enemy‑lion, then immediately saying “Make wondrous Your ḥesed… Guard me as the apple of the eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings.” It’s threat‑and‑refuge back to back.

### Verse 13

**קוּמָה יְהוָה; קַדְּמָה פָנָיו הַכְרִיעֵהוּ; פַלְּטָה נַפְשִׁי מֵרָשָׁע חַרְבֶּךָ.**

“Arise, O LORD! Confront him, bring him down; rescue my life from the wicked—Your sword.”

Four short, punchy imperatives:

1. **קוּמָה** (*qumah*, “Arise!”) – the classic battle cry to wake the Divine Warrior (cf. Num 10:35: “Arise, LORD, and let Your enemies be scattered”).
2. **קַדְּמָה פָנָיו** (*qadmah panav*, “meet/confront his face”) – intercept him, head‑on. The root **קדם** can mean “go before, anticipate.”
3. **הַכְרִיעֵהוּ** (*hakhri’ehu*, “make him bow / bring him down”) – from כרע, “to kneel.” Make his knees buckle; neutralize him.
4. **פַלְּטָה נַפְשִׁי** (*palletah nafshi*, “rescue my soul/life”) – from פל״ט, to snatch out of danger (same root as in v.7, *moshiaʿ*).

Then the phrase **מֵרָשָׁע חַרְבֶּךָ**. Grammatically, this can be taken two ways:

- “from the wicked **[who is] Your sword**” – the wicked person as God’s instrument of judgment.
- “from the wicked; by **Your sword** [rescue me]” – God’s own sword as the means of deliverance.

Isaiah 10:5 uses similar imagery: **“הוֹי אַשּׁוּר שֵׁבֶט אַפִּי – Ah, Assyria, the *rod* of My anger”**. There, a cruel empire is explicitly called God’s tool. Radak reads our verse like that: the wicked one is a “sword” that God uses to punish those who deserve it—but the psalmist now asks God to sheath that sword in his case.

Rashi leans into this: “from every wicked one who is Your sword, whom You empower to exact retribution.” In other words: “I know my enemies only have power because You allowed it. Please now **take** that power back.”

The Torah Temimah (a 19th–20th‑century halakhic commentator) notes an echo of this verse when the Talmud tells the story of Rabbi Akiva’s martyrdom (Berakhot 61b). Akiva, being flayed alive by the Romans (“Your sword,” as it were), recites the Shema and says, “All my life I was troubled by the command ‘with all your soul—even if He takes your soul’; now that I have a chance, shall I not fulfill it?” In that story, the rescue of his *nefesh* is not from death but through death, into the vision of God—exactly where Psalm 17 will end.

### Verse 14

**מִמְתִים־יָדְךָ יְהוָה; מִמְתִים מֵחֶלֶד; חֶלְקָם בַּחַיִּים; וּצְפוּנְךָ תְּמַלֵּא בִטְנָם; יִשְׂבְּעוּ בָנִים; וְהִנִּיחוּ יִתְרָם לְעוֹלְלֵיהֶם.**

“From men, by Your hand, O LORD; from men of the fleeting world, whose portion is in this life. With Your hidden [things] You fill their belly; they are sated with children, and leave their surplus to their little ones.”

This verse is dense and debated.

The double **מִמְתִים** (*mimtim*, “from men”) underscores: “Deliver me from these *human* threats.” **יָדְךָ** (*yadkha*, “Your hand”) could link back to v.13—humans who are “Your sword” or “Your hand” of judgment. But the focus quickly shifts to describing **what kind of men** they are.

**מֵחֶלֶד** (*mecheled*) – from **חֶלֶד**, a rare noun. In Psalms 49:2 and 89:48 it clearly means “world” in the sense of this present, passing age. It probably comes from a root meaning “to be worn, to rust” (cf. modern Hebrew *chaludah* = rust). So: “men whose horizon is this short-lived world.”

**חֶלְקָם בַּחַיִּים** – “their **portion** is in life.” **חֵלֶק** (*cheleq*) is your allotment, share, inheritance. For the wicked, *all* their cheleq is here and now. That’s a sharp contrast to other psalms where God Himself is the portion of the righteous: **“יְהוָה מְנַת חֶלְקִי – The LORD is the portion of my lot”** (Ps 16:5); **“חֶלְקִי אֱלֹהִים לְעוֹלָם – God is… my portion forever”** (Ps 73:26).

Then: **וּצְפוּנְךָ תְּמַלֵּא בִטְנָם** – “Your hidden [things] You fill their belly.” **צָפוּן** (*tzafun*) is “hidden, stored up,” so it can mean “treasure.” The psalmist even grants: God is the one who has filled them with plenty! This is not necessarily a compliment. It’s more like: “Fine. Let them have their full plates.”

And what do they do with that? **יִשְׂבְּעוּ בָנִים** – “they are sated with children,” i.e., lots of offspring, and **וְהִנִּיחוּ יִתְרָם לְעוֹלְלֵיהֶם** – “they leave their surplus to their little ones” (grandchildren). In ancient Israel, having many children and enough wealth to leave an inheritance were prime signs of blessing.

So are these men wicked or righteous? The surrounding context (they’re “the wicked” of v.9, from whom he wants rescue) points to **wicked**. The psalmist looks at their success and says, essentially, “OK. They get full bellies and lots of kids. That’s their cheleq.”

Traditional commentators mostly agree that this is describing **materialist enemies**, not blessed friends. Radak sums it up: “Their portion is in the life of this world, for they do not look toward the world to come.”

The Torah Temimah notes a Talmudic play on **“וּצְפוּנְךָ תְּמַלֵּא בִטְנָם”**. In Berakhot 5b, the Gemara says if you place your bed north–south, you will merit sons, and uses our verse to support the idea that “Your hidden things You fill their belly; they shall be satisfied with sons.” That’s a classic example of how midrash can repurpose a verse homiletically while its plain sense in context is more ironic: these “men of cheled” got what they wanted; the psalmist wants something different.

### Verse 15

**אֲנִי בְּצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ; אֶשְׂבְּעָה בְהָקִיץ תְּמוּנָתֶךָ.**

“But as for me, in righteousness I shall behold Your face; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Your likeness.”

This is the theological mountaintop of the psalm.

The **אֲנִי** (*ani*) is emphatic—“*I*, on the other hand.” After describing “men of the fleeting world” whose portion is in this life, the psalmist draws a line: their cheleq vs. mine.

**בְּצֶדֶק** (*b’tzedek*) can mean “in righteousness,” “through righteousness,” or “as righteousness.” In any case, it ties back to v.1 (**שִׁמְעָה… צֶדֶק**) and frames the whole psalm. He began by asking God to hear *tzedek*; he ends by claiming that *in tzedek* he will see God’s face. His hoped‑for vision is not cheap; it is connected to the life of integrity he has just described.

The verb **אֶחֱזֶה** (*echezeh*) is from **חזה**, “to see,” often used for prophetic seeing (a **חָזוֹן** *chazon* is a “vision”). The object: **פָנֶיךָ** (*panekha*), “Your face.” That’s the same “face” that humans supposedly cannot see and live (Exod 33:20), yet Moses spoke with God “face to face” (**פָּנִים אֶל־פָּנִים**, Exod 33:11), and “beheld the *temunah* of the LORD” (Num 12:8).

Which brings us to the second line: **אֶשְׂבְּעָה בְהָקִיץ תְּמוּנָתֶךָ** – “I shall be satisfied when I awake, with Your *temunah* (form/likeness).”

We met **שׂבע** (*savaʿ*, “be satisfied”) back in v.14: “they are satisfied (*יִשְׂבְּעוּ*) with children.” Here it’s first‑person singular: *I* will be satisfied—with **You**.

**בְּהָקִיץ** (*b’hakitz*) – “when I awake.” The same root appears in Daniel 12:2 for the resurrection: **יָקִיצוּ** (*yakitzu*), “they will awake” from “the dust of the earth.” That’s why Rashi, Radak, and much of Jewish tradition read this as a hint of life after death: when the righteous “wake up” from the sleep of the grave, their true satisfaction will be seeing God’s likeness.

The word **תְּמוּנָה** (*temunah*) appears in the Ten Commandments: **“לֹא תַעֲשֶׂה לְךָ פֶסֶל וְכָל תְּמוּנָה” – “You shall not make for yourself an idol or any *likeness*”** (Exod 20:4), and also in Numbers 12:8: **“וּתְמֻנַת ה' יַבִּיט – He [Moses] beholds the *temunah* of the LORD.”** It doesn’t mean God has a physical shape; it’s your **way of perceiving** God’s self‑revelation.

Ibn Ezra, the rationalist, insists this is about an intellectual vision in this life: awakening from confusion into clear knowledge of God’s wise governance. But the rabbinic and liturgical tradition is quite comfortable hearing more: an ultimate, post‑death encounter. Hence Bava Batra 10a: “One who gives a coin to a poor person merits to welcome the Shekhinah (Divine Presence), as it is said: **אֲנִי בְּצֶדֶק אֶחֱזֶה פָנֶיךָ**.”

Either way, the psalm leaves us with a stunning claim: in the end, the only thing that can really fill a human is not land, kids, or wealth, but the experience—however you understand it—of “beholding God’s face.”

For someone just starting to read biblical poetry, that’s worth sitting with: the poem starts in a courtroom, surrounded by enemies, and ends with the speaker satisfied not by winning the lawsuit, but by the hope of seeing God.
