### EDITORIAL ASSESSMENT

The existing introduction and commentary have real strengths. They grasp the psalm’s basic architecture—the swing from universal indictment (vv. 1–3) to a focused picture of oppression (vv. 4–6) and then to a Zion-centered hope (v. 7). They rightly stress that “the fool” (נָבָל) is morally senseless rather than intellectually stupid, and they pay attention to some good lexical details, especially *hishḥîtu* (הִשְׁחִיתוּ) and *ne’elāḥu* (נֶאֱלָחוּ). The commentary also notes several genuine poetic features: the divine “zoom out” in v. 2, the inclusio with “אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב,” and the sound-play in “שָׁם פָּחֲדוּ פָחַד.”

At the same time, several weaknesses limit its usefulness for an intelligent lay reader. Stylistically, the prose leans on adjectives (“masterclass,” “brilliant”) instead of patiently demonstrating the poem’s craft. It is more schematic than telescopic: it describes structure but too rarely shows how a single word or metaphor reverberates through the whole psalm.

Substantively, some rich materials from the research bundle are underused. The Torah Temimah’s link between “אָמַר נָבָל בְּלִבּוֹ” and the warning “after your heart” in the Shema is never mentioned; rabbinic and medieval readings that locate the psalm in concrete historical crises (Nebuchadnezzar, Titus, Sennacherib) are cited only glancingly. The commentary notes Psalm 53 but does not really reflect on what it means to have two near-duplicates in the Psalter. Figurative language parallels—especially the “devouring” of God’s people—are asserted rather than shown through quoted examples (e.g., Micah 3:3, Deut. 7:16). The LXX expansion of v. 3 and its afterlife in Romans 3 are alluded to but not explained.

Poetic devices are unevenly treated. The sound of “שָׁם פָּחֲדוּ פָּחַד” is noted, but there is little on how the key metaphors—eating, refuge, restoring fortunes—behave elsewhere in the Bible and why they matter here. The liturgical section gestures at themes but does not quote prayers or show concretely how the psalm’s vocabulary has seeped into Jewish worship.

In revision, the introduction and verse notes need: fewer superlatives, more quoted Hebrew (biblical and liturgical), careful use of rabbinic and medieval commentary, fuller engagement with Psalm 53 and the LXX, and richer figurative-language comparison.

### REVISED INTRODUCTION

Psalm 14 is a small, sharp-edged poem whose opening line has had a long and noisy afterlife:  

> אָמַר נָבָל בְּלִבּוֹ  
> אֵין אֱלֹהִים.  
> “The benighted one has said in his heart,  
> ‘There is no God.’” (v. 1)

In modern ears this sounds like philosophical atheism. In biblical usage it is something narrower and, in a way, more unnerving: not denial of God’s existence but denial of God’s *relevance*. The *nāvāl*—literally the “churl,” the ignoble man—is the person who lives as though God neither governs nor judges.

Elsewhere, Deuteronomy rebukes Israel as “עַם נָבָל וְלֹא חָכָם” — “a foolish and unwise people” (Deut. 32:6), not because they are stupid but because they spurn the God who made and sustained them. Isaiah likewise contrasts the *nāvāl* with the noble: “לֹא יִקָּרֵא עוֹד לְנָבָל נָדִיב” — “The fool will no longer be called noble” (Isa. 32:5), and then defines him as one who “speaks folly” and “practices ungodliness” (32:6). In that register, the fool of Psalm 14 is not a village skeptic; he is the arrogant oppressor who imagines that “no one is watching.”

Rabbinic interpretation makes this explicit. The Torah Temimah, drawing on Berakhot 12b, notes that when the Shema warns, “וְלֹא תָתוּרוּ אַחֲרֵי לְבַבְכֶם” — “do not stray after your hearts” (Num. 15:39), the Sages gloss “after your hearts” as heresy, citing our verse: “אָמַר נָבָל בְּלִבּוֹ, אֵין אֱלֹהִים.” To follow one’s “heart,” in this sense, is to cultivate an interior monologue in which God is functionally absent.

From that interior sentence the psalmist widens the frame. The singular fool of v. 1 immediately becomes an unnamed “they”:

> הִשְׁחִיתוּ, הִתְעִיבוּ עֲלִילָה;  
> אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב. (v. 1b)  
>  
> “They have done ruin; they have made their deeds abominable;  
> there is none who does good.”

The verbs are heavy. *Hishḥîtū* (הִשְׁחִיתוּ) is the same root used of the pre-flood world, “וַתִּשָּׁחֵת הָאָרֶץ… כִּי הִשְׁחִית כָּל־בָּשָׂר” — “The earth was ruined… for all flesh had corrupted its way” (Gen. 6:11–12). *Hit’îvū* (הִתְעִיבוּ) is a verb of ritual and moral disgust: what is *to’evah*, abhorrent. BDB glosses this combination in our psalm as “make abominable, do abominably.”

Verse 2 then executes a cinematic cut. We move from the fool’s heart to a God’s‑eye view:

> יְהוָה מִשָּׁמַיִם הִשְׁקִיף עַל־בְּנֵי אָדָם;  
> לִרְאוֹת הֲיֵשׁ מַשְׂכִּיל, דֹּרֵשׁ אֶת־אֱלֹהִים.  

“YHWH looks down from heaven on human beings,  
to see whether there is one who acts wisely,  
one who seeks God.”

The verb הִשְׁקִיף (*hišqîf*) describes leaning out and looking down from a height, used when God “comes down” to inspect Babel (Gen. 11:5) or Sodom (Gen. 18:21). It is anthropomorphic, but its function is juridical: the deity investigates before judging. Here God is searching for a *maskîl* (מַשְׂכִּיל)—not a prodigy but someone who “has sense,” who lets understanding guide action—and, more precisely, one who “seeks God” (דֹּרֵשׁ אֶת־אֱלֹהִים).

The answer is devastating:

> הַכֹּל סָר, יַחְדָּו נֶאֱלָחוּ;  
> אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב, אֵין גַּם־אֶחָד. (v. 3)  

“All have turned aside; together they have become foul.  
There is none who does good, not even one.”

*Hakkol sār* — “the whole lot has swerved.” The rare verb *ne’elāḥu* (נֶאֱלָחוּ) probably carries the sense of milk that has gone sour; Job pairs its adjective with “abhorred” in describing corrupt humanity: “אַף כִּי־תֹעֵב וְנֶאֱלָח אִישׁ שֹׁתֶה כַמַּיִם עַוְלָה” — “How much more is a man abhorred and corrupt, who drinks iniquity like water!” (Job 15:16). The initial verdict “אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב” is repeated and intensified: “אֵין גַּם־אֶחָד — not even one.” The opening section is framed (an *inclusio*) by this absolute: “there is none who does good.”

Christian readers know these lines mainly through Paul’s catena in Romans 3, which quotes the Greek Psalm in its expanded form. The Septuagint of Psalm 14 (numbered 13 in Greek) imports additional phrases about open graves, venomous tongues, and feet swift to shed blood—phrases taken from other biblical texts. That expansion, already present in the LXX, let Paul string together a portrait of sin as a universal epidemic. The Hebrew psalm is terser, and sharper. It does not anatomize sin; it sketches its atmosphere.

Then, without warning, the canvas contracts from “all humanity” to a particular conflict:

> הֲלֹא יָדְעוּ כָּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן,  
> אֹכְלֵי עַמִּי אָכְלוּ לֶחֶם;  
> יְהוָה לֹא קָרָאוּ. (v. 4)  

“Do they not know, all the workers of mischief,  
who devour my people as they eat bread,  
who do not call upon YHWH?”

The metaphor tightens. The wicked are “*oḵlê ‘ammî*” (אֹכְלֵי עַמִּי), “those who eat my people.” Elsewhere, to “eat” someone is idiomatic for exploitation or conquest. Deuteronomy tells Israel, “וְאָכַלְתָּ אֶת־כָּל־הָעַמִּים” — “you shall consume all the peoples” (Deut. 7:16), and Micah gives a gruesome political cartoon of Judah’s leaders:

> אֲשֶׁר אָכְלוּ בְשַׂר עַמִּי,  
> וְעוֹרָם מֵעֲלֵיהֶם הִפְשִׁיטוּ… (Mic. 3:3)  

“Who eat the flesh of my people,  
and strip their skin from them…”

Our psalm does not linger on the gore, but the logic is the same: the powerful treat the weak as consumables.

Who speaks of “my people”? Medieval Jewish commentators answer in different registers. Rashi and the Meiri, reading the psalm as prophecy of Nebuchadnezzar or Titus, effectively hear God’s voice: “my people” are Israel under pagan boots. Radak and Metzudat David take a more generic view but still imagine the covenant community as the victim and the foreign empire as the devourer. Either way, the point is less ethnographic than theological: those who prey on “my people” also “do not call on YHWH.” They do not recognize a higher judge.

Verses 5–6 introduce a counter‑community:

> שָׁם פָּחֲדוּ פָחַד,  
> כִּי־אֱלֹהִים בְּדוֹר צַדִּיק.  
> עֲצַת עָנִי תָבִישׁוּ,  
> כִּי יְהוָה מַחְסֵהוּ.  

“There they were seized with terror,  
for God is with the generation of the righteous.  
The counsel of the poor you would shame,  
but YHWH is his refuge.”

The line “שָׁם פָּחֲדוּ פָחַד” has a palpable thump when read aloud; the doubled *pachad* (פָּחַד, “fear”) and the stresses — `**SHĀM** **PĀ**‑ḥa-dhū **FĀ**‑ḥadh` — mimic a heartbeat gone ragged. The precise “there” (*shām*) is unspecified, perhaps deliberately: wherever the wicked imagined themselves secure will turn out to be the place of panic once they discover that “God is in the generation of the righteous.”

Opposed to the eating oppressors are the *‘ānî* (עָנִי), the poor or afflicted, whose “counsel”—their decision to trust YHWH—is treated as laughable. Yet the psalm insists that “YHWH is his *maḥseh* (מַחְסֶה),” his shelter. This is a standard metaphor in the Psalms. “אֱלֹהִים לָנוּ מַחֲסֶה וָעֹז,” “God is for us a refuge and strength” (Ps. 46:2), and “יֹאמַר לַיהוָה מַחְסִּי וּמְצוּדָתִי,” “He says of YHWH, ‘My refuge and my fortress’” (Ps. 91:2). Here, too, the imagery is of physical cover against weather or assault, repurposed for divine protection.

The closing verse changes the poem’s temperature:

> מִי־יִתֵּן מִצִּיּוֹן יְשׁוּעַת יִשְׂרָאֵל;  
> בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה שְׁבוּת עַמּוֹ,  
> יָגֵל יַעֲקֹב, יִשְׂמַח יִשְׂרָאֵל. (v. 7)  

“O that deliverance for Israel might come from Zion!  
When YHWH restores the fortunes of his people,  
Jacob will exult, Israel will rejoice.”

The phrase “מִי־יִתֵּן” (*mi‑yitten*) literally means “who will give,” but in biblical idiom it is a wish formula: “If only…” (cf. Num. 11:29, “וּמִי־יִתֵּן כָּל־עַם יְהוָה נְבִיאִים” — “Would that all YHWH’s people were prophets!”). The universal lament collapses into a particular longing: salvation (*yeshu‘ah*) for Israel from Zion, the cultic and political center where God’s presence dwells. The technical phrase “שׁוּב… שְׁבוּת” (“restore the fortunes” or “bring back the captives”) recurs in exilic and post‑exilic texts: “וְשָׁב יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ אֶת־שְׁבוּתְךָ” — “YHWH your God will restore your fortunes” (Deut. 30:3); “וְשַׁבְתִּי אֶת־שְׁבוּת עַמִּי יִשְׂרָאֵל” — “I will restore the fortunes of my people Israel” (Amos 9:14). Our psalm locates its bleak anthropology, then, in a very specific historical hope: that a crushed community will be brought home and will laugh again.

Psalm 14 has a nearly verbatim twin, Psalm 53. The wording is virtually identical; the main differences are that Psalm 14 uses the personal name YHWH four times, while Psalm 53 consistently says “Elohim,” and that the final line there asks for “ישׁוּעוֹת יִשְׂרָאֵל” (“salvations,” plural, Ps. 53:7). Many scholars think Psalm 53 is a deliberate adaptation of our psalm for a different liturgical or historical setting—perhaps one less tightly bound to Zion. Medieval commentators like the Malbim already sensed this: he suggests Psalm 14 was composed for a particular deliverance in David’s life and later re‑used, with Elohistic tweaks, for the national miracle against Sennacherib.

However we date it, Psalm 14 holds together three perspectives that rarely coexist so compactly: a merciless pessimism about human justice, a fierce conviction that God sides with the poor, and a stubborn hope that this alignment will one day be visible “from Zion.” It begins in the fool’s heart and ends in the restored city.

  
---LITURGICAL-SECTION-START---

#### Full psalm

In the standard Ashkenazic and Sephardic rites Psalm 14 is not assigned a prominent, fixed place as a unit—unlike, say, Psalm 27 in Elul or Psalm 92 on Shabbat. It is occasionally recited in full as part of private supplication or the complete recitation of *Tehillim*, especially in times of communal distress, but this is a matter of custom rather than formal liturgy. Its influence in prayer comes more through its vocabulary and themes than through a set slot in the service.

#### Phrases

One of Psalm 14’s key phrases, “פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן” — “workers of iniquity” (v. 4), echoes strongly in Psalm 92, which *is* central to Shabbat liturgy. Psalm 92, recited as *Shir shel Yom* for Shabbat and often in *Pesukei de‑Zimra*, contrasts the short-lived flourishing of the wicked with divine justice:

> בִּפְרֹחַ רְשָׁעִים כְּמוֹ עֵשֶׂב,  
> וַיָּצִיצוּ כָּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן;  
> לְהִשָּׁמְדָם עֲדֵי־עַד. (Ps. 92:8)  
>  
> “When the wicked sprout like grass,  
> and all workers of iniquity blossom,  
> it is only that they may be destroyed forever.”

The Shabbat congregation thus weekly rehearses the conviction that the apparent success of “all workers of iniquity” is temporary. This is the same class of characters denounced in Psalm 14:4, “כָּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן, אֹכְלֵי עַמִּי” — “all workers of mischief, those who devour my people.” The liturgical reuse of the phrase places Psalm 14’s complaint into a broader rhythm of trust: whatever the present appetite of the devourers, “לְהִשָּׁמְדָם עֲדֵי־עַד” — “it is for their annihilation forever.”

A second thematic echo concerns the idiom “restore the fortunes” in v. 7: “בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה שְׁבוּת עַמּוֹ” — “when YHWH restores the fortunes of his people.” While Psalm 14 itself is not quoted, the noun שְׁבוּת (or שְׁבִית) and the verb שׁוּב underlie later biblical and liturgical language. Psalm 126, often sung before *Birkat ha‑Mazon* on Shabbat and festivals, begins:

> בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה אֶת שִׁיבַת צִיּוֹן,  
> הָיִינוּ כְּחֹלְמִים. (Ps. 126:1)  

“When YHWH restored the fortunes of Zion,  
we were like dreamers.”

The weekday *Amidah* also takes up the same hope in prose: “תְּקַע בְּשׁוֹפָר גָּדוֹל לְחֵרוּתֵנוּ… וְקַבְּצֵנוּ יַחַד מֵאַרְבַּע כַּנְפוֹת הָאָרֶץ” — “Sound the great shofar for our freedom… and gather us together from the four corners of the earth.” When we pray for the ingathering of exiles and the rebuilding of Jerusalem, we are effectively praying for what Psalm 14:7 envisions: a future moment when “יָגֵל יַעֲקֹב, יִשְׂמַח יִשְׂרָאֵל” — “Jacob will exult, Israel will rejoice.”

### REVISED VERSE COMMENTARY

**Verse 1**

לַמְנַצֵּחַ לְדָוִד;  
אָמַר נָבָל בְּלִבּוֹ, אֵין אֱלֹהִים;  
הִשְׁחִיתוּ, הִתְעִיבוּ עֲלִילָה;  
אֵין עֹשֶׂה־טוֹב.

The superscription, “לַמְנַצֵּחַ לְדָוִד” (“For the leader; of David”), ties the psalm to the Davidic collection and to temple performance. *Lamnatseach* probably designates the director of music; the poem is not just private reflection but public liturgy.

The opening declaration, “אָמַר נָבָל בְּלִבּוֹ, אֵין אֱלֹהִים” — “the *nāvāl* has said in his heart, ‘There is no God,’” is carefully staged. The speech is internal (“in his heart”), not proclaimed. The term נָבָל carries a specific moral weight. BDB defines it as “fool, senseless,” especially in a religious-ethical sense, with the “collateral idea of ignoble, disgraceful.” Isaiah 32:6 explains:

> כִּי נָבָל נְבָלָה יְדַבֵּר,  
> וְלִבּוֹ יַעֲשֶׂה אָוֶן…  

“For the fool speaks folly,  
and his heart works iniquity…”

Likewise Deuteronomy rebukes: “הֲ־לַיְהוָה תִּגְמְלוּ זֹאת, עַם נָבָל וְלֹא חָכָם” — “Is this how you repay YHWH, you foolish and unwise people?” (Deut. 32:6). Psalm 14’s *nāvāl* stands in that moral tradition: he is not gullibly stupid but willfully perverse.

“אֵין אֱלֹהִים” in this context means, more precisely, “there is no governing God here.” The same phrase recurs in Psalm 10:4:

> רָשָׁע כְּגֹבַהּ אַפּוֹ, בַּל יִדְרֹשׁ;  
> אֵין אֱלֹהִים, כָּל מְזִמּוֹתָיו.  

“The wicked, in the height of his anger, does not seek.  
‘There is no God’—so are all his schemes.”

There, the point is not metaphysical atheism but a practical conclusion: no one will call me to account.

Rabbinic tradition takes the line as the classic statement of heresy. Berakhot 12b, as cited by the Torah Temimah, comments on the tzitzit paragraph’s warning “לֹא תָתוּרוּ אַחֲרֵי לְבַבְכֶם” — “do not stray after your hearts,” that this refers to *minut* (sectarian belief), “as it is said, ‘אָמַר נָבָל בְּלִבּוֹ, אֵין אֱלֹהִים.’” The fool’s heart is not just a private space; it is the seedbed of behavior.

The psalm immediately shifts from the singular fool to a plural “they”: “הִשְׁחִיתוּ, הִתְעִיבוּ עֲלִילָה; אֵין עֹשֶׂה־טוֹב.” The pair of verbs intensifies the picture. *Hishḥîtū* (הִשְׁחִיתוּ) is the Hiphil form of שׁחת, used of active destruction (“he ruined, spoiled”). In Genesis 6 it describes a world so morally rotten that God must unmake it: “וַתִּשָּׁחֵת הָאָרֶץ לִפְנֵי הָאֱלֹהִים” — “the earth was corrupted before God” (Gen. 6:11). *Hit’îvū* (הִתְעִיבוּ) is the Hitpael of תָּעַב, “to make abominable.” In Job 9:31 it appears of being made an abomination through filth; in our psalm it governs עֲלִילָה (“deed, exploit”), suggesting deeds fit for the category *to‘evah*.

The climactic “אֵין עֹשֶׂה־טוֹב” (“there is none who does good”) universalizes what began as one person’s inner fantasy. It is also the phrase that will close the opening section in v. 3, forming an envelope around vv. 1–3. The rhetoric is hyperbolic—there are “righteous” and “poor” elsewhere in the psalm—but hyperbole is part of lament’s grammar: to cry out from injustice is to feel, for a moment, that goodness has vanished from the earth.

**Verse 2**

יְהוָה מִשָּׁמַיִם הִשְׁקִיף עַל־בְּנֵי אָדָם;  
לִרְאוֹת הֲיֵשׁ מַשְׂכִּיל, דֹּרֵשׁ אֶת־אֱלֹהִים.

The second verse stages a stark contrast between the fool’s inward whisper and God’s outward gaze. “יְהוָה מִשָּׁמַיִם הִשְׁקִיף” — “YHWH, from heaven, looked down.” The verb הִשְׁקִיף (*hišqîf*) is vivid: to lean out and look down from an elevated vantage point. It appears when Abraham “looks out” over the smoking plain (Gen. 19:28), when Balaam is brought to a hill that “overlooks” the wilderness (Num. 23:28), and, importantly, with God as subject: “וַיַּשְׁקֵף יְהוָה אֶל־מַחֲנֵה מִצְרַיִם” — “YHWH looked down upon the camp of the Egyptians” at the Red Sea (Ex. 14:24). The image is of judicial inspection: the heavenly king surveying his realm.

The object of this inspection is “בְּנֵי אָדָם” — literally “sons of Adam,” an intentionally generic label. He looks “לִרְאוֹת הֲיֵשׁ מַשְׂכִּיל” — “to see whether there is one who behaves wisely.” The participle מַשְׂכִּיל comes from שׂכל, a root meaning “to be prudent, to act circumspectly.” In Proverbs it marks the sensible actor: “עֶבֶד מַשְׂכִּיל יִמְשֹׁל בְּבֵן מֵבִישׁ” — “A prudent servant will rule over a disgraceful son” (Prov. 17:2). Wisdom here is not abstract intelligence but behavior grounded in reality.

The second term, “דֹּרֵשׁ אֶת־אֱלֹהִים,” defines the first: the one who is truly *maskîl* is the one who “seeks God.” To “seek” (דרשׁ) God is covenantal language: it involves inquiry, worship, and obedience. Chronicles tells of a time when “לֹא דֹרֵשׁ וְאֵין תּוֹרָה” — “there was no seeking and no teaching” (2 Chr. 15:3), as a shorthand for religious breakdown.

The structure of the verse is what literary critics call a “staircase parallelism” or “synthetic parallelism”: the second colon does not restate but completes the thought of the first. “YHWH looks down from heaven… to see whether there is *anyone* who acts wisely, *namely* one who seeks God.” The “A is so, and what’s more, B” dynamic is clear: the general category (wisdom) is filled with a specific content (seeking God).

In the context of v. 1, this verse answers the fool’s heart with a divine counter‑intention. The fool says in his heart “no God”; God, for his part, searches human hearts for anyone who will say “yes” by seeking Him. The tragedy, as v. 3 will reveal, is that this search appears fruitless.

**Verse 3**

הַכֹּל סָר; יַחְדָּו נֶאֱלָחוּ;  
אֵין עֹשֶׂה־טוֹב, אֵין גַּם־אֶחָד.

Here we hear God’s verdict on the search of v. 2. “הַכֹּל סָר” — “the whole [lot] has turned aside.” The verb סוּר (“to turn aside”) is often used morally: “סָרוּ מַהֵר מִן־הַדֶּרֶךְ” — “they have quickly turned aside from the way” (Ex. 32:8). Isaiah 53:6 uses the same image in a communal confession: “כֻּלָּנוּ כַּצֹּאן תָּעִינוּ, אִישׁ לְדַרְכּוֹ פָּנִינוּ” — “All we like sheep have gone astray; each has turned to his own way.”

“יַחְדָּו נֶאֱלָחוּ” is more obscure. The verb אָלַח occurs only here, in the parallel Psalm 53:4, and in Job 15:16 (as an adjective). Most lexicons take it to mean “become filthy, tainted.” Job’s “נֶאֱלָח” man “drinks iniquity like water” (Job 15:16). There, the pairing “נִתְעָב וְנֶאֱלָח” (“abhorred and corrupt”) suggests physical and moral rot. Psalm 14 borrows that flavor: the human community has gone rancid together.

The refrain “אֵין עֹשֶׂה־טוֹב, אֵין גַּם־אֶחָד” closes the inclusio begun in v. 1. The first clause repeats “there is none who does good”; the addition “אֵין גַּם־אֶחָד” (“not even one”) intensifies the negation. The effect is claustrophobic: between the two refrains, the whole human scene is enclosed in corruption.

Historically, Jewish interpreters have not read this as a denial that there are any righteous individuals; the psalm itself will speak of a “דור צדיק” (“generation of the righteous,” v. 5) and of the “עני” who trusts in YHWH (v. 6). Rather, the verse is heard as a vision of how things look when violence and injustice are ascendant—when the public order and its rulers are, in the main, bent away from God. The LXX’s expansion (incorporated into Romans 3) elaborates this into a comprehensive diagnosis, but the Hebrew poet is content with a grim generalization: as a body, humanity has veered off.

**Verse 4**

הֲלֹא יָדְעוּ כָּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן,  
אֹכְלֵי עַמִּי אָכְלוּ לֶחֶם;  
יְהוָה לֹא קָרָאוּ.

The psalm now breaks into direct, incredulous address. “הֲלֹא יָדְעוּ…?”—“Do they not know…?” The target is “כָּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן,” “all workers of trouble/iniquity.” The noun אָוֶן spans mischief, trouble, and moral evil (see Ps. 7:15; 10:7). In prophetic satire, Bethel, corrupted by idolatry, is renamed “בֵּית אָוֶן” — “house of iniquity” (Hos. 4:15).

These evil‑doers are further characterized as “אֹכְלֵי עַמִּי אָכְלוּ לֶחֶם” — “those who devour my people as they eat bread.” The particle “as” is implicit: the parallelism assumes it—devouring people with the same ease and thoughtlessness as eating a meal. As noted in the introduction, the Bible often uses “eating” as metaphor for exploitation or conquest. One sharp parallel is Micah 3:2–3, where leaders “אֲשֶׁר אֲכַלְתֶּם שְׁאֵרִי” — “you have eaten my flesh”—and “שְׁאַר עַמִּי יָאכֵלוּ” — “they eat the flesh of my people,” stripping skin and breaking bones. Deuteronomy 7:16 uses it of total military defeat.

The figurative pattern typically involves three elements: (1) a group with power, (2) a vulnerable group likened to food, and (3) an implied obliviousness or cruelty. Our psalm fits the mold: “workers of iniquity” eat “my people” and in so doing “do not call on YHWH.” They neither seek God (contrast v. 2) nor credit Him as the source of their gains.

Who is the “I” behind “my people”? Traditional Jewish readings often hear God. Rashi, reading the psalm about Nebuchadnezzar and his successors, glosses “אֹכְלֵי עַמִּי” as “the seed of Nebuchadnezzar,” devouring Israel. Radak generalizes: any nation that oppresses Israel is in effect eating God’s people. Others, including some modern scholars, allow that the psalmist—perhaps the king—speaks on God’s behalf: “my people” as the community with whom he identifies and for whom he prays.

The Torah Temimah notes an intriguing midrashic use of this verse in Sanhedrin 104b. There the Rabbis ask why, in the acrostic of Lamentations, the letter פ (peh, “mouth”) comes before ע (ayin, “eye”), unlike the normal order. They answer: because the spies “said with their mouths what their eyes had not seen,” citing among other verses “אֹכְלֵי עַמִּי אָכְלוּ לֶחֶם; יְהוָה לֹא קָרָאוּ.” The association is thematic rather than literal: in both cases, speech detached from truthful perception leads to communal disaster, and in both, God is left uncalled upon.

“יְהוָה לֹא קָרָאוּ” — “they have not called on YHWH” — closes the accusation. In biblical idiom, to “call on the name of YHWH” is to worship, to appeal to, and to depend upon Him (Gen. 4:26; Joel 3:5). The devourers’ eating and their godlessness are two sides of a single disposition: they treat the world as a field for their appetite, answerable to no one.

**Verse 5**

שָׁם פָּחֲדוּ פָחַד;  
כִּי־אֱלֹהִים בְּדוֹר צַדִּיק.

“שָׁם פָּחֲדוּ פָחַד” is compact and musical. Literally, “There they feared a fear.” The repetition of פ (p), ח (ḥ), and ד (d), with its double stress — `**SHĀM** **PĀ**‑ḥa-dhū **FĀ**‑ḥadh` — gives the line an almost onomatopoetic tremor, as if we were hearing the stutter of panic. The adverb “שָׁם” (“there”) is deliberately vague: where they once felt utterly secure, in that very “there” they will be seized by dread.

The Masoretic Text continues simply, “כִּי־אֱלֹהִים בְּדוֹר צַדִּיק” — “for God is in the generation of the righteous.” Psalm 53:6, the parallel, adds a phrase: “פַחַד לֹא־הָיָה פָחַד” — “a terror where there was no terror”—echoed in the LXX of our psalm. That expanded form underlies later quotations (e.g., in early Christian usage). The shorter Hebrew version we have preserves the underlying logic: the wicked’s fear is explained by the discovery that “God is with” (or “in”) the righteous generation they scorned.

Who are this “דור צדיק” (“generation of the righteous”)? Verse 6 will identify them with the “עני,” the poor who make YHWH their refuge. The phrase “generation” often marks a cohort whose defining trait is either wickedness or fidelity (cf. Ps. 12:8, “דור זוּ לֹא יָשִׁית לִבּוֹ,” “a generation that does not set its heart aright”). Here the righteous are a minority remnant, but God’s presence in their midst turns history’s balance.

Traditional commentators again historicize. Rashi, hearing the psalm speak of Belshazzar, points to Daniel 5:6, where the Babylonian king’s “קִטְרֵי חֲרַצֵּהּ מִשְׁתָּרִין” — “the joints of his loins were loosened” — when the writing appears on the wall. Meiri similarly sees in “שָׁם פָּחֲדוּ פָחַד” a hint of Belshazzar’s terror and of Nebuchadnezzar’s madness, “for God [was] in the generation of the righteous” — Daniel and his companions. The point of such readings is less to fix a date than to affirm a pattern: empires that devour God’s people eventually find themselves trembling.

Theologically, the verse offers the psalm’s first explicit note of reversal. Up to now we have seen only the confidence of the oppressors and the vulnerability of “my people.” Now the camera flashes forward to a time when those who denied God’s governance will be confronted, unexpectedly, with evidence that He has been siding with their victims all along.

**Verse 6**

עֲצַת־עָנִי תָבִישׁוּ;  
כִּי יְהוָה מַחְסֵהוּ.

The scene remains a confrontation, but now in direct second person: “עֲצַת־עָנִי תָבִישׁוּ” — “The counsel of the poor you shame.” The “poor” (*‘ānî*) in biblical poetry is not simply one with little money. The root ענה in its adjectival form often denotes the afflicted, the humble, those unable to defend themselves against abuse. Psalm 10:2–3 speaks of “בְּגַאֲוַת רָשָׁע יִדְלַק עָנִי” — “in the pride of the wicked the poor is hotly pursued.”

What is the poor person’s “counsel” (*‘atsah*)? Radak and Metzudat David see it as his basic plan for survival: to trust in God. In that light, the second colon is explanatory: “כִּי יְהוָה מַחְסֵהוּ” — “for YHWH is his refuge.” The very strategy the wicked mock—placing confidence not in military alliances, bribes, or flattery, but in divine protection—is the strategy the psalm endorses.

“מַחְסֶה” (*maḥseh*, “refuge”) is a central metaphor in the Psalms. Psalm 46:2 declares, “אֱלֹהִים לָנוּ מַחֲסֶה וָעֹז, עֶזְרָה בְצָרוֹת נִמְצָא מְאֹד” — “God is for us a refuge and strength, a help very readily found in trouble.” Psalm 61:4 has the psalmist ask, “תְּהִי לִי לְצוּר מָעוֹז… מָעוֹן מִשְׂגָּב מִפְּנֵי אוֹיֵב” — “Be to me a rock of refuge… a stronghold against the enemy.” The image is architectural: a shelter against storms or attackers. Here the metaphor is sharpened by contrast: what the poor have that the powerful lack is not resources but a hiding place “in” God.

Rashi paraphrases sharply: “You say that the counsel of Israel is shameful, because they trust in YHWH, for YHWH is his refuge.” That is, from the oppressor’s perspective, it is ridiculous to rely on an invisible deity when realpolitik demands tribute and arms. The psalm replies that in the long run, this “ridiculous” counsel will be vindicated when “there [the oppressors] fear a great fear” (v. 5).

Meiri hears behind the verse the voice of Jews in exile whose seventy-year hope for return (Jeremiah’s prophecy) seems still unfulfilled. Their enemies, he suggests, mocked their calculations and declared their trust in God to be baseless. Psalm 14 answers that such mockery misunderstands the story. The delay of visible help does not annul the reality that “YHWH is his refuge.”

The shift in pronouns is also worth noting. “You” (plural) addresses the oppressors; “his” (singular) in “מַחְסֵהוּ” points to the individual poor person. The psalm moves from macro-diagnosis (“all have turned aside”) to the micro-drama of one afflicted person’s trust, and how that trust looks from different vantage points.

**Verse 7**

מִי־יִתֵּן מִצִּיּוֹן, יְשׁוּעַת יִשְׂרָאֵל;  
בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה שְׁבוּת עַמּוֹ,  
יָגֵל יַעֲקֹב, יִשְׂמַח יִשְׂרָאֵל.

The final verse is both a sigh and a shout. It begins with the wish formula “מִי־יִתֵּן” — “O that…!” Literally, “Who will give… from Zion deliverance for Israel?” The idiom recurs in poignant places. Moses cries, “וּמִי־יִתֵּן כָּל־עַם יְהוָה נְבִיאִים” — “Would that all YHWH’s people were prophets” (Num. 11:29). Job exclaims, “מִי־יִתֵּן בִּשְׁאוֹל תַּצְפִנֵנִי” — “O that You would hide me in Sheol” (Job 14:13). The phrase signals deep desire rather than a request in formal prayer language.

The object of desire is “יְשׁוּעַת יִשְׂרָאֵל” — “the deliverance of Israel.” The verb ישׁע (“to save, deliver”) is the root behind the later name Yehoshua / Jesus; here it carries its straightforward sense of rescue from oppression. The source is “מִצִּיּוֹן” (“from Zion”), the mountain where the temple stands, emblematic of God’s earthly dwelling and Davidic kingship. Psalm 2 correlates kingship and Zion: “וַאֲנִי נָסַכְתִּי מַלְכִּי, עַל־צִיּוֹן הַר קָדְשִׁי” — “I have installed my king on Zion, my holy mountain” (Ps. 2:6). Our psalm answers the global diagnosis of vv. 1–3 not with a general moral improvement plan but with a specific hope: that God will act from Zion on behalf of His people.

“בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה שְׁבוּת עַמּוֹ” contains an idiom that deserves comment. The combination of שׁוּב (“return, restore”) with שְׁבוּת or שְׁבִית (“captivity, fortune”) means “to restore fortunes” or “to bring back captives.” BDB notes its use both for Israel and other nations. Deuteronomy 30:3 promises, “וְשָׁב יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ אֶת־שְׁבוּתְךָ” — “YHWH your God will restore your fortunes.” Amos 9:14 has, “וְשַׁבְתִּי אֶת־שְׁבוּת עַמִּי יִשְׂרָאֵל” — “I will restore the fortunes of My people Israel.” Psalm 126:1, beloved in liturgy, echoes: “בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה אֶת־שִׁיבַת צִיּוֹן, הָיִינוּ כְּחֹלְמִים” — “When YHWH restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like dreamers.”

In Psalm 14 the restoration is still future, framed by the wish “מִי־יִתֵּן.” When that restoration comes, says the psalm, “יָגֵל יַעֲקֹב, יִשְׂמַח יִשְׂרָאֵל.” The double name—Jacob/Israel—is characteristic of poetic parallelism and likely carries connotations of the nation in its vulnerability (Jacob) and in its covenant dignity (Israel). The verbs reinforce joy: *yāgēl* (יָגֵל) suggests spinning or exulting; *yismaḥ* (יִשְׂמַח) is “rejoice.”

Comparing Psalm 14:7 with its twin in Psalm 53:7 is instructive. There, the line reads: “מִי יִתֵּן מִצִּיּוֹן יְשׁוּעוֹת יִשְׂרָאֵל” — “O that from Zion salvations for Israel would come.” The plural “יְשׁוּעוֹת” (“deliverances”) may suggest repeated acts of rescue, or simply intensify the notion of salvation. Psalm 53 also has “בְּשׁוּב אֱלֹהִים שְׁבוּת עַמּוֹ” — “when Elohim restores the fortunes of his people,” instead of “בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה.” The shift from the personal name YHWH to the more generic “Elohim” is a hallmark of the so‑called Elohistic Psalter (Pss. 42–83), suggesting Psalm 53 is an adaptation of Psalm 14 for that collection.

Liturgically and theologically, this verse quietly pulls the psalm out of mere pessimism. If one read only vv. 1–3, the psalm might seem to affirm a near‑nihilistic view of humanity. Verses 4–6 complicate that by insisting on God’s solidarity with the afflicted. Verse 7 goes further by tying that solidarity to a concrete future: there will be a day when the poor’s mocked “counsel” will be vindicated, and when the community that now laments, “אֵין עֹשֶׂה־טוֹב,” will instead say, “הִגְדִּיל יְהוָה לַעֲשׂוֹת עִם־אֵלֶּה” — “YHWH has done great things for them” (Ps. 126:2).
