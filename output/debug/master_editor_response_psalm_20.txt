### EDITORIAL ASSESSMENT

The existing introduction and commentary on Psalm 20 are already quite strong. They rightly treat the psalm as a pre‑battle royal liturgy, track the movement from petition to assurance, and notice key structural features: the cascade of jussive verbs (“may he…”) in vv. 2–6, the pivot of “Now I know” in v. 7, the antithesis between chariots/horses and God’s name, and the threefold repetition of “answer” (vv. 2, 7, 10). The draft also makes good use of traditional commentators (especially Radak and Malbim), notes the spatial movement from earthly to heavenly sanctuary, and gestures toward the pairing with Psalm 33.

The main weaknesses are of three kinds:

1. **Accessibility and style.** The prose sometimes slides into specialist shorthand (“hypostatized agent,” “Deuteronomistic,” “prophetic perfect”) without explanation, and the grammatical metalanguage can feel like a seminar paper rather than an essay for the intelligent general reader. Some excellent insights are buried in dense paragraphs that could be clearer and more narratively shaped.

2. **Missed opportunities from the research bundle.**  
   - The intertextual relation with Psalm 33 is mentioned but not really developed with quoted Hebrew; that pairing is one of the richest payoffs in the data.  
   - Figurative language parallels (especially for “name,” “right hand,” “remember,” and the collapse/fall imagery in v. 9) are cited but not often *shown* through Hebrew quotations from elsewhere in the Bible.  
   - The liturgical material is underused: we hear that Psalm 20 is recited in Shacharit, but we are rarely shown how specific verses are woven into prayers, with Hebrew.

3. **Verse commentary gaps.**  
   - Some unusual words—יְדַשְּׁנֶה, נִדְגֹּל, וַנִּתְעוֹדָד—are well glossed lexically but not fully exploited poetically or theologically.  
   - The ambiguity of נַזְכִּיר (v. 8) is noted but could be connected more clearly to the cluster of זכר (“remember/mention”) verbs in the psalm and beyond.  
   - The question of who speaks “Now I know” in v. 7 is carefully posed, but the function of that voice in a concrete liturgical scene could be drawn more vividly.

The revision should therefore (1) keep the solid structural and theological insights, but rephrase them in clearer, more narrative prose; (2) quote more Hebrew (with translation) from parallel texts and from the liturgy; (3) answer several of the macro/micro questions that are in fact resolved by the bundle (e.g., the Psalm 33 pairing, the logic of sacrificial “remembering,” the right‑hand imagery) and integrate those answers into a smoother argument.

### REVISED INTRODUCTION

A king is about to march out to war. Before he goes, the people gather in the sanctuary to pray for him. That is the scene Psalm 20 invites us to imagine. It is not the king’s private meditation but a liturgy spoken *to* him and *about* him, likely in the Temple courtyard, with priests and singers leading the words.

What makes the psalm compelling is the kind of world it assumes. In that world, victory is not finally decided by chariot corps and cavalry but by whether Israel’s king stands within a living relationship to YHWH, Israel’s God. Military hardware is not denied—chariots and horses appear in v. 8—but that hardware is demoted. The psalm insists that the decisive “weapon” is God’s *name* and God’s willingness to answer.

#### Structure as liturgical drama

The poem unfolds in three movements.

**1. Communal petition (vv. 2–6).**  
The opening burst of verbs is all wish and prayer, in what grammarians call the *jussive* mood—a verb form that means “may he do X.” The congregation addresses the king:

> יַֽעַנְךָ֣ יְהוָה בְּיוֹם צָרָה;  
> יְשַׂגֶּבְךָ שֵׁם אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב.  
> “May the LORD answer *you* on a day of trouble;  
> may the name of the God of Jacob set you securely on high.” (v. 2)

The verbs pile up: “may he answer,” “protect,” “send help,” “sustain,” “remember” your offerings, “accept” them like rich fat, “grant” what your heart desires, “fulfill” your plans (vv. 2–5). The effect is incantatory. This is not a cool, measured collect; it is a cascade of pleas.

Already here, the psalm’s theology is distinctive. Help comes “from the sanctuary” and “from Zion” (v. 3: מִקֹּדֶשׁ… מִצִּיּוֹן), not in the abstract but from the specific place where God “causes his name to dwell.” Deuteronomy repeatedly uses that idiom:  

> “Then it shall come about that the place that the LORD your God will choose *to cause his name to dwell there* (לְשַׁכֵּן שְׁמוֹ שָׁם), there you shall bring all that I command you…” (Deut 12:11).

Psalm 20 assumes this Deuteronomic theology. God’s “name”—שֵׁם—is not merely a label. It is the mode of God’s localized presence and power. So in v. 2 it is “the name of the God of Jacob” itself that “keeps you safe” (יְשַׂגֶּבְךָ): the name functions almost as an actor.

The mention of “the God of Jacob” has long invited reflection. Radak, following midrash, notes that Jacob’s life was one long series of crises—Laban, Esau, famine—so “God of Jacob” is the epithet you use when you are thinking about survival in trouble. Genesis itself has Jacob say, “the God who answers me on the day of my distress” (הָעֹנֶה אֹתִי בְּיוֹם צָרָתִי; Gen 35:3). Psalm 20 consciously plugs the king’s impending battle into that older story of threatened survival.

Verse 4 anchors the prayer in cultic reality: “May he remember all your grain‑offerings (מִנְחֹתֶיךָ), and your burnt‑offering (עוֹלָתְךָ) may he *make fat* (יְדַשְּׁנֶה).” In biblical idiom, when God “remembers,” he acts. When God “remembered” Noah, the waters receded; when he “remembered” his covenant, the exodus began. Here he is asked to remember not generic piety but specific sacrificial acts and to find them as satisfying as rich fat. The verb “make fat” (דָּשֵׁן) is deliberately visceral, almost culinary.

**2. The pivot: from “may he” to “now I know” (v. 7).**  
Suddenly the tone shifts. After five verses of “may he… may he…,” someone announces:

> עַתָּה יָדַעְתִּי כִּי הוֹשִׁיעַ יְהוָה מְשִׁיחוֹ;  
> יַעֲנֵהוּ מִשְּׁמֵי קָדְשׁוֹ  
> בִּגְבֻרוֹת יֵשַׁע יְמִינוֹ.  
> “Now I know that the LORD gives victory to his anointed;  
> he will answer him from his holy heavens  
> with the mighty victories of his right hand.” (v. 7)

The verbs change tense: from pleas about what God *might* do to a perfect form—“I have come to know”—about what God *will* do. The king, previously addressed as “you,” is now “his anointed” (מְשִׁיחוֹ), in the third person. A new voice has entered.

Who is this “I”? Traditional Jewish commentators already sensed the puzzle. Ibn Ezra suggests that either “each and every one of Israel will say: ‘Now I know’,” or these are the poet’s words “with the holy spirit”—that is, inspired speech. Radak hears the people speaking together. Malbim imagines a historical moment: while the congregation in Zion is still praying for David, messengers rush in with news that he has been saved; someone—perhaps the choirmaster—interrupts the liturgy with this cry of recognition.

However we stage it, the function is clear. The liturgy is not merely wishful thinking; it includes an oracle‑like moment of assurance. And the spatial focus has moved. Earlier, help was to come “from the sanctuary… from Zion” (v. 3). Now the same verb “answer” is used, but its source is “from his holy heavens” (מִשְּׁמֵי קָדְשׁוֹ). The earthly sanctuary is understood as the earthly footprint of a heavenly throne room. The help that descends from Zion is, as it were, wired up to a higher command center.

The imagery of God’s “right hand” (יָמִין) as the instrument of salvation is a standard biblical metaphor. The Song at the Sea exults, “Your right hand, LORD, glorious in power… shatters the enemy” (יְמִינְךָ יְהוָה נֶאְדָּרִי בַּכֹּחַ; Exod 15:6). Psalm 118 proclaims, “The right hand of the LORD is exalted; the right hand of the LORD does valiantly” (יְמִין יְהוָה רוֹמֵמָה… עֹשָׂה חָיִל; Ps 118:16). Psalm 20 stands in that same divine‑warrior tradition, but inserts it into a temple ritual.

**3. The great contrast: chariots vs. the name (vv. 8–9) and the final plea (v. 10).**  
After the oracle, the community draws the theological conclusion:

> אֵלֶּה בָרֶכֶב וְאֵלֶּה בַסּוּסִים;  
> וַאֲנַחְנוּ בְּשֵׁם־יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ נַזְכִּיר. (v. 8)  
> “These rely on chariots and those on horses;  
> but we invoke the name of the LORD our God.”

The Hebrew mimics the contrast: אֵלֶּה… וְאֵלֶּה… וַאֲנַחְנוּ (“these… and these… but we”). Chariots and horses were the tanks and fighter jets of the ancient Near East. Deuteronomy, uneasy with royal militarization, warned: “He shall not multiply horses for himself… and shall not send the people back to Egypt to multiply horses” (Deut 17:16). Isaiah mocked those “who go down to Egypt for help and rely on horses… but do not look to the Holy One of Israel” (Isa 31:1). Hosea has Israel promise, “Assyria shall not save us; we will not ride on horses” (Hos 14:4).

Psalm 20 compresses that strand of tradition into a liturgical slogan. A closely related psalm, Psalm 33, makes the same argument in prose:

> “A king is not saved by great might;  
> a warrior is not delivered by great strength.  
> A horse is a vain thing for victory (שֶׁקֶר הַסּוּס לִתְשׁוּעָה),  
> nor does its great power deliver.” (Ps 33:16–17)

Both psalms also speak of “the counsel” (עֵצָה) that actually stands—“the counsel of the LORD stands forever” (Ps 33:11)—and of trusting in God’s “holy name” (Ps 33:21). It is hard to avoid the conclusion that Psalms 20 and 33 were shaped as a deliberate pair: one a royal liturgy, one a more general hymn, both teaching that conventional power is a lie unless subordinated to the God who truly saves.

The verb for what the community does with the name—נַזְכִּיר—is deliberately multivalent. The root ז־כ־ר can mean “remember,” “mention,” “invoke,” or even “proclaim/boast.” Rashi, thinking in cultic terms, connects it with “he who burns (מַזְכִּיר) incense” (Isa 66:3), reading the line as “we will offer prayer and sacrifice in the name.” Others hear it as, “we will proclaim/boast of the name.” Either way, the point is that the name, not the armory, is the axis of confidence.

Verse 9 describes the outcome as if it were already visible:

> הֵמָּה כָּרְעוּ וְנָפָלוּ;  
> וַאֲנַחְנוּ קַמְנוּ וַנִּתְעוֹדָד.  
> “They have knelt and fallen;  
> but we have arisen and stand firm.”

The perfect tense (“have fallen,” “have arisen”) is what scholars call a “prophetic perfect”: a future so certain that it can be narrated as past. The pair “knelt and fell” (כָּרְעוּ וְנָפָלוּ) recurs almost verbatim in Isaiah 46:2, where Babylon’s gods Bel and Nebo “cower, they bow down together; they cannot rescue the burden.” Idols in Isaiah and war‑horses in Psalm 20 end the same way: on the ground, powerless.

The psalm ends by circling back to petition, but with a twist:

> יְהוָה הוֹשִׁיעָה;  
> הַמֶּלֶךְ יַעֲנֵנוּ בְיוֹם־קׇרְאֵנוּ. (v. 10)  
> “O LORD, save!  
> May the King answer us on the day we call.”

Who is “the King” (הַמֶּלֶךְ)? Medieval Jewish commentators are divided. Ibn Ezra leans toward reading it vocatively—“O King, answer us”—as another title for God. Radak agrees: here “the King” is “God, the King of the universe.” But in context, one can also hear the human king: “May the king answer us when we call,” that is, may our prayer for him become his own intercession for us. The ambiguity is theologically appropriate. In Israel’s imagination, the Davidic king is never simply a warlord; he is YHWH’s “anointed” (מָשִׁיחַ), the human through whom divine kingship is mediated. A plea addressed to God and a plea addressed to the king can collapse into one.

Underneath all this runs a quiet refrain‑like pattern built on the verb “answer” (ענה). The psalm begins, “May the LORD answer *you*” (יַעַנְךָ; v. 2), pivots on “he will answer *him*” (יַעֲנֵהוּ; v. 7), and ends, “may [the King] answer *us*” (יַעֲנֵנוּ; v. 10). You, him, us. The community prays for the king; the king is assured of God’s answer; and the people, in turn, ask to be answered. The structure itself enacts a theology of mutual dependence under one sovereign God.

Seen as a whole, then, Psalm 20 is not a tranquil meditation but a compact liturgical drama. It begins in the anxiety of a “day of trouble,” moves through a moment of oracular assurance, and ends with a confident but still urgent cry. Its bold claim is that the real battlefield is not only “out there” with chariots and horses, but “in here” in the sanctuary, where prayer is offered and God’s name is invoked. Worship, in that sense, is itself a form of warfare.

  
---LITURGICAL-SECTION-START---

#### Full psalm

In Jewish prayer, Psalm 20 (*Lamenatzeach*) is treated as a psalm for times of need. It is recited in full on weekdays in the morning service. In the Ashkenazic rite it follows the Amidah as part of *Tachanun*, the penitential supplications; in many Sefardic and Edot ha‑Mizrach rites it appears among the concluding prayers, often after *Ashrei* (Psalm 145). Its opening line is heard as a direct prayer for the congregation itself:  

> יַעֲנֵנוּ יְהוָה בְּיוֹם צָרָה; יְשַׂגְּבֵנוּ שֵׁם אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב.  
> “May the LORD answer *us* on a day of trouble; may the name of the God of Jacob lift us high.”

Significantly, the psalm is omitted on Shabbat and festivals, when public mourning and supplication are set aside. It also appears, with special intensity, in the *Yom Kippur Katan* service (a mini‑fast observed before Rosh Chodesh), where it introduces longer series of penitential prayers.

#### Key verses

The final verse, v. 10, is one of the most frequently quoted single lines in the entire psalter:

> יְהוָה הוֹשִׁיעָה; הַמֶּלֶךְ יַעֲנֵנוּ בְיוֹם קׇרְאֵנוּ.  
> “O LORD, save! May the King answer us on the day we call.”

In the daily liturgy it closes the three‑verse sequence that concludes *Uva le‑Tzion*:  

> יְהוָה צְבָאוֹת עִמָּנוּ…  
> יְהוָה צְבָאוֹת, אַשְׁרֵי אָדָם בֹּטֵחַ בָּךְ…  
> יְהוָה הוֹשִׁיעָה; הַמֶּלֶךְ יַעֲנֵנוּ בְיוֹם קׇרְאֵנוּ.  

“The LORD of hosts is with us… LORD of hosts, happy is the man who trusts in you… O LORD, save! May the King answer us on the day we call.” Here the verse becomes a daily, almost mantra‑like petition for God’s responsiveness.

The same line is recited before the concluding *Ne’ilah* prayers on Yom Kippur and in various *Selichot* (penitential) services on fast days, underscoring its role as a climax of communal pleading.

#### Phrases

Several phrases from Psalm 20 have been woven into other prayers.

- Verse 2, in plural form, appears in the extended *Tachanun* of Mondays and Thursdays:  

  > יַעֲנֵנוּ יְהוָה בְּיוֹם צָרָה; יְשַׂגְּבֵנוּ שֵׁם אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב.  
  > “May the LORD answer us on a day of trouble; may the name of the God of Jacob protect us.”

  Here the royal “you” has become “us,” democratizing the psalm’s royal intercession.

- Verse 6’s closing petition, “May the LORD fulfill all your petitions” (יְמַלֵּא יְהוָה כָּל מִשְׁאֲלוֹתֶיךָ), is echoed in the Sefardic *Birkat ha‑Chodesh* (Blessing of the New Month), which asks for “a life in which the LORD will fulfill the requests of our hearts for good” (חַיִּים שֶׁיְמַלֵּא יְהוָה מִשְׁאֲלוֹת לִבֵּנוּ לְטוֹבָה).

Through these reuses, the tradition extends Psalm 20 beyond the narrow setting of royal war to the wider experience of personal and communal crisis: any “day of trouble” can be prayed through this psalm.

### REVISED VERSE COMMENTARY

**Verse 1**

לַמְנַצֵּחַ; מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד.  
“For the leader; a psalm of David.”

The superscription does more than give a title; it hints at how the psalm was used. לַמְנַצֵּחַ (lamnatzéach) literally comes from a root meaning “to be pre‑eminent” or “to oversee.” In Chronicles it describes Levitical officials “appointed over” the music of the Temple (e.g., 1 Chr 15:21, 23:4). Most modern scholars, following this usage, take לַמְנַצֵּחַ to mean “for the choirmaster” or “for the director”—a performance note indicating that this psalm belongs to the repertoire of the Temple musicians.

The Greek translators of the Septuagint rendered it εἰς τὸ τέλος, “for the end,” probably reading a slightly different Hebrew or understanding it eschatologically. That rendering deeply influenced Christian interpretation, but it obscures the cultic setting that the Hebrew suggests: this is a piece meant to be *performed*.

The phrase מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד raises the old question: does the לְ (le‑) mean “by David,” “for David,” or “about David”? Psalm 20 makes the second option particularly attractive. From v. 2 onward, the speaker addresses an unnamed “you,” whom v. 7 later identifies as God’s “anointed” (מְשִׁיחוֹ)—the king. Radak and the medieval commentator Meiri both propose that the psalm was “composed by David for the Levites to say about him whenever he went out to war.” In that reading, “a psalm *for* David” means “a psalm to be recited on his behalf.”

Liturgically, the heading acquired a second life. In the expanded *Pesukei de‑Zimra* on Shabbat and festivals many communities recite the closing verse of the psalm, “O LORD, save, may the King answer us” (יְהוָה הוֹשִׁיעָה…), and then immediately: לַמְנַצֵּחַ מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד. That pairing turns the superscription itself into a kind of response: after pleading for salvation, we remind ourselves that what follows is not our improvisation but “a psalm of David,” a tested liturgy for days of trouble.

So from the outset Psalm 20 situates itself: this is a song from the royal court’s prayer‑book, entrusted to the Temple’s musical director, designed for public use when the Davidic king goes to war.

---

**Verse 2**

יַֽעַנְךָ֣ יְהוָה בְּיוֹם צָרָה;  
יְשַׂגֶּבְךָ שֵׁם אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב.  
“May the LORD answer you on a day of trouble;  
may the name of the God of Jacob set you on high.”

The liturgy begins with a double wish. Grammatically, both יַעַנְךָ (“may he answer you”) and יְשַׂגֶּבְךָ (“may he protect you/set you high”) are in the *jussive* form—a verb form in Hebrew that expresses desire or petition, the equivalent of English “may he…” This tone of intercession continues through v. 6.

“Day of trouble” (בְּיוֹם צָרָה) is a stock biblical phrase for acute crisis, often military. Psalm 50:15, for instance, has God say, “Call upon me in the day of trouble (בְּיוֹם צָרָה); I will rescue you, and you shall honor me.” Here the crisis is the king’s impending battle.

Two features deserve special attention.

First, the verb for protection, שָׂגַב (“to be/set high, inaccessible”), carries a spatial nuance. Proverbs 18:10 uses the same root in a strikingly similar way: “The name of the LORD is a strong tower; the righteous runs into it and is set high (וְשָׂגַב).” Psalm 20 effectively applies that proverb to the king. To be protected is to be lifted up out of the enemy’s reach.

Second, the subject of that verb is not “God” but “the name of the God of Jacob” (שֵׁם אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב). This is more than pious circumlocution. In Deuteronomy’s theology of centralized worship, God says he will choose a place “to cause his name to dwell there” (לְשַׁכֵּן שְׁמוֹ שָׁם; Deut 12:11). Because God is not confined by a building, it is his *name* that “dwells” in the sanctuary. Psalm 20 assumes that way of speaking: God’s name is almost personified as the agent of protection.

Why “the God of Jacob” rather than “the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob”? Radak notes that Jacob’s life, in Genesis, is particularly marked by troubles and deliverances—fleeing Esau, being exploited by Laban, returning in fear, facing famine. Jacob himself later describes God as “the one who has been my shepherd all my life long to this day, the angel who redeemed me from all evil” (Gen 48:15–16). To invoke “the God of Jacob” is to invoke a God who specializes in rescuing people in tight spots.

In the weekday *Tachanun* prayers this verse is adapted to the first person plural—“May the LORD answer *us* on a day of trouble; may the name of the God of Jacob protect *us*”—explicitly transferring the royal prayer to the whole community.

---

**Verse 3**

יִשְׁלַח־עֶזְרְךָ מִקֹּדֶשׁ;  
וּמִצִּיּוֹן יִסְעָדֶךָ.  
“May he send you help from the sanctuary;  
from Zion may he support you.”

The verse’s power lies in its geography. The help (עֶזֶר) does not float down from a vague heaven; it is dispatched “from the sanctuary” (מִקֹּדֶשׁ) and “from Zion” (מִצִּיּוֹן). The two terms stand in parallel. “Sanctuary” in this context is the inner holy place of the Temple, where the ark once stood; “Zion” is the hill on which the Temple complex sits. The line moves from the cultic room to the larger city‑mountain, much as later psalms say, “The LORD will bless you *from Zion*” (מִצִּיּוֹן; Ps 128:5).

The first verb, יִשְׁלַח (“may he send”), underscores that help is not inherently resident in the sanctuary; it is *sent* forth from there, at God’s initiative. The second verb, יִסְעָדֶךָ (“may he sustain/support you”), comes from a root (סעד) used both for physical support and for fortifying someone with food—“sustain the heart with bread” (Gen 18:5). Here it has the sense of bolstering, holding up, undergirding the king.

Traditional commentators are sensitive to the way sacred space is functioning. Ibn Ezra glosses מִקֹּדֶשׁ simply as “from the place of the ark.” Radak writes, “For there is the Glory [the divine presence], and from there he will send your help in battle.” The sanctuary is the operational center of God’s intervention, the place where earth’s troubles are brought into heaven’s notice.

Yet Psalm 20 will not leave the matter there. In v. 7, we are told that God answers “from his holy heavens” (מִשְּׁמֵי קָדְשׁוֹ). The same God who “sends help from the sanctuary” also answers from a higher level. The earthly Temple, with its “holy place,” is the visible node of a larger, invisible network—the biblical version of an axis mundi, a connecting point between worlds.

The pairing of “help” (עֶזֶר) and Zion reappears in Psalm 33:20: “Our soul waits for the LORD; he is our help and our shield” (עֶזְרֵנוּ וּמָגִנֵּנוּ הוּא). Both psalms teach that the Temple is not a magical fortress; it is the place from which a personal God chooses to send what we most lack.

---

**Verse 4**

יִזְכֹּר כָּל־מִנְחֹתֶךָ;  
וְעֹלָתְךָ יְדַשְּׁנֶה סֶּלָה.  
“May he remember all your grain‑offerings;  
and your burnt‑offering may he make fat. Selah.”

Here the prayer turns explicitly to sacrifices. Two standard offerings are named. מִנְחָה is the grain‑offering: fine flour mixed with oil and incense, some burned on the altar, the rest consumed by priests (Leviticus 2). עֹלָה is the whole burnt‑offering, entirely consumed in fire, “ascending” (עָלָה) in smoke to God.

The petition that God “remember” (יִזְכֹּר) the king’s grain‑offerings is not about divine recollection in a psychological sense. In biblical rhetoric, when God “remembers,” he *acts*. “God remembered Noah… and God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided” (Gen 8:1); “God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her and opened her womb” (Gen 30:22). Here, the offerings are what God is asked to remember as he decides whether to give victory.

The second verb is unusual: יְדַשְּׁנֶה, from דָּשֵׁן, “to be/make fat.” BDB remarks that it means God will “find [the] burnt‑offering fat = acceptable”—a bold anthropomorphism. Leviticus repeatedly says that the fat portions of sacrifices produce a “pleasing aroma” (רֵיחַ נִיחֹחַ) to the LORD (e.g., Lev 2:12). Psalm 20 compresses that sensory language into a single verb: may God treat your burnt‑offerings as richly satisfying.

Rashi, writing long after the Temple’s destruction, spiritualizes the line: the “grain‑offerings” and “burnt‑offerings” are the prayers Israel offers in battle. Even so, he keeps the concrete flavor of the verb: “He will accept them willingly like fat burnt‑offerings” (כְּעוֹלוֹת מְחִים).

The small word סֶּלָה at the end marks a pause—perhaps a musical interlude, perhaps a moment for the offering to be placed on the altar in an actual ritual. Its exact technical meaning eludes us, but functionally it punctuates the psalm, dividing the sacrificial section (vv. 3–4) from the next movement, which turns to the king’s inner life.

Theologically, the verse treads a careful line. It clearly links divine aid with the king’s worship: God is asked to recall past offerings and respond favorably now. But the psalm never quite says that sacrifice mechanically *earns* victory. Sacrifices are signs of covenant loyalty; what they secure is not a contractual payoff but a relationship in which it makes sense to ask for help.

**Verse 5**

יִתֵּן־לְךָ כִלְבָבֶךָ;  
וְכָל־עֲצָתְךָ יְמַלֵּא.  
“May he grant you according to your heart;  
and may he fulfill all your counsel.”

The focus shifts from the Temple to the king’s inner life. Two domains are named: the “heart” (לֵבָב) and “counsel/plan” (עֵצָה).

כִלְבָבֶךָ literally means “as your heart [wills]”—what we might paraphrase as “your heart’s desire.” A very similar phrase appears in the closely related Psalm 21, which looks back on a victory already received: “You have given him his heart’s desire (תַּאֲוַת לִבּוֹ נָתַתָּה לוֹ)” (Ps 21:3). Psalm 20 anticipates that moment; Psalm 21 celebrates it.

The second half of the verse moves from desire to deliberation. עֵצָה is both “counsel” in the sense of advice given and “plan” in the sense of a considered strategy. Proverbs says, “By wise guidance you wage your war” (בְּתַחְבֻּלוֹת תַּעֲשֶׂה לְּךָ מִלְחָמָה; Prov 24:6); Radak quotes that line to explain our verse. The psalm does not imagine that the king wins by pious passivity; he still needs good plans. But those plans, like his desires, are placed under God’s sovereignty.

The verb “fulfill” (יְמַלֵּא, from מָלֵא, “to fill”) recurs in v. 6: “May the LORD fulfill all your petitions” (יְמַלֵּא יְהוָה כָּל־מִשְׁאֲלוֹתֶיךָ). Between the two lines, we have “all your counsel” and “all your petitions,” both under the rubric of “may he fulfill.” The repetition creates a kind of internal refrain and stresses totality: nothing the king rightly plans or asks lies outside God’s concern.

A tension lurks just beneath the surface. What if the king’s heart is not aligned with God’s? A midrash, quoted by Radak, resolves this by limiting the blessing to David: because he “was wholehearted before his Creator,” one could safely pray, “May he grant you according to your heart.” For ordinary mortals, our hearts are unreliable; for David, the supposition is that his desires are already tuned to God’s will.

The concept of “counsel” (עֵצָה) also links Psalm 20 with Psalm 33. There we read, “The LORD brings to nothing the counsel of the nations… The counsel of the LORD stands forever” (עֲצַת יְהוָה לְעוֹלָם תַּעֲמֹד; Ps 33:10–11). Psalm 20 prays that the king’s counsel be fulfilled; Psalm 33 insists that only God’s own counsel truly stands. Read together, they suggest that the only reliable royal plans are those that coincide with God’s.

**Verse 6**

נְרַנְּנָה בִּישׁוּעָתֶךָ;  
וּבְשֵׁם־אֱלֹהֵינוּ נִדְגֹּל;  
יְמַלֵּא יְהוָה כָּל־מִשְׁאֲלוֹתֶיךָ.  
“May we shout for joy in your victory;  
and in the name of our God may we raise the banner;  
may the LORD fulfill all your petitions.”

Here, for the first time, the “we” of the congregation steps into the foreground: נְרַנְּנָה (“let us shout/sing”). The community’s fate is bound up with the king’s. “Your victory” (יְשׁוּעָתֶךָ) will be their joy.

The verb רנן (“cry out, sing for joy”) is one of the psalter’s favorite words for exuberant worship. It appears, for example, in Psalm 33:1, “Sing for joy in the LORD, O you righteous” (רַנְּנוּ צַדִּיקִים בַּיהוָה). Psalm 20 links that jubilant noise not just to any success but specifically to “your salvation/victory”—the outcome of the battle we have just prayed about.

The middle line introduces a rare and vivid verb: נִדְגֹּל, from the noun דֶּגֶל, “banner, standard.” The noun is familiar from the wilderness narratives, where each tribe camps “by its banner” (עַל־דִּגְלוֹ; Num 2:2). But the verb form occurs only here in the Bible. BDB glosses it as a denominative: “to carry or set up a standard.” The sense is likely, “we will muster under banners in the name of our God” or “we will raise our banner in God’s name.”

Traditional Jewish interpreters take it in that directional sense. Radak paraphrases, “In his name we will lift up our standard and our ensign” (בִּשְׁמוֹ נָרִים נִסֵּנוּ וְדִגְלֵנוּ). Malbim draws out the theology: when we raise our battle‑flags, they will not display royal emblems or animals but the divine name, because YHWH himself is the true commander of the host.

The closing line, with its jussive יְמַלֵּא (“may he fulfill”), echoes v. 5 but shifts the object from “counsel” to “petitions” (מִשְׁאֲלוֹת, from the root שׁאל, “to ask”). The psalm has now named three layers of the king’s inner life: heart’s desire, strategic counsel, and explicit prayer. All three are swept up into the community’s intercession.

Sefardic liturgy makes particularly rich use of this language. In the blessing for the new month, the congregation asks for “a life in which the LORD will fulfill the requests of our hearts for good” (חַיִּים שֶׁיְמַלֵּא יְהוָה מִשְׁאֲלוֹת לִבֵּנוּ לְטוֹבָה), clearly echoing “may the LORD fulfill all your petitions.” The royal vocabulary is repurposed for ordinary worshipers, who are invited to see their own hopes as petitions God can “fill out” to completion.

**Verse 7**

עַתָּה יָדַעְתִּי כִּי הוֹשִׁיעַ יְהוָה מְשִׁיחוֹ;  
יַעֲנֵהוּ מִשְּׁמֵי קָדְשׁוֹ;  
בִּגְבֻרוֹת יֵשַׁע יְמִינוֹ.  
“Now I know that the LORD gives victory to his anointed;  
he will answer him from his holy heavens,  
with the mighty victories of his right hand.”

This is the hinge on which the psalm turns.

The opening adverb עַתָּה (“now”) signals more than a temporal moment; it marks a change of stance—from petition (“may he…”) to confidence (“I know…”). The verb יָדַעְתִּי is a perfect form, implying completed knowledge: “I have come to know.” The combination of עַתָּה + perfect (“now I know”) is used elsewhere to signal a moment of recognition (e.g., “Now I know that you fear God,” Gen 22:12).

Who is speaking? The psalm does not say. The abrupt shift to first‑person singular after a series of “we”s and “you”s has prompted a range of proposals: a cult prophet delivering an oracle of salvation; the high priest; the king himself; a soloist speaking for the choir. Ibn Ezra, as noted above, opts for “each and every person” or for the inspired poet. From a literary point of view, the ambiguity may be deliberate: an unnamed voice—some authorized “I”—interrupts the communal petition with a flash of assurance.

The content of that assurance is striking. YHWH “gives victory” (הוֹשִׁיעַ) not to “you” but to “his anointed” (מְשִׁיחוֹ)—the king seen explicitly as God’s chosen and consecrated servant. The noun מָשִׁיחַ (“anointed one”) is used in the Hebrew Bible both for kings (especially Davidic kings) and for high priests. In the psalms, it almost always refers to the Davidic ruler through whom God’s purposes for Israel are mediated (see Ps 2:2; 18:51; 28:8; 89:39).

The verse also revisits the spatial theme from v. 3 but raises the stakes: God will “answer him from his holy heavens” (מִשְּׁמֵי קָדְשׁוֹ). The plural “heavens of his holiness” evokes not just the sky but the divine dwelling. Psalm 11:4 similarly pairs temple and heaven: “The LORD is in his holy temple; the LORD’s throne is in heaven.” Psalm 20, by speaking first of help “from the sanctuary” (מִקֹּדֶשׁ) and then of an answer “from his holy heavens,” underscores the vertical link between earthly liturgy and heavenly decision.

Finally, the closing image of God’s “right hand” (יְמִינוֹ) doing “mighty acts of salvation” (גְּבֻרוֹת יֵשַׁע) roots the oracle in the broader tradition of God as a warrior on Israel’s behalf. The word גְּבוּרָה, “might, valour,” is often used of soldiers; here, God’s right hand performs the feats. Psalm 89 celebrates, “Yours is an arm with might; your hand is strong; your right hand is exalted” (לְךָ זְרוֹעַ עִם־גְּבוּרָה; Ps 89:14). The combination of “right hand” and “salvation” appears again in Psalms 108 and 118. Psalm 20 condenses that familiar theology into a liturgical assurance spoken at a crucial moment: before the king departs, someone stands and says, “Now I know…”

**Verse 8**

אֵלֶּה בָרֶכֶב וְאֵלֶּה בַסּוּסִים;  
וַאֲנַחְנוּ בְּשֵׁם־יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ נַזְכִּיר.  
“These rely on chariots and those on horses;  
but we invoke the name of the LORD our God.”

This verse condenses the psalm’s theology into an aphorism.

The structure is elegantly antithetical. The demonstrative pronoun אֵלֶּה (“these”) is repeated: אֵלֶּה… וְאֵלֶּה… (“these… and these…”), followed by the emphatic וַאֲנַחְנוּ (“but we”). The contrast is total. “They” (foreign nations, enemies) trust in chariots and horses; “we” trust in the name.

Chariots (רֶכֶב) and horses (סוּסִים) were the most prestigious and feared arms of ancient Near Eastern warfare. Egypt was famous for its chariotry; Assyria and later empires boasted huge cavalry forces. It is no accident that Deuteronomy’s law for the king warns, “He shall not multiply horses for himself… and he shall not send the people back to Egypt in order to multiply horses” (Deut 17:16). The accumulation of war‑horses symbolized a kind of self‑reliance at odds with covenant trust.

The prophets take up the theme. Isaiah cries, “Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help and rely on horses, who trust in chariots because they are many… but do not look to the Holy One of Israel” (Isa 31:1). Hosea has Israel promise, “Assyria shall not save us; we will not ride on horses” (Hos 14:4). Psalm 20 participates in this polemic but turns it into a line for congregational recitation.

Psalm 33, as we have seen, is almost an extended commentary on this verse: “A king is not saved by a great army (בְּרֹב חָיִל)… a horse is a false hope for salvation (שֶׁקֶר הַסּוּס לִתְשׁוּעָה)” (Ps 33:16–17). Together they form a small theology of military skepticism.

The key verb for what “we” do is נַזְכִּיר, from זָכַר. In ordinary usage, the root means “remember.” In the Hiphil stem, however, it can mean “cause to remember,” “mention,” “invoke,” or even “proclaim.” Rashi hears here an echo of cultic language; he connects נַזְכִּיר with the “memorial portion” (אַזְכָּרָה) of the grain‑offering in Leviticus 2:2 and with Isaiah’s מַזְכִּיר לְבוֹנָה, “one who burns/incenses frankincense” (Isa 66:3). That is, to “cause the name to be remembered” is to offer sacrifice and prayer in it.

Others emphasize the verbal, almost boastful sense: to “call on” or “exult in” the name. Psalm 116:13, for instance, says, “I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of the LORD” (וּבְשֵׁם יְהוָה אֶקְרָא). Our psalm prefers the rarer נַזְכִּיר, but the effect is similar: the name is spoken, invoked, made present.

Note the progression of “name” phrases through the psalm. We begin with “the name of the God of Jacob” (שֵׁם אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב; v. 2), move to “the name of our God” (בְּשֵׁם אֱלֹהֵינוּ; v. 6), and arrive here at “the name of YHWH our God” (בְּשֵׁם־יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ). It is as if the identity of the one we trust is being brought into sharper focus: from the patriarchal story (“God of Jacob”) to the communal relationship (“our God”) to the full covenant formula (“YHWH our God”).

In a world that measured security in horses and iron, this line was a counter‑slogan. In a world that measures security in GDP and weaponry, it still is.

**Verse 9**

הֵמָּה כָּרְעוּ וְנָפָלוּ;  
וַאֲנַחְנוּ קַמְנוּ וַנִּתְעוֹדָד.  
“They have knelt and fallen;  
but we have arisen and are strengthened.”

This verse completes the contrast of v. 8 by projecting its outcome.

The verbs for the enemies’ downfall, כָּרְעוּ (“they have knelt/collapsed”) and נָפָלוּ (“they have fallen”), are both in the perfect tense. They read like a battlefield report: the enemy ranks buckle and go down. As noted earlier, the exact pair כָּרְעוּ וְנָפָלוּ reappears in Isaiah 46:2 about idols: “They cower, they bow down together (קָרְסוּ כָּרְעוּ יַחְדָּו); they cannot save the burden, and their own self goes into captivity.” The figurative echo is sharp: what happens to false gods in Isaiah happens to those who trust in their war‑machines in Psalm 20.

Yet in context, the perfects function as what scholars term a “prophetic perfect”: a tense form used to describe future events as if already accomplished, because they are seen as guaranteed by God’s promise.

The corresponding verbs for the community’s fate are equally concrete. קַמְנוּ (“we have arisen”) reverses “fallen.” וַנִּתְעוֹדָד is a rare Hithpolel form from עוּד. BDB glosses this stem here as “be restored, strengthened.” The same root in a different stem appears in Psalms 146–147, where God “raises up” (מְעוֹדֵד) the lowly (Ps 146:9; 147:6). Our reflexive form suggests, “we have been set on our feet and made strong,” or “we have rallied and stiffened.”

The sound pattern reinforces the meaning. The phrase כָּרְעוּ וְנָפָלוּ, with its soft *k* and *f* sounds and rounded vowels, feels like a sagging motion. קַמְנוּ וַנִּתְעוֹדָד, with its hard *k* and doubled *d*, has more bite—a sense of firmness and renewed energy.

Some interpreters, like Malbim, see a double victory implied: not only do the enemies collapse, but “we have arisen and been strengthened” in broader ways, including prosperity and national morale. The point is that trust in God’s name does not just get one through the immediate crisis; it can leave a people in a stronger position than before.

In any case, v. 9 should be read together with v. 8. Those who rely on chariots and horses end up on the ground; those who invoke the name stand and are strengthened. The antithesis is not only between two tactics but between two outcomes.

**Verse 10**

יְהוָה הוֹשִׁיעָה;  
הַמֶּלֶךְ יַעֲנֵנוּ בְיוֹם־קׇרְאֵנוּ.  
“O LORD, save!  
May the King answer us on the day we call.”

The psalm’s final line returns us from confident declaration to urgent plea. After “Now I know” (v. 7) and “they have fallen, we have arisen” (v. 9), one might have expected the poem simply to end in triumph. Instead, it closes with the shortest of cries—“YHWH, save!”—and a request for an answer “on the day we call.”

The phrase בְּיוֹם־קׇרְאֵנוּ (“on the day we call”) forms a subtle inclusio with v. 2’s “on a day of trouble” (בְּיוֹם צָרָה). The trouble has not evaporated, but the day is now defined as a day of *calling* and anticipated answer. Psalm 86 uses similar language: “In the day of my trouble I call upon you (בְּיוֹם צָרָתִי אֶקְרָאֶךָּ), for you will answer me” (Ps 86:7). Worship turns the “day of trouble” into a “day of calling.”

The syntactic crux is the phrase הַמֶּלֶךְ יַעֲנֵנוּ. Is “the King” God or the human king? The Masoretic accent places a pause after הוֹשִׁיעָה, which slightly favors taking “the King” as the subject of יַעֲנֵנוּ rather than in apposition to “LORD.” Ibn Ezra notes three options and finally concludes that “the King is the LORD, who is truly King,” building on biblical verses that speak of God as “King of all the earth” (Ps 47:8). Radak concurs.

Yet context makes it hard to exclude the human monarch from the resonances. Throughout the psalm, “answer” (ענה) has been associated with both God and the king. The community prays that “the LORD answer you” (v. 2), then learns that God “will answer his anointed” (v. 7), then now asks that “the King answer us.” Malbim ingeniously hears here a kind of double agency: when we cry “O LORD, save,” we receive an answering word from the human king David, who himself is testifying that his only hope is in the LORD’s salvation. The line collapses divine and royal response into one.

Liturgically, the verse has functioned almost exclusively as a plea to God. In the *Uva le‑Tzion* triad and in fast‑day *Selichot*, it is clearly heard as “O LORD, save; O King, answer us.” But the very possibility of the double reading is theologically suggestive. The Davidic king is not a free‑standing sovereign; his legitimacy and efficacy derive entirely from the God whose name he bears. To ask the King for an answer is, in the end, to ask the LORD.

With this, the psalm leaves us not on the battlefield but back in the sanctuary, mid‑petition. The chariots and horses are still out there. What has changed is that a community has named where its trust lies and has heard, however obliquely, that its king is “his anointed,” upheld by “the mighty acts of salvation of his right hand.”
