# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 145

What works: The draft rightly frames Psalm 145 as a summa of praise, notices the acrostic form, tracks the psalm’s movement from royal transcendence to intimate care, and highlights the “all” motif as a structural drumbeat. It makes good use of classical commentators (Radak, Ibn Ezra, Malbim, Meiri) and catches the theological pivot from v. 13 to v. 14. The note on the abbreviated citation of Exodus 34:6 is perceptive, as is the insistence that v. 20’s judgment belongs inside, not outside, the psalm’s universal benevolence.

What needs work: 
- The introduction occasionally overreaches (e.g., firm counts like “sixteen times” for kol without documentation) and sometimes asserts rather than demonstrates. 
- Several terms go undefined for lay readers (acrostic, inclusio, colon, MT, LXX, Pual), and some grammatical talk (“Polel”) risks jargon without payoff.
- The commentary underuses the available tools: the LXX “nun” line in v. 13 is mentioned but not integrated as a textual witness; figures like “the eyes of all” and “open your hand” need biblical comparanda (Psalm 104:27; Deuteronomy 15:8–11) and patterning; “ain ḥeqar” (unsearchable) deserves Jobsian echoes (Job 5:9; 9:10; Isaiah 40:28). 
- Sound and structure get short shrift: the triple construct in v. 5 (“hadar kevod hod”) invites comment on poetic piling; the shift from second-person address to third-person declaration at v. 3 is a marked rhetorical move. 
- The piece gestures at ANE background for v. 13 but doesn’t develop how Israel’s royal idiom is adapted polemically. 
- A few big questions raised by the macro/micro analysis are answerable here: the theological function of the acrostic; how “kol basar” (v. 21) likely means “all humanity” in context; how v. 20’s “destroy the wicked” coheres with v. 9’s universality; what “in truth” (v. 18) requires.

Figurative language: Specific biblical parallels should be cited and analyzed, not gestured at. For example, “the eyes of all” (v. 15) should be set beside Psalm 104:27 and Psalm 123:2; “opening the hand” (v. 16) against Deuteronomy 15:8–11; “unsearchable” (v. 3) against Job 5:9; 9:10; Isaiah 40:28. These comparisons illuminate distinctive emphases here (e.g., an ecological horizon in 145 that is both lyrical and theologically thick).

In sum: tighten claims; define terms; integrate MT/LXX; mine the figurative database; deepen the literary analysis; show how universal scope and moral discernment live together in this psalm.
