# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 145

What works: The draft rightly foregrounds Psalm 145’s acrostic form, its movement from “my God” to “all flesh,” and the centrality of the Exodus 34:6 formula (v. 8). The educational (“generational”) logic of praise is well traced, and the turn from cosmic kingship to care for the vulnerable (vv. 14–16) is a fine insight. The commentary mines medieval Jewish sources to good effect, and it notices the Septuagint’s (LXX) addition at v. 13.

What needs revision: 
- Over-assertive phonetic prosody: reciting stress marks and syllable weights adds little here. We should keep sound observations only where they truly illuminate meaning.
- Occasional factual imprecision: for example, the claim that “אין חקר” (“unsearchable”) appears only three times is incorrect; the research bundle shows multiple occurrences (Job 5:9; 9:10; Isaiah 40:28; Proverbs 25:3; plus Psalm 145:3).
- Technical terms (“inclusio,” “hendiatris,” “merism,” “colon,” “LXX,” “MT”) need brief definitions for a lay audience.
- Figurative language cross-references were underused. Where the poet speaks of “pouring forth” (v. 7) or the “open hand” (v. 16), we should cite concrete parallels (e.g., Psalm 19:3; Proverbs 15:2; Deuteronomy 15:8, 11) and explain how Psalm 145 adapts these patterns.
- Textual issues: the LXX’s extra line at v. 13 should be discussed more crisply in relation to the psalm’s “completeness,” and the missing nun (נ) should be set alongside the rabbinic resolution (Berakhot 4b) without over-speculation.
- Balance: the introduction and verse notes sometimes repeat rather than develop. The introduction should set the arc; the notes should push into the local texture—syntax, idiom, intertext, reception.

Answerable questions to address: 
- How the LXX addition in v. 13a functions theologically and structurally.
- How the “pour forth” verb `yabiu` works elsewhere and why it matters here.
- Why “open your hand” (v. 16) is the rabbinic hinge for daily recitation (Torah Temimah).
- How “kol” (“all”) shapes the psalm’s universal horizon (vv. 9, 10, 14–16, 18, 20–21).

With these revisions—leaning into poetic structure, sharpened philology, defined terms, and concrete cross-references—we can produce a lucid, literarily attuned, and theologically rich guide for an intelligent general reader.
