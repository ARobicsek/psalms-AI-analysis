## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (9)

1. What is the theological significance of the missing nun verse in the acrostic, and how do ancient versions handle this gap?
2. How does the sevenfold use of 'kol' (all/every) function as a literary and theological device throughout the psalm?
3. What is the relationship between the divine character formula in v. 8 and Exodus 34:6-7, and how does this psalm expand or modify that tradition?
4. How does the Ugaritic parallel in vv. 11-13 illuminate the psalm's appropriation and transformation of Ancient Near Eastern royal ideology?
5. What is the significance of the intergenerational motif (dor le-dor) for understanding the psalm's theology of covenant continuity?
6. How does the alternation between divine transcendence (greatness, majesty) and immanence (care, provision) function structurally and theologically?
7. What is the liturgical function of the movement from individual vow to cosmic participation, and how does this relate to temple worship practices?
8. How do the specific images of divine care (supporting the falling, feeding the hungry, protecting the righteous) relate to Ancient Near Eastern royal ideology and social justice themes?
9. What is the relationship between divine kingship and divine judgment in vv. 19-20, and how does this compare to other royal psalms?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (10)

1. Why does the psalm use the rare superscription 'תְּהִלָּה' only here and Psalm 119:171?
2. What is the significance of the missing nun verse in the acrostic - textual accident or intentional theological statement?
3. How does the triple accumulation 'הֲדַר כְּבוֹד הוֹדֶךָ' function - are these distinct attributes or poetic intensification?
4. Why does the LXX add an entire extra verse (13a) about divine faithfulness?
5. How do we reconcile universal divine mercy (v.9) with universal destruction of the wicked (v.20)?
6. What motivates the dramatic shift from cosmic kingship language (vv.11-13) to concrete care imagery (vv.14-16)?
7. Why does the psalm borrow Job's 'אֵין חֵקֶר' language for divine incomprehensibility?
8. What is the theological significance of different praise verbs for creation (thank) versus faithful ones (bless) in verse 10?
9. How does 'כׇל־בָּשָׂר' (all flesh) in the conclusion relate to the cosmic scope established earlier?
10. Why integrate the exact Exodus 34:6-7 formula rather than creating original praise language?
