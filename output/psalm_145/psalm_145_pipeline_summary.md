## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (10)

1. How does the complete acrostic structure function theologically beyond literary artistry, and what does it suggest about comprehensive praise?
2. What is the significance of the divine epithet progression from 'my God the King' to 'YHWH' throughout the psalm?
3. How does the Ugaritic parallel in v. 13 illuminate the relationship between Israelite and broader ANE royal theology?
4. What is the theological significance of the movement from God's incomprehensible greatness (v. 3) to intimate care (vv. 15-16)?
5. How does the 'eyes of all' imagery (v. 15) function within the broader creation theology of the psalm?
6. What is the relationship between the generational transmission theme (vv. 4, 13) and the eternal praise framework?
7. How does the theodicy element (v. 20) fit into the comprehensive praise structure without creating tension?
8. What is the significance of the progression from 'works' and 'mighty acts' to specific care for the fallen and hungry?
9. How does this psalm function as a theological summary of praise literature in relation to other Hallel psalms?
10. What is the relationship between covenant (faithful ones, those who fear him) and creation (all flesh, all his works) in the psalm's theological vision?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (8)

1. Why is this the only psalm titled 'תְּהִלָּה' when this word gives the whole psalter its name?
2. What is the theological significance of selectively quoting the Exodus 34:6 formula while omitting 'truth and faithfulness'?
3. How does the LXX addition in v13a ('Faithful is the LORD in his words...') illuminate early interpretive traditions?
4. Is the triple construct chain 'הֲדַר כְּבוֹד הוֹדֶךָ' standard Hebrew syntax or innovative poetic accumulation?
5. How do we reconcile 'good to all' (v9) with 'destroys all the wicked' (v20) - is this theological tension intentional?
6. Why does the psalm use 'כׇּל־בָּשָׂר' (all flesh) in the conclusion rather than 'all people' or 'all creation'?
7. What is the difference between יוֹדוּךָ (praise from all works) and יְבָרְכוּכָה (bless from faithful ones) in v10?
8. Does the 'עֵינֵי־כֹל' (eyes of all) image include non-animate creation having metaphorical 'eyes'?
