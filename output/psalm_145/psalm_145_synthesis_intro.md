# Psalm 145: The Artistry of Complete Praise

Psalm 145 stands alone in the Psalter with its superscription *tehillah* (תְּהִלָּה), "a song of praise"—the very word that gives the entire book its Hebrew name. This singularity is no accident. The psalm functions as a theological summa, a comprehensive statement about the nature of divine praise that moves systematically from personal devotion to cosmic worship. Its complete acrostic structure, running from *aleph* to *tav* with only the *nun* verse missing, signals something approaching completeness—an attempt to encompass the totality of what can be said about God's character and humanity's proper response.

The psalm's engine is a carefully orchestrated tension between divine transcendence and immanence. It opens with intimate address—"my God the king" (*elohay hammelekh*, אֱלֹהַי הַמֶּלֶךְ)—yet immediately declares God's greatness beyond human comprehension: "his greatness is unsearchable" (*li-gdulato eyn heqer*, לִגְדֻלָּתוֹ אֵין חֵקֶר). The poet constructs a world where the same God who transcends all investigation also "opens his hand" (*poteah et-yadekha*, פּוֹתֵחַ אֶת־יָדֶךָ) to satisfy every living creature. This is not theological contradiction but careful design.

The psalm's universality operates on multiple registers. The repeated use of *kol* (כׇּל, "all") creates a drumbeat of inclusivity—appearing sixteen times to encompass "all his works," "all flesh," "all generations." Yet this universalism is not uniform. The poet distinguishes between creation's passive praise and the covenant community's active blessing. In verse 10, "all your works will praise you" (*yodukhah yhvh kol-ma'aseykha*, יוֹדוּךָ יְהֹוָה כׇּל־מַעֲשֶׂיךָ), but "your faithful ones will bless you" (*vahasideykha yevarekhukha*, וַחֲסִידֶיךָ יְבָרְכוּכָה). The distinction matters: universal creation offers recognition, but the covenant community provides active partnership in divine blessing.

This theological geography becomes even more intricate when the psalm shifts from cosmic kingship to intimate care. The transition from verses 13 to 14 is startling: from "your kingdom is an eternal kingdom" (*malkhutekha malkhut kol-olamim*, מַֽלְכוּתְךָ֗ מַלְכ֥וּת כׇּל־עֹלָמִ֑ים) to "the LORD supports all who fall" (*somekh yhvh lekhol-hanofliym*, סוֹמֵךְ יְהֹוָה לְכׇל־הַנֹּפְלִ֑ים). The cosmic sovereign becomes the divine caregiver, and the psalm grounds its lofty theology in the most basic human needs—food, support, and protection.

The psalm's most arresting image appears in verse 15: "the eyes of all look to you" (*eyney khol eleykha yesaberu*, עֵינֵ֣י כֹ֭ל אֵלֶ֣יךָ יְשַׂבֵּ֑רוּ). This personification extends beyond humanity to encompass all creation in a posture of expectant dependence. The image suggests a world animated by need and hope, where even inanimate creation participates metaphorically in the economy of divine provision. Traditional commentators like the Radak understood this as encompassing all living beings who "look to You according to their nature," recognizing that even creatures without rational knowledge participate in patterns of divine sustenance.

The psalm's acrostic structure raises questions about its missing *nun* verse. The Talmudic tradition (Berakhot 4b) suggests David omitted it because he foresaw Israel's future downfall (*naflah*, "she has fallen"), yet immediately followed with divine support for "all who fall." This interpretive move reveals how closely ancient readers connected the psalm's literary form with its theological content. The alphabetic completeness becomes a statement about divine comprehensiveness—God's care extends to every aspect of existence, from *aleph* to *tav*.

When the psalm quotes the classic divine attribute formula in verse 8—"gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in steadfast love" (*hanun verahum yhvh erekh apayim ugdol-hesed*, חַנּ֣וּן וְרַח֣וּם יְהֹוָ֑ה אֶ֥רֶךְ אַ֝פַּ֗יִם וּגְדׇל־חָֽסֶד)—it notably omits "abounding in faithfulness and truth" from the Exodus 34:6 original. This selective quotation emphasizes mercy over covenant fidelity, supporting the psalm's movement toward universal rather than particular divine care.

The psalm's most challenging moment comes in its penultimate verse, where universal divine goodness meets moral discrimination: "but all the wicked he will destroy" (*ve'et kol-harsha'iym yashmid*, וְאֵ֖ת כׇּל־הָרְשָׁעִ֣ים יַשְׁמִֽיד). This stark statement refuses to dissolve moral categories in divine mercy. The psalm maintains that God's universal goodness does not negate moral accountability—a tension that classical commentators like Ibn Ezra resolved by seeing divine justice as itself an expression of ultimate goodness.

The psalm concludes with a movement from personal commitment to cosmic summons. What begins as David's individual vow—"my mouth will speak the praise of the LORD" (*tehillat yhvh yedaber-piy*, תְּהִלַּ֤ת יְהֹוָ֨ה יְֽדַבֶּר־פִּ֗י)—expands into a universal call: "let all flesh bless his holy name forever" (*vivrekh kol-basar shem qodsho le'olam va'ed*, וִיבָרֵ֣ךְ כׇּל־בָּשָׂ֣ר שֵׁ֣ם קׇ֝דְשׁ֗וֹ לְעוֹלָ֥ם וָעֶֽד). The phrase *kol-basar* ("all flesh") encompasses not just humanity but all living beings, creating a vision of creation united in praise.

Psalm 145 earned its liturgical prominence—the Talmud declares that one who recites it three times daily is assured of a place in the world to come—because it successfully integrates the particular and universal dimensions of biblical faith. It affirms God's special relationship with the covenant community while maintaining divine care for all creation. It celebrates divine transcendence while insisting on intimate accessibility. It constructs a world where theological sophistication serves pastoral care, where the God beyond investigation also opens his hand to feed the hungry.

The psalm's genius lies not in choosing between these theological poles but in holding them together through the sustained metaphor of kingship. Divine majesty becomes the foundation for divine mercy, and cosmic sovereignty enables rather than eliminates personal care. In this vision, the proper human response is neither cowering before transcendence nor presuming upon accessibility, but offering the kind of complete praise that matches divine completeness—praise that encompasses both the incomprehensible mystery of God's greatness and the daily miracle of satisfied hunger.
