Psalm 145 is the only psalm in the Psalter whose heading names it explicitly as a “praise,” a tehillah. That singular label is not a marketing flourish. It tells you how to read the poem—as a crafted act of naming God rightly—and hints that this single song, placed at the head of the Psalter’s closing hallel, aims to model the art of praise in full.

Two pieces of form matter at the outset. First, the poem is an alphabetic acrostic: each verse begins with the next letter of the Hebrew alphabet. An acrostic is more than a parlor trick; in biblical poetry it often signals “from A to Z” completeness. Here the device functions theologically. Praise is an act of ordering reality—naming God’s ways from every angle—and the acrostic gives that intention a visible, memorable shape. (In Hebrew poetry a “colon” is a single line in a parallel pair; acrostics mark cola by letter.) Second, the psalm is framed by an inclusio, an envelope: the opening vow (“I will extol you… and bless your name forever and ever”) returns at the end as a universal summons (“let all flesh bless His holy name forever and ever”). An inclusio (a repeated phrase at beginning and end) not only brackets the unit but deepens the repeated words; the closing “forever” bears the weight of all that has been said in between.

Form and content move in step. The poem traces a deliberate arc from the throne room to the kitchen table. It begins with royal address—“my God the king” (`’elohay hammelekh`)—and steps back to say what can and cannot be said: “Great is the LORD… and His greatness is unsearchable.” The Hebrew uses the noun `ḥeqar`, from the world of inquiry: not merely “we have not found it out,” but “it is not a thing that can be fully searched” (compare Job 5:9; 9:10; Isaiah 40:28). Faced with that limit, the poet switches tactics. If God’s essence is beyond “search,” God’s “works” and “mighty acts” can be praised, and they can be taught “from generation to generation.” Praise turns historical and communal: this age tells the next what it has seen.

At mid-psalm the classic formula of Exodus 34:6 is quoted—“gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, and great in steadfast love”—but in a trimmed version. The omission of “truth” or “faithfulness” here is not a denial. It is a choice that fits the psalm’s purpose: the emphasis falls on mercy and forbearance as the grammar of universal care. The next line makes that explicit: “The LORD is good to all, and His mercies are over all His works.” In Hebrew, the little word “all” (kol) recurs throughout Psalm 145 like a handbell—“all His works,” “all generations,” “all who fall,” “all flesh”—to expand the horizon. This is not a sectarian hymn.

And yet the poem refuses a piety that dissolves moral distinctions. The last movement introduces discriminations: God is “near to all who call… in truth” (v. 18), fulfills the desire “of those who fear Him” (v. 19), “guards all who love Him,” and—jarringly—“destroys all the wicked” (v. 20). The universal “all” does not erase the difference between calling and not calling, fearing and scorning, love and predation. The psalm holds these realities together without apology. The claim that “the LORD is good to all” describes creation-wide providence; the claims about nearness, fulfillment, guarding, and judgment describe covenantal relationship and moral governance.

One image lets the psalm tie transcendence to bread on the table. “The eyes of all look to you,” it says, “and you give them their food in its season… you open your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing.” This is deliberate echo. “Open your hand” (`patoach tiftach et-yadkha`) is a legal idiom for human generosity in Deuteronomy 15:8–11; here the poet places that human ethic in God’s hand. The psalm thereby grounds compassion in the divine life and invites human imitation. “The eyes of all look” is equally rich. It is used elsewhere of creation’s dependence (Psalm 104:27) and of servants’ expectant attention (Psalm 123:2). Psalm 145 gathers both senses: creaturely need and patient, focused hope. The voice is not naively pastoral; predators also eat (v. 17 will face this with the word “righteous”), but the claim is that the open hand behind the food chain is providence, not indifference.

There are two notorious textual notes. The acrostic is missing a line for the letter nun. Rabbinic tradition retrieves the omission with a midrashic flourish: David “saw” the fall of Israel (Amos 5:2) and refused to inscribe it in the praise alphabet, only to “support” the fallen in the next verse (“The LORD upholds all who fall,” v. 14). Ancient translators made a different choice. The Greek Septuagint (LXX), an early Jewish translation, inserts an additional line after v. 13: “Faithful is the LORD in all His words and holy in all His works.” The inserted line begins with nun in Hebrew and restores the acrostic. Both traditions teach us how ancient readers heard the psalm: either by letting the missing letter become part of the poem’s message, or by supplying what the structure seemed to want. (LXX is the standard abbreviation for the Septuagint; MT denotes the Masoretic Hebrew text.)

Finally, the psalm’s politics are not abstract. “Your kingdom is a kingdom of all ages” borrows and transforms the royal language of the ancient Near East. In Ugaritic hymns to Baal, “eternal kingship” is a standard boast. Psalm 145 appropriates the idiom and redirects it: the true eternal reign belongs to Israel’s God. That polemic clears theological space for the next line, which is not imperial: “The LORD supports all who fall.” In this psalm, kingship is not about annexing territory. It is about justice with a human face and a hand that opens.

A few terms defined for the road:
- Acrostic: a poem whose lines begin with successive letters (here, Aleph to Tav), often signaling completeness.
- Inclusio: an envelope structure in which opening language returns at the end to frame the whole.
- Parallelism: the dominant Hebrew poetic technique in which the second half-line (colon) answers or intensifies the first (“A is so, and what’s more, B”).
- Colon: one line of Hebrew poetry in a parallel pair.
- MT/LXX: abbreviations for the traditional Hebrew text (Masoretic Text) and the ancient Greek translation (Septuagint).

Read this hymn, then, as more than uplift. It is a carefully built argument about reality: God’s greatness cannot be “searched out,” so praise must move to God’s public works; this God’s reign is not a threat but a shelter; and the grammar of praise is learned by looking steadily at the hand that feeds “all” and at the face that draws near when we call “in truth.”
