Psalm 145 announces itself with an unusual title: not the customary “psalm” (`mizmor`) but “praise” (`tehillah`). That single word tells you what the poem is for. It is not plea or complaint; it is sustained doxology—praise as practiced, learned, and taught. The poem is also an acrostic: each verse begins with the next letter of the Hebrew alphabet. An acrostic in biblical poetry is not a parlor trick; it is a way of implying completeness, an A-to-Z of what can be said. Here that form becomes pedagogy. If praise is the art the community must keep alive, the alphabet scaffolds that art so it can be taught “generation to generation” (v. 4).

One letter is famously missing: nun (נ). The rabbis heard in that absence a dark echo—Amos 5:2’s “Fallen (naflah), no more to rise, is the virgin Israel”—and then pointed to the very next verse as the correction: “The LORD supports all who fall” (v. 14). The gap itself becomes instruction. Praise is honest enough to leave a space for collapse, and faithful enough to follow it immediately with a divine counterword.

The poem’s architecture is elegant and deliberate. It opens with two vows of lifelong praise (vv. 1–2), moves to the problem praise must solve—God’s greatness is “unsearchable” (v. 3)—and then offers the solution: testimony across time (vv. 4–7). At the center sits Israel’s creedal shorthand for God’s character—“gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, abundant in kindness” (v. 8; the classic formula from Exodus 34:6)—followed by a striking expansion: “The LORD is good to all; his compassion is over all his works” (v. 9). From there the poem rises into royal language (vv. 10–13)—kingdom and dominion—and then, against ancient Near Eastern expectations, defines kingship by attentiveness to the vulnerable (vv. 14–16): upholding the fallen, feeding every creature. The poem concludes with a tight sequence on divine righteousness and nearness (vv. 17–20), and a final widening of the camera—from “my mouth” to “all flesh” (v. 21).

A few literary terms will help a modern reader hear the craft. Parallelism—the basic engine of Hebrew verse—sets two lines (poetic cola) to work in tandem: “A is so—and, what’s more, B.” The second line rarely repeats the first; it heightens it, specifies it, sometimes balances it with its complement. Inclusio—framing a poem by echoing its opening at its end—also does important work here. The psalm begins with “praise” (`tehillah`, v. 1) and ends with “my mouth shall speak the praise (`tehillat`) of the LORD” (v. 21). The “forever and ever” vow in the first line returns at the last. The whole is held in a liturgical bracket.

The Septuagint (LXX), the ancient Greek translation, preserves a short line after v. 13: “Faithful is the LORD in all his words and holy in all his works.” That sentence fits the psalm’s cadence and theology and appears in some later Hebrew witnesses. The Masoretic Text (MT), the standard Hebrew version, does not have it. Readers should at least notice how well that addition would round off the kingship stanza by tying sovereignty to reliability.

The poem’s lexicon is precise. “Unsearchable” (`ein cheqer`, v. 3), a phrase used elsewhere to mark human limits before divine wisdom (Job 5:9; 9:10; Isaiah 40:28; Proverbs 25:3), answers the question no pious person should duck: What do you say when you cannot take the measure of God? Psalm 145’s answer is not analysis but narration: you recount works, “mighty acts,” “wonders.” The verb for “pour forth” in v. 7 (`yabiu`) literally means to bubble up or gush (BDB), and elsewhere names the way days “pour out speech” in silent creation (Psalm 19:3) and how lips, wise or foolish, emit what fills them (Proverbs 15:2, 28). Memory, the psalm says, is artesian. When the reservoir of remembered goodness fills, speech must overflow.

The imagery is concrete: eyes looking in expectation (v. 15); a hand opening (v. 16). “Open hand” is a stock idiom of generosity in Deuteronomy (15:8, 11). Psalm 145 dares to apply the human obligation (“open your hand to the poor”) to God. That reversal is one reason the Talmud singled out this psalm: “Whoever recites Psalm 145 three times daily is assured a place in the world to come” (Berakhot 4b). The rabbis say it is not merely the acrostic that merits that honor; it is the line “You open your hand…,” along with the psalm’s training in regular praise.

There is polemic here, but it is gentle. Ancient Near Eastern hymns magnified a god’s power by listing conquests and favors to the king. Psalm 145 speaks royal language, even borrowing the conventional “kingdom forever” formula (v. 13 resonates with Ugaritic idioms). But its political theology is different. True sovereignty looks like this: stabilizing those who have crumpled, supplying food in season, being “near to all who call… in truth” (v. 18), and drawing a moral line that honors love and destroys entrenched wickedness (v. 20). The repeated “all” (`kol`) is the psalm’s drumbeat: all his works (v. 10), all who fall (v. 14), the eyes of all (v. 15), every living thing (v. 16), all his ways/works (v. 17), all who call (v. 18), all who love (v. 20), all flesh (v. 21). Praise is finally not a private feeling but an ecology; it binds the “I” to “all.”

To summarize the arc: Psalm 145 teaches that when faced with what you cannot fathom, you do not fall silent. You tell what you have seen, you pass it on, you bind it to the alphabet so your grandchildren can remember it, you learn the cadence of daily blessing, and you trust that this “I” will join “all flesh” in time. Praise, the psalm suggests, is a practiced courage that outlives us.
