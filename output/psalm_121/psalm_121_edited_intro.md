“I lift my eyes to the mountains; from where will my help come?” (אֶשָּׂא עֵינַי אֶל־הֶהָרִים; מֵאַיִן יָבֹא עֶזְרִי, v. 1). The opening of Psalm 121 is so familiar that it is easy to forget how odd it is. The superscription, שִׁיר לַמַּעֲלוֹת (*shir lama‘alot*, “a song of ascents”), places it among the fifteen “Songs of Ascents” (Psalms 120–134), probably associated with going *up* (עֲלִיָּה) to Jerusalem or with steps in the temple. But the scene the psalm paints is not of a pilgrim already basking in the safety of Zion. It is a moment of exposure. Someone on the road looks up at the high ridges and asks, in effect, “Where on earth is help going to come from?”

The mountains (הֶהָרִים) are deliberately multivalent. In Israelite piety, mountains are both reassuring and suspect. Zion itself is “the holy mountain” (הַר־קׇדְשׁוֹ; Psalm 2:6). Psalm 125:2 says, “יְרוּשָׁלִַם הָרִים סָבִיב לָהּ; וַיהוָה סָבִיב לְעַמּוֹ” — “Jerusalem, hills surround it; and YHWH surrounds His people.” But Deuteronomy 12:2 denounces the “high mountains and hills” (הֶהָרִים הָרָמִים וְעַל־הַגְּבָעוֹת) as sites of pagan worship. The traveler looking up cannot know whether the heights promise sanctuary or danger: fortress or bandit, Zion or Baal’s hilltop shrine.

Traditional Jewish commentators see this tension. Radak imagines “one who looks for help from afar, who ascends the mountains and lifts his eyes this way and that.” Ibn Ezra reads the psalm against the backdrop of siege or exile. Meiri says the phrase is “as on the mountains,” like soldiers posting lookouts. The question “מֵאַיִן יָבֹא עֶזְרִי” (me’ayin, “from where?”) is rhetorically pointed; BDB notes that this *me’ayin* form is used in elevated, anxious speech (as in Numbers 11:13: “מֵאַיִן לִּי בָשָׂר — Where am I to get meat?”). The pilgrim’s uncertainty is not pious make-believe; it is the lived reality of anyone who finds themselves small in a large, opaque landscape.

Verse 2 answers swiftly: “עֶזְרִי מֵעִם יְהוָה, עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ — My help is from YHWH, maker of heaven and earth.” The preposition מֵעִם (*me‘im*) is spatial: help comes not from the terrain but “from with” God, from God’s own side. The title “maker of heaven and earth” (עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ) is more than ornament. It is a compact creed. “Heaven and earth” is what rhetoricians call a *merism*—a figure where you name two extremes to imply the whole. Genesis 1:1 sets the pattern: “בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים, אֵת הַשָּׁמַיִם וְאֵת הָאָרֶץ — In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” In Psalm 121, as in Psalms 115:15, 124:8, and 134:3, the phrase becomes a liturgical title: “May you be blessed by YHWH, maker of heaven and earth” (Psalm 115:15); “Our help is in the name of YHWH, maker of heaven and earth” (Psalm 124:8); “May YHWH bless you from Zion, maker of heaven and earth” (Psalm 134:3).

Within the cluster of Songs of Ascents this formula is a thread stitching psalms together. Psalm 121:2 uses it for the individual (“my help”), Psalm 124:8 turns it into a communal confession (“our help”), Psalm 134:3 uses it as a priestly blessing at the close of the collection. Read as a sequence, the Songs of Ascents trace a movement: from the anxious question of 121, through the retrospective “Were it not for YHWH who was on our side” of 124, to the serene nocturnal liturgy of 134, in which temple servants bless YHWH at night and then bless the departing worshipers. The title “maker of heaven and earth” anchors that movement in a God whose reach is not confined to any hill or sanctuary.

The psalm’s most striking move is the sudden change of voice between verses 2 and 3. The speaker of verses 1–2 uses the first person: “I lift my eyes… my help.” Verse 3 abruptly addresses someone else: “אַל־יִתֵּן לַמּוֹט רַגְלֶךָ; אַל־יָנוּם שֹׁמְרֶךָ — He will not let your foot slip; your guardian will not slumber.” From here to the end everything is in the second person (“your foot… your guardian… you”). Many premodern and modern readers hear here a liturgical dialogue: the pilgrim voices anxiety and trust, then a priest or fellow worshiper answers with blessing. Metzudat David glosses: “It is as if one says to another, to comfort him: ‘Behold, help is good.’”

Whether we imagine a literal priest or simply the community’s answering voice, the structural effect is unmistakable. Individual trust is caught up into a communal liturgy. The figure of “your guardian” (שֹׁמְרֶךָ), introduced in verse 3, expands in verse 4 into “the guardian of Israel” (שׁוֹמֵר יִשְׂרָאֵל). The psalm oscillates between singular and collective: “your foot,” “your guardian,” then “Israel,” then “YHWH will guard you… your life… your going out and your coming in” (vv. 7–8). The implication is that no Israelite walks alone. Personal protection draws its meaning from God’s larger guardianship of the people.

The verb שָׁמַר (*shamar*) is the psalm’s refrain. It occurs six times in eight verses (twice in v. 3, once in vv. 4–5, twice in v. 7, once in v. 8): “your guardian… guardian of Israel… YHWH is your guardian… YHWH will guard you… He will guard your life… YHWH will guard your going out and your coming in.” In biblical Hebrew *shamar* means more than watching; it is the verb for keeping commandments (“שְׁמֹר אֶת־יוֹם הַשַּׁבָּת — keep the sabbath day,” Deuteronomy 5:12) and tending a charge (“לְעָבְדָהּ וּלְשָׁמְרָהּ — to work it and to keep it,” Genesis 2:15). It evokes attentive, faithful care. Here the roles are reversed: not Israel keeping God’s commands, but God keeping Israel.

The psalm piles up what we might call “totalizing” phrases. Verse 3 promises that “He will not let your foot slip” (a synecdoche for the whole journey). Verse 4 insists that the guardian of Israel “neither slumbers nor sleeps,” a double negation that probably alludes to the shocking thought, voiced in other psalms, that God might be “sleeping” on the job: “Awake! Why do You sleep, O Lord?” (Psalm 44:24). Elijah taunts Baal’s prophets with the same idea: “Call with a loud voice, for he is a god; perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened” (אוּלַי יָשֵׁן הוּא וְיִקָץ; 1 Kings 18:27). Against such myths the psalm declares: the God who made heaven and earth does not doze off.

Verses 5–6 turn to the environment. YHWH is “your shade at your right hand” (יְהוָה צִלְּךָ עַל־יַד יְמִינֶךָ): shade in the literal Near Eastern sense of relief from baking sun, and “at your right hand” in the figurative sense of a champion at your vulnerable flank. Elsewhere, Zion’s inhabitants pray, “Because He is at my right hand, I shall not be moved” (כִּי מִימִינִי בַּל־אֶמּוֹט; Psalm 16:8). Verse 6 makes the merism explicit: “By day the sun will not strike you, nor the moon by night” (יוֹמָם הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ לֹא־יַכֶּכָּה; וְיָרֵחַ בַּלָּיְלָה). Day and night here, as in Genesis 8:22 (“day and night shall not cease”), stand for the whole cycle of time. The mention of the moon is puzzling to modern readers but made sense in a world where lunacy was literally linked to the lunar cycle and the night was a time of heightened vulnerability to disease and spirits. At another level, sun and moon were major objects of worship in the ancient Near East (Deuteronomy 4:19). To say that YHWH protects you from sun and moon is to de-divinize them: they are no longer powers to fear but creatures under a greater hand.

The closing verses (7–8) carry the logic to its extreme. “YHWH will guard you from all evil (מִכָּל־רָע); He will guard your life (אֶת־נַפְשֶׁךָ). YHWH will guard your going out and your coming in (צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ) from now and forever (מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם).” “All evil” in biblical usage covers physical harm, misfortune, moral evil, and disaster; “your *nefesh*” can mean “your life” or “your very self.” The phrase “going out and coming in” is a standard merism for the whole pattern of one’s activities: “Blessed shall you be in your coming in and blessed shall you be in your going out” (בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה בְּבֹאֶךָ; וּבָרוּךְ אַתָּה בְצֵאתֶךָ; Deuteronomy 28:6). It can have a military flavor—Moses prays for a leader “who shall go out before them and come in before them” (אֲשֶׁר יֵצֵא לִפְנֵיהֶם וַאֲשֶׁר יָבֹא לִפְנֵיהֶם; Numbers 27:17)—but at its broadest it simply means “everything you undertake.” “From now and forever” appears again in Psalm 131:3: “יַחֵל יִשְׂרָאֵל אֶל־יְהוָה מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם — Let Israel hope in YHWH from now and forever.” Within the Songs of Ascents, the identical phrase frames both personal protection (Psalm 121) and communal hope (Psalm 131), reinforcing the sense of an open-ended covenantal horizon.

Because the psalm’s promises are so sweeping, Jewish tradition has treated it as a portable blessing. It is recited on journeys, after the Amidah, before sleep. Rabbinic literature already uses verse 8 as proof that God guards people’s “going out and coming in” more faithfully than any human guard. The Talmud (Menachot 33b), as quoted by Torah Temimah, contrasts a human king, who sits inside while servants guard him outside, with the Holy One, who “has His servants within, but He guards them from outside,” citing “YHWH will guard your going out and your coming in” (יְהוָה יִשְׁמָר צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ) as support. A small psalm, memorized and murmured, becomes a kind of verbal mezuzah: a reminder that the threshold you cross is watched by One who neither slumbers nor sleeps.

#### Full psalm

Psalm 121 is one of the most ubiquitous psalms in Jewish prayer, especially as a plea for protection. Many communities recite the entire psalm after the silent Amidah at weekday *Ma‘ariv* and Shabbat *Minchah*, as a concluding prayer of trust. In several Sephardic rites it appears on Motza’ei Shabbat within the “Veyiten Lekha” collection, just after Havdalah, to accompany the transition from sacred time back into the workweek. There it is recited in full, beginning: “שִׁיר לַמַּעֲלוֹת אֶשָּׂא עֵינַי אֶל־הֶהָרִים; מֵאַיִן יָבֹא עֶזְרִי… — A song of ascents: I lift my eyes to the mountains; from where will my help come?…” It also appears in some rites after the Megillah reading on Purim and in expanded morning praises (Pesukei de-Zimra) on Rosh Hashanah, underscoring the themes of divine help and guardianship at liminal moments.

#### Key verses

Verse 2, “עֶזְרִי מֵעִם יְהוָה, עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ — My help is from YHWH, maker of heaven and earth,” is used in Ashkenazic *Kaddish Shalem* as the congregation’s response to the central petition: “יְהֵא שְׁלָמָא רַבָּא מִן שְׁמַיָּא וְחַיִּים עָלֵינוּ… וְאִמְרוּ אָמֵן: עֶזְרִי מֵעִם יְהוָה, עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ — May there be abundant peace from heaven and life upon us… and say: Amen: My help is from YHWH, maker of heaven and earth.” The psalm’s private confession is thus turned into a communal acclamation after every Amidah repetition.

Verse 4, “הִנֵּה לֹא־יָנוּם וְלֹא יִישָׁן, שׁוֹמֵר יִשְׂרָאֵל — Behold, the Guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps,” features prominently in the bedtime Shema (*Keri’at Shema al ha-Mittah*). After the Priestly Blessing — “יִבָרֶכְךָ יְהוָה… יִשָּׂא יְהוָה פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ וְיָשֵׂם לְךָ שָׁלוֹם — May YHWH bless you… may YHWH lift up His face to you and grant you peace” — many rites add: “הִנֵּה לֹא יָנוּם וְלֹא יִישָׁן, שׁוֹמֵר יִשְׂרָאֵל — Behold, the Guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps.” As one relinquishes consciousness, the psalm’s line is spoken over the bed as a verbal shield.

Verse 7, “יְהוָה יִשְׁמׇרְךָ מִכָּל־רָע; יִשְׁמֹר אֶת־נַפְשֶׁךָ — YHWH will guard you from all evil; He will guard your life,” and verse 8, “יְהוָה יִשְׁמׇר צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ, מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם — YHWH will guard your going out and your coming in, from now and forever,” are widely used as blessings at thresholds. In many Sephardic homes they are recited each Friday night after *Shalom Aleichem*, paired with Psalm 91:11: “כִּי מַלְאָכָיו יְצַוֶּה לָּךְ לִשְׁמׇרְךָ בְּכָל־דְּרָכֶיךָ; יְהוָה יִשְׁמׇר צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ — For He will command His angels for you, to guard you in all your ways; YHWH will guard your going out and your coming in.” Together they frame the home’s entry as a place under angelic and divine watch.

#### Phrases

The closing half of verse 8, “יִשְׁמׇר צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם — He will guard your going out and your coming in from now and forever,” has become almost synonymous with the Traveler’s Prayer (*Tefillat ha-Derekh*). After the main petition, many siddurim add: “כִּי מַלְאָכָיו יְצַוֶּה לָּךְ לִשְׁמׇרְךָ בְּכָל דְּרָכֶיךָ; יְהוָה יִשְׁמׇר צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם.” The psalm’s promise, originally general, is focused here on literal travel.

In the *Pidyon ha-Ben* (redemption of the firstborn son) ceremony in many Sephardic communities, the kohen blesses the infant with verses from Psalm 121: “יְהוָה שֹׁמְרֶךָ; יְהוָה צִלְּךָ עַל־יַד יְמִינֶךָ… יְהוָה יִשְׁמׇרְךָ מִכָּל־רָע; יִשְׁמֹר אֶת־נַפְשֶׁךָ — YHWH is your guardian; YHWH is your shade at your right hand… YHWH will guard you from all evil; He will guard your life.” The psalm’s pilgrim becomes, in this ritual, an infant just beginning his life’s journey.
