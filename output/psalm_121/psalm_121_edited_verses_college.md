### Verse 1

**שִׁיר לַמַּעֲלוֹת; אֶשָּׂא עֵינַי אֶל־הֶהָרִים; מֵאַיִן יָבֹא עֶזְרִי׃**  
“A song for ascents. I lift my eyes to the mountains; from where will my help come?”

The title שִׁיר לַמַּעֲלוֹת (*shir la‑ma‘alot*) labels this as one of the fifteen “Songs of Ascents” used for going up—either up to Jerusalem or up the Temple steps (מַעֲלוֹת can mean “steps” in BDB). Already we’re in pilgrimage mode.

The scene is simple and cinematic: a traveler stops, looks up at the ridge line—אֶשָּׂא עֵינַי אֶל־הֶהָרִים, “I lift my eyes to the mountains”—and voices a question: מֵאַיִן יָבֹא עֶזְרִי, “from where will my help come?” The adverb מֵאַיִן (*me’ayin*) is a compact “whence?” with an undertone of doubt. It’s used in poetic, stressed contexts: “מֵאַיִן לִי בָּשָׂר” – “Where can *I* get meat?” (Num 11:13), or “מֵאַיִן כָּמוֹהוּ?” – “Where is its like?” (Jer 30:7). Here it feels like: “Is there even such a thing as help for me?”

What about “the mountains”? That’s deliberately ambiguous.

- In Israel’s landscape, mountains are tough, risky terrain. Bandits and wild animals like mountains. Paths are narrow; one slip can be fatal.
- Religiously, mountains (and the “high places” on them) were famous as cult sites—exactly the sort of thing Deuteronomy wants destroyed: “עַל הֶהָרִים הָרָמִים… וְתַחַת כָּל־עֵץ רַעֲנָן” (Deut 12:2). Other nations’ gods live on their mountains.
- And yet, *Zion* is also a mountain, “הַר־קׇדְשׁוֹ,” God’s holy hill.

Radak paints the scene like this: “כְּמוֹ הַמְצַפֶּה עֵזֶר מֵרָחוֹק… וְנוֹשֵׂא עֵינָיו אֵילָךְ וְאֵילָךְ” – “Like someone watching for help from far away, who climbs the mountains and lifts his eyes this way and that, [wondering] if help will come.” The pilgrim is not making a confident theological statement yet; he’s honestly unsure.

Compare Psalm 123:1, which starts, “אֵלֶיךָ נָשָׂאתִי אֶת־עֵינַי, הַיּוֹשֵׁב בַּשָּׁמַיִם׃” – “To You I lift my eyes, You who are enthroned in heaven.” There the direction of hope is explicit: to God. Psalm 121 delays that clarity for one verse, and that delay creates emotional tension the rest of the poem will resolve.

### Verse 2

**עֶזְרִי מֵעִם יְהוָה; עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ׃**  
“My help comes from YHWH, maker of heaven and earth.”

Verse 2 answers verse 1’s question in the tightest way possible. The very first word, עֶזְרִי (*‘ezri*, “my help”), answers מֵאַיִן יָבֹא עֶזְרִי: it comes “מֵעִם יְהוָה”—“from with YHWH.” The preposition עִם means “with, beside”; *me‘im* suggests that help flows out of being in God’s presence, not out of the landscape.

Then comes the title: עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ, “maker of heaven and earth.” As we noted in the introduction, this is a classic **merism**—naming the two poles (“heaven” and “earth”) to mean “the whole universe between them.” It’s a fixed formula that shows up at strategic points in the Psalms:

- Psalm 124:8, concluding a rescue psalm: “עֶזְרֵנוּ בְּשֵׁם יְהוָה, עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ׃” – “Our help is in the name of YHWH, maker of heaven and earth.”
- Psalm 134:3, closing the entire Songs of Ascents: “יְבָרֶכְךָ יְהוָה מִצִּיּוֹן, עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ׃”

Here the formula moves the focus from particular mountains to the Maker of all mountains. It quietly undercuts any idea that a local divine power—Baal of this hill, some astral deity of that valley—might be your best bet. If your helper is the one who created “heaven and earth,” there is no realm outside that help.

In the Songs of Ascents collection, you can see a little progression:

- Psalm 121: “עֶזְרִי מֵעִם יְהוָה…” – *my* help.
- Psalm 124: “עֶזְרֵנוּ בְּשֵׁם יְהוָה…” – *our* help.
- Psalm 134: “יְבָרֶכְךָ יְהוָה מִצִּיּוֹן…” – “May YHWH bless *you*…”

So this personal confession in 121:2 reverberates outwards into the whole community and the Temple liturgy.

### Verse 3

**אַל־יִתֵּן לַמּוֹט רַגְלֶךָ; אַל־יָנוּם שֹׁמְרֶךָ׃**  
“He will not let your foot slip; your guardian will not slumber.”

Here the voice changes. We are no longer hearing “my help”; we are addressed directly as “you” (רַגְלֶךָ, “your foot”; שֹׁמְרֶךָ, “your guardian”).

The verse uses אַל plus the imperfect verb—אַל־יִתֵּן, “He will not give [allow],” אַל־יָנוּם, “He will not slumber.” Grammatically this is a “jussive” (a verb form for wish/command), but in this context it functions as an assurance: not “may He not let your foot slip,” but “He simply isn’t going to.”

The image is very physical. לַמּוֹט comes from the root מוֹט (*mot*), “to totter, to slip, to be shaken.” The classic stability line is Psalm 15:5:

> עֹשֵׂה־אֵלֶּה לֹא יִמּוֹט לְעוֹלָם׃  
> “Whoever does these things shall never be shaken.”

And Psalm 125:1 applies it to Zion itself:  

> הַבֹּטְחִים בַּיהוָה כְּהַר־צִיּוֹן; לֹא יִמּוֹט לְעוֹלָם יֵשֵׁב׃  
> “Those who trust in YHWH are like Mount Zion: it cannot be moved; it abides forever.”

Here the mountain is dangerous and the **person** is in danger of sliding off; God prevents the slip.

שֹׁמְרֶךָ (*shomrekha*, “your guardian”) introduces the psalm’s main metaphor. A *shomer* is a guard or watchman—someone whose job is to stay awake so you can sleep. Think city watch (cf. Psalm 127:1: “אִם־יְהוָה לֹא־יִשְׁמׇר־עִיר, שָׁוְא שָׁקַד שׁוֹמֵר” – “Unless YHWH guards a city, the watchman keeps vigil in vain”). Here God is that watchman over *you*.

Medieval commentators heard verse 3 as the beginning of a speech of comfort. Radak paraphrases: “טוב הוא ששמת בטחונך בה' יתברך… כי כן יעשה” – “It is good that you have placed your trust in YHWH… for thus He will do.” Metzudat David: “כאלו אחד יאמר לחבירו דרך נחמה…” – “As if one says to his friend, to comfort him…”

So the psalm stages a liturgical counseling session: someone answers the anxious traveler, line by line.

### Verse 4

**הִנֵּה לֹא־יָנוּם וְלֹא יִישָׁן; שׁוֹמֵר יִשְׂרָאֵל׃**  
“See, the Guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps!”

The little particle הִנֵּה (*hinneh*) means “look!” or “see!” It’s like the speaker pointing with a finger: pay attention to this bit.

The line uses doubled vocabulary for sleep: נוּם (*num*, “to doze”) and יָשֵׁן (*yashen*, “to sleep”). Meiri explains, “התנומה היא שינה קלה והשינה שינה גמורה” – “slumber is light sleep and sleep is deep sleep.” It’s a kind of hendiadys (one idea expressed with two words): absolutely no dozing off on the job.

This also plays against Ancient Near Eastern ideas where gods could, in fact, be asleep, absent, or periodically dead. Elijah mocks the prophets of Baal:

> קִרְאוּ בְקוֹל גָּדוֹל… אוּלַי יִישֵׁן הוּא וְיִקָּץ׃  
> “Shout louder… maybe he is sleeping and will wake up!” (1 Kings 18:27)

Isaiah 5:27 uses similar language of the army God sends: “לֹא יָנוּם וְלֹא יִישָׁן” – “they do not slumber or sleep.” Psalm 121 takes that way of speaking and puts it straight onto God.

The second half of the verse widens the circle: “שׁוֹמֵר יִשְׂרָאֵל,” “the Guardian of Israel.” We have moved from “your guardian” (שֹׁמְרֶךָ) to the national title. The individual pilgrim’s safety is rooted in God’s long‑term, covenantal guarding of the whole people. This line became so central in Jewish consciousness that it’s embedded in several prayers. In the bedtime liturgy, you say:

> הִנֵּה לֹא יָנוּם וְלֹא יִישָׁן, שׁוֹמֵר יִשְׂרָאֵל׃  

right after the Priestly Blessing—combining God’s “face shining on you” with God’s never‑sleeping protection.

### Verse 5

**יְהוָה שֹׁמְרֶךָ; יְהוָה צִלְּךָ עַל־יַד יְמִינֶךָ׃**  
“YHWH is your guardian; YHWH is your shade at your right hand.”

This verse hits like a drumbeat: the divine name twice, parallel clauses:

- יְהוָה שֹׁמְרֶךָ – “YHWH is your guardian.”
- יְהוָה צִלְּךָ – “YHWH is your shade.”

That opening repetition is **anaphora**—starting consecutive lines with the same word or phrase to build emphasis. It’s “second‑person theology”: not “God is a guardian,” but “YHWH is **your** guardian.”

צֵל (*tzel*), “shade” or “shadow,” works on several levels:

1. **Travel realism:** In the Judean hills, shade is life‑saving. Sun without shade means heatstroke. Jonah 4:6 has God appointing a plant “לִהְיוֹת צֵל עַל־רֹאשׁוֹ” – “to be shade over his head.”
2. **Protection image:** Many psalms use God’s “shadow” as a metaphor for safety. Psalm 91:1: “בְּצֵל שַׁדַּי יִתְלוֹנָן” – “in the shadow of Shaddai he will lodge.” Psalm 17:8: “הַסְתִּירֵנִי בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ” – “hide me in the shadow of Your wings.”
3. **Intimacy:** A shadow is right next to you, always in the same shape as you. Later midrash (quoted by Torah Temimah) plays with this: just as your shadow moves when you move, God’s care responds to your actions.

“עַל־יַד יְמִינֶךָ” literally “upon/at the hand of your right [side].” The right hand (יָמִין) is the standard place of strength, fighting, and honor. Ibn Ezra and others read this as military: God positions Himself right where you’re exposed in battle, covering your weapon hand. Psalm 110:5 has, “אֲדֹנָי עַל־יְמִינְךָ” – “The Lord is at your right hand; He crushes kings…”

A beautiful rabbinic spin appears in *Menachot* 33b (brought by Torah Temimah). Human kings sit inside with guards outside. God, by contrast, lets His servants sit safely inside while He stands on watch “outside,” as it were, fulfilling “יְהוָה שֹׁמְרֶךָ; יְהוָה צִלְּךָ עַל־יַד יְמִינֶךָ׃”

### Verse 6

**יוֹמָם הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ לֹא יַכֶּכָּה; וְיָרֵחַ בַּלָּיְלָה׃**  
“By day the sun will not strike you, nor the moon by night.”

Formally, this is an example of **ellipsis**: something is left unsaid but clearly implied. The second colon lacks a verb, so you mentally fill in “will not strike you” from the first: “וְ[לֹא יַכֶּכָּה] יָרֵחַ בַּלָּיְלָה.”

We have two overlapping merisms:

- יוֹמָם / בַּלָּיְלָה – “by day / by night” = all the time.
- שֶׁמֶשׁ / יָרֵחַ – “sun / moon” = the major lights of heaven.

Genesis 8:22 does something similar: “יוֹם וָלַיְלָה לֹא יִשְׁבֹּתוּ” – “day and night shall not cease.” Psalm 55:11 says of enemies, “יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה יְסוֹבְבֻהָ עַל־חוֹמֹתֶיהָ” – “Day and night they make their rounds on its walls,” meaning constantly.

The danger from the sun is easy to grasp. The verb נָכָה (*nakah*), “to strike,” is used for physical blows and for disasters; here it’s “sunstroke.” Jonah 4:8: “וַתַּךְ הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ עַל־רֹאשׁ יוֹנָה” – “the sun beat down on Jonah’s head.” Psalm 121 promises: that will not happen to you.

But how does the **moon** strike? Ancient people associated the moon with all kinds of effects—tides of moisture in the body, mental disturbance (our word “lunatic” comes from Latin *luna*, moon). Radak, thinking in pre‑modern medicine, explains that the sun dries the body’s moisture and the moon adds too much, and both extremes cause illness. So the line means: you will be guarded from day‑heat and night‑dampness, from every sort of climate‑related disease.

There’s also theology: sun and moon were major gods in surrounding cultures (Shamash, Sin). Deuteronomy 4:19 warns Israel not to be tempted to worship “הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ וְהַיָּרֵחַ וְהַכּוֹכָבִים.” Here, those impressive lights are demoted. They can’t protect you and they won’t hurt you; the real agency belongs to YHWH, who shades you from both.

### Verse 7

**יְהוָה יִשְׁמׇרְךָ מִכָּל־רָע; יִשְׁמֹר אֶת־נַפְשֶׁךָ׃**  
“YHWH will guard you from all evil; He will guard your *nefesh* (life/self).”

This verse doubles down on the root שׁמר one last time: יִשְׁמׇרְךָ (“will guard you”), יִשְׁמֹר (“will guard”). This kind of repetition, where a word from the first colon is picked up in the second, is often called “staircase parallelism”—the second line steps up from the first.

מִכָּל־רָע (*mikkol‑ra‘*), “from all evil,” is intentionally broad. רַע covers moral wrong, harm from enemies, illness, disaster. Psalm 23:4 promises, “לֹא־אִירָא רָע, כִּי אַתָּה עִמָּדִי” – “I will fear no evil, for You are with me.” Psalm 91:10 says, “לֹא־תְאֻנֶּה אֵלֶיךָ רָעָה” – “No evil shall befall you.” Our verse joins that same network of absolute‑sounding protection.

Then the focus narrows: “יִשְׁמֹר אֶת־נַפְשֶׁךָ.” נֶפֶשׁ (*nefesh*) is a famously tricky word to translate. It can mean “life,” “soul,” “person,” even “throat” in some contexts. Here, “He will guard your nefesh” probably means more than just “your physical survival.” It’s the preservation of your essential self—your life in the deep sense, not only your body.

Meiri nicely splits the promise: “הִבְטִיחוֹ בִּשְׁמִירַת הַגּוּף וּשְׁמִירַת הַנֶּפֶשׁ” – “He assured him of protection of the body and protection of the soul.” The first colon leans toward outer threats; the second, toward the innermost you.

In Sefardi practice, these lines are recited at the Shabbat table on Saturday night, as part of a chain of verses like:

> יוֹמָם הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ לֹא יַכֶּכָּה וְיָרֵחַ בַּלָּיְלָה׃  
> יְהוָה יִשְׁמׇרְךָ מִכָּל־רָע; יִשְׁמֹר אֶת־נַפְשֶׁךָ׃  

It’s hard to think of a more comprehensive way to bless someone for the coming week.

### Verse 8

**יְהוָה יִשְׁמׇר־צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ; מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם׃**  
“YHWH will guard your going out and your coming in, from now and forever.”

The psalm ends by stretching the promise in two directions: **space/activity** and **time**.

צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ (*tsetkha u‑vo’ekha*, “your going out and your coming in”) is a classic **merism**. In Deuteronomy 28:6 the obedient Israelite is told:

> בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה בְּבֹאֶךָ; וּבָרוּךְ אַתָּה בְּצֵאתֶךָ׃  
> “Blessed shall you be in your coming in, and blessed shall you be in your going out.”

The phrase can refer very concretely to battles and campaigns—Numbers 27:17 asks for a leader “אֲשֶׁר יֵצֵא לִפְנֵיהֶם וַאֲשֶׁר יָבֹא לִפְנֵיהֶם,” “who will go out before them and come in before them”—but it easily widens to mean “all your life movements.” For our original pilgrim, it would include leaving home, arriving in Jerusalem, leaving Jerusalem, returning home; for readers in every age, it covers every threshold you cross.

On the time axis, מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם (“from now and forever”) is another merism, from this moment out into an undefined future. עוֹלָם (*‘olam*) can mean “a very long time” or “eternity” depending on context. Several psalms end with this exact phrase:

- Psalm 113:2: “יְהִי שֵׁם יְהוָה מְבֹרָךְ, מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם׃”
- Psalm 115:18: “וַאֲנַחְנוּ נְבָרֵךְ יָהּ, מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם׃”
- Psalm 125:2 (also a Song of Ascents): “וַיהוָה סָבִיב לְעַמּוֹ, מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם׃”
- Psalm 131:3: “יַחֵל יִשְׂרָאֵל אֶל־יְהוָה, מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם׃”

Psalm 131:3 is especially close: there, Israel is told to *hope* in YHWH from now and forever; here, YHWH will *guard* your going and coming from now and forever. Hope and guarding match up, two sides of the same covenant.

It’s no accident that this line is standard in the *Traveler’s Prayer* (*Tefillat HaDerech*). After asking God to lead you in peace, you often add:

> יְהוָה יִשְׁמׇר־צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ, מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם׃  

You’re basically borrowing the last verse of Psalm 121 as a compact travel blessing.

So the psalm that opened with a nervous glance at the hills closes with an all‑embracing statement: wherever you go, whenever you go, the maker of heaven and earth is your guardian.
