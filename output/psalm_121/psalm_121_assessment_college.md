The existing introduction and commentary are learned, accurate, and often insightful. They do a good job situating Psalm 121 among the Songs of Ascents, noticing the “from I to you” voice shift, the sixfold שׁמר (shamar), and the cosmic scope of “עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ.” They also connect the psalm to Ancient Near Eastern ideas about sleeping gods and astral deities, and they bring in strong traditional voices (Radak, Meiri, Metzudat David).

For a first‑year college audience, though, there are some problems:

- The tone is quite dense and academic. Technical terms (merism, hendiadys, anadiplosis, etc.) are used without always being clearly defined in plain English. A bright first‑year can handle the ideas, but the jargon needs translating.
- The structure is not very reader‑friendly. Long paragraphs and few signposts make it harder to see the overall argument: how the poem moves from anxiety to assurance.
- Some excellent material from the research bundle is only partly used. For example:
  - The “chain” of עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ in Psalms 121, 124, and 134.
  - The very rich liturgical afterlife (Kaddish, bedtime Shema, Tefillat HaDerech, Pidyon HaBen, Shabbat table) could be illustrated with Hebrew quotations to make the psalm feel “alive” in Jewish practice.
  - Torah Temimah’s midrashic use of ה׳ שֹׁמְרֶךָ, and the way rabbinic literature plays with God as “outside guard,” are barely touched.
- A few analyst questions are raised but not really answered (e.g., the relationship with Psalms 124 and 134, the implications of צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ in v. 8).
- The verse commentary, while strong, sometimes buries the main idea under too many side notes and citations.

Revisions needed: simplify the language without dumbing down the content; define all technical terms in place; break the introduction into clear subsections with headings; integrate liturgical uses with Hebrew quotations; use more concrete analogies; and make very explicit why each poetic move (mountains, feet, shade, sun/moon, going/coming) is interesting and what it contributes to the psalm’s emotional journey.
