**Verse 1**

The double “Why?”—לָמָּה רָגְשׁוּ גוֹיִם // וּלְאֻמִּים יֶהְגּוּ־רִיק—announces incredulity, not inquiry. רָגְשׁוּ (ragshu) is a rare verb for turbulent assembling (cf. Ps 55:15 בְּרָגֶשׁ, “throng”). The parallel verb הָגָה (here יֶהְגּוּ) usually marks murmuring meditation (Ps 1:2), but with רִיק (“emptiness, vanity”) it becomes the susurrus of conspiracy. Read aloud, the murmuring is audible; the cola enact a contrast between the noisy crowd (“ragshu”) and sotto voce plotting (“yehgu-riq”). The scope widens from גוֹיִם (“nations,” political units) to לְאֻמִּים (“peoples,” ethnic/cultural groupings), a classic synonymous parallelism that expands the field.

Biblical figurative patterns sharpen the verse’s charge. The “raging” of peoples is frequently likened to a stormy sea God alone can still (Psalm 65:8: “He stills the roaring of seas… and the tumult of peoples”), making the opening line a moralized meteorology: human unrest as chaos. The rabbinic imagination takes it eschatologically. In Avodah Zarah 3a the nations, having toyed with commandments, mutter precisely these words when the messianic reality dawns—and are met with divine laughter. Medieval Jewish interpreters also allow a nearer horizon: David’s early reign, with Philistine coalitions massing (2 Samuel 5:17–25), fits the scene.

Stylistically, the line models the dynamics of Hebrew parallelism (“A is so—and what’s more, B”). The second colon intensifies and specifies the first: from visible tumult to calculated scheming, and from vague unrest to the judgment “emptiness.” The poet’s rhetoric turns “Why?” into a verdict: such plotting is not only doomed; it is vacuous.

Finally, Psalm 2’s first word, “Why,” answers Psalm 1’s confident opening, אַשְׁרֵי (“Happy”). One path is thick with counsel and yields fruit in season; the other is full of muttering and ends in windblown chaff. The editorial seam between Psalms 1–2 makes v. 1 a wisdom test disguised as geopolitics.

**Verse 2**

יִתְיַצְּבוּ מַלְכֵי־אֶרֶץ // וְרוֹזְנִים נוֹסְדוּ־יָחַד: the leaders’ posture and process are telling. יִתְיַצְּבוּ (“take their stand”) evokes formal battle array (cf. 1 Sam 17:16). רוֹזְנִים (“regents/nobles”) is a title of weight (cf. Prov 8:15; Isaiah 40:23), and נוֹסְדוּ (Niphal of יסד) likely plays on סוֹד (“counsel, secret council”): “they are founded together” becomes “they conspire together,” a dark parody of constitution-making. The target is doubled: עַל־יְהוָה וְעַל־מְשִׁיחוֹ—“against YHWH and against his anointed.” The parallel prepositions make the theology explicit: to resist the Davidic king is to resist the God who installed him.

Tradition puts flesh on the line. Rashi takes the verse historically, as the Philistine “satraps” posturing as kings in their own pride; Radak notes the same. Ibn Ezra reads “nosdu” from סוֹד, reinforcing the picture of a clandestine caucus. The Talmud (Avodah Zarah 3a) globalizes the scene: the nations’ last act before judgment is to coordinate rebellion “against YHWH and against his anointed.”

Theologically, “his anointed” (מְשִׁיחוֹ) is a royal, not yet eschatological, term: the king anointed by a prophet (cf. 1 Sam 16). Later Jewish and Christian readings will hear more; the psalm’s own rhetoric insists first on the political point that the monarchy is a theological institution. The “merism” (nations/peoples → kings/regents) creates totality: revolt is comprehensive—from street to palace.

Poetically, the colon-pair moves from stance to strategy, from public posture to secret plotting. The “A is so—and what’s more, B” rhythm sets up a contrast with the divine response in vv. 4–6: while human rulers “stand” and “found” their plans, the enthroned One simply “sits” and speaks. Their posture is readiness; His is sovereign repose.

**Verse 3**

נְּנַתְּקָה אֶת־מוֹסְרוֹתֵימוֹ // וְנַשְׁלִיכָה מִמֶּנּוּ עֲבֹתֵימוֹ: the rebels’ own chant exposes the heart of revolt. The cohortatives (“let us break… let us throw”) carry volition. The nouns are doublets: מוֹסְרוֹת (from מוּסָר, “discipline, bonds”) and עֲבֹתוֹת (“thick ropes”). This is hendiadys: two near-synonyms intensify one idea—cast off all constraint. Scripture regularly uses these images for covenant violation. Israel once “broke” these bonds (Jeremiah 2:20; 5:5); here the nations dramatize the same impulse. The metaphor spills from treaty law into morality: rejecting instruction (מוּסָר) is indistinguishable from cutting a political yoke.

Medieval readers hear both dimensions. Radak ties the “bonds” to Israel’s unity under David; Malbim distinguishes “reasonable commandments” and “supra-rational decrees,” imagining the rebels determined to throw off both. The figurative-language pattern is wider: an “iron yoke” (Deut 28:48) denotes crushing oppression; “break the yoke” (Gen 27:40; Lev 26:13) means emancipation. Psalm 2 turns that stock figure on its head: the yoke they seek to shed is not tyranny but the just order of God’s rule.

The rhetoric also prepares the pivot in v. 10. “Break the bonds” (מוֹסְרוֹת) will be answered by “accept discipline” (הִוָּסְרוּ; Niphal of יסר) in the wisdom appeal. The same root that the rebels reject becomes their only hope. This is one of the psalm’s artful symmetries: political counsel escalates into covenant pedagogy—or it ends in shards.

**Verse 4**

יוֹשֵׁב בַשָּׁמַיִם יִשְׂחָק // אֲדֹנָי יִלְעַג־לָמוֹ. The psalm models spatial theology. While kings “stand” (v. 2), God “sits” (יושב) in the heavens—judicial poise rather than panic. Then, laughter. Not delight but scorn. The verb pair amplifies: שׂחק (“laugh”) broadens to לָעַג (“mock, deride”), the response Wisdom reserves for fools (Prov 1:26). Psalm 59:9 uses the same lexicon for divine superiority over the nations. This anthropomorphism troubled some readers; Radak already explains it “by way of metaphor,” as the human response to an opponent beneath contempt.

The function is rhetorical and theological. Rhetorically, it punctures the rebels’ gravitas; the laughter does what a syllogism cannot. Theologically, it affirms that no conspiracy can alter the created and covenantal order. Ancient Near Eastern texts occasionally depict divine laughter at defeated chaos; Israel’s psalm takes that trope into politics: it is not only cosmic monsters but human empires that are laughable when they shake the fist at heaven.

Liturgically, later tradition sometimes recasts the tone (e.g., in fasting-day Selichot: “יוֹשֵׁב בַשָּׁמַיִם, שְׁעֵה בָּאֵי בָאֵשׁ וּבַמָּיִם”), turning the enthroned laughter into a plea for attention. That reuse is itself a midrash: the One who scoffs at hubris listens to distress.

**Verse 5**

אָז יְדַבֵּר אֵלֵימוֹ בְאַפּוֹ // וּבַחֲרוֹנוֹ יְבַהֲלֵמוֹ. “Then he speaks to them in his anger; in his wrath he terrifies them.” The adverb אָז marks the pivot from scorn to speech, and the result of the speech is terror. Some medievals (citing 2 Kgs 11:1; Hos 13:14) read יְדַבֵּר as “he will destroy” (from דֶּבֶר, plague), but the parallelism favors literal “speak”: God’s word is itself an act. “Anger” (אַף, lit. nose) and “wrath” (חָרוֹן, burning) form a hendiadys—two terms for one consuming response. The effect verb, יְבַהֲלֵם (piel of בהל), means to panic, dismay, or throw into confusion.

The chiastic flow underlines the performative force of divine speech: word → anger → terror → blazing wrath. What word terrifies? The content is disclosed in v. 6: installation. The nations’ attempt to “cast off” becomes the occasion for God to “set in place.” The psalm’s theology of language is simple and profound: the God who speaks worlds into being enthrones kings by declaration—and unmakes conspiracies with a sentence.

**Verse 6**

וַאֲנִי נָסַכְתִּי מַלְכִּי // עַל־צִיּוֹן הַר־קׇדְשִׁי. The emphatic pronoun (ואני, “But I”) stands over against “they”: their stance is council; His is appointment. The verb נָסַכְתִּי is a jewel. In BDB and cognates it can mean “pour a libation,” “cast metal,” or “install.” The resonance is liturgical: enthronement is consecration, perhaps even imagined as poured-out oil (cf. the iconography of anointing). “My king” is possessive: the monarchy is not autonomous; it is divine property and agency.

“Zion, my holy mountain” anchors the installation in place. This is theological geography: the cosmic decree is local in Jerusalem. Psalm 3:5 will echo, “He answers me from his holy mountain.” The mountain is not magic; it is the point where earthly worship and divine kingship meet. Radak’s comment is exact: “How can they think to uproot the kingdom from the house of David when I have made him king and installed him!”

Ancient parallels help: Mesopotamian texts celebrate divine appointment of kings; Psalm 2 adds specificity—Zion—and restraint—adoption, not apotheosis. The claim is high but bounded: this king is God’s; therefore, opposition to him is opposition to God; therefore, the king is accountable to God’s word.

**Verse 7**

אֲסַפְּרָה אֶל־חֹק // יְהוָה אָמַר אֵלַי: בְּנִי אַתָּה, אֲנִי הַיּוֹם יְלִדְתִּיךָ. The speaker changes: the king reports a “decree” (חֹק), a fixed statute. “I will declare the decree” is as close as the Bible gets to a coronation formula. The content is adoption: “You are my son; today I have begotten you.” In Israel’s idiom, this is covenantal, not biological. Compare 2 Samuel 7:14 (“I will be a father to him”) and Psalm 89:27–28. The temporal “today” locates sonship at enthronement, not eternity; the king becomes “son” by office and obedience.

Medieval commentators already keep both horizons in view. Rashi takes it as Davidic and general (“head over Israel, who are called ‘my firstborn’”); Ibn Ezra observes that the line could also stretch toward the Messiah. The Talmud (Sukkah 52a) imagines a conversation in which God invites the messianic son of David: “Ask of Me,” aligning vv. 7–8 into a single divine-human exchange.

Note the editorial effect: vv. 6–7 are a double speech. In v. 6 God declares; in v. 7 the king quotes God declaring. The repetition is a legal strategy. Two witnesses establish the enthronement: the enthroner and the enthroned.

**Verse 8**

שְׁאַל מִמֶּנִּי // וְאֶתְּנָה גוֹיִם נַחֲלָתֶךָ // וַאֲחֻזָּתְךָ אַפְסֵי־אָרֶץ. The imperative “Ask” is the hinge between gift and dependence. The royal grant uses legal property terms: נַחֲלָה (hereditary portion) and אֲחֻזָּה (secure holding). The promised scope, “the ends of the earth,” is a merism for totality. Medievals read the line historically (David’s conquests; cf. 2 Sam 8 and 1 Chr 14:17) and theologically (God remains the giver; the king remains petitioner).

In biblical patterning, “ask… and I will give” is the grammar of prayer, not only of kingship (cf. Ps 2’s echo in Ps 21:5; and the rabbinic application in Sukkah 52a, where the Messiah asks only for “life,” and the answer cites “חַיִּים שָׁאַל מִמֶּךָ, נָתַתָּה לוֹ”). Psalm 2 universalizes royal petition: the extent of rule is subordinate to God’s will and invites prayerful dependence. The politics of the psalm is thus Deuteronomic at heart: blessed extension under obedience; collapse under presumption.

**Verse 9**

תְּרֹעֵם בְּשֵׁבֶט בַּרְזֶל // כִּכְלִי יוֹצֵר תְּנַפְּצֵם. The MT’s תְּרֹעֵם (from רָעַע/רעה in the rare sense “break/shatter”) is the straightforward sense in context (note the parallel verb תְּנַפְּצֵם, “you will smash/scatter”). BDB cites this verse along with Job 34:24 and Jeremiah 15:12 for the “break” meaning. The rod (שֵׁבֶט) can be both scepter and cudgel; “iron” signals unyielding strength (cf. Deut 28:48; Ps 107:16). The potter’s-vessel simile is common and pointed: pottery is useful but brittle (Isaiah 30:14; Jeremiah 19). Once shattered, it becomes shards; it cannot be put back together.

The LXX famously reads ποιμανεῖς (“you will shepherd/rule”) in the first colon, a meaning that the Greek may have derived from a different vocalization or simply from the more common sense of רעה (“shepherd”). The result shifts the image from destruction to harsh governance—still with the iron rod, still with shattering results. The New Testament quotes the LXX (Rev 2:27; 12:5; 19:15), making this verse a classic example of how textual traditions shape reception. The MT and LXX need not be enemies; they offer two facets of royal authority: legitimate rule disciplines; stubborn revolt breaks.

The psalm’s rhetoric aims the image back at v. 3. Those who would smash the “bonds” will be smashed like clay. It is a sobering symmetry.

—

**Verse 10**

וְעַתָּה מְלָכִים הַשְׂכִּילוּ // הִוָּסְרוּ שֹׁפְטֵי אָרֶץ. A sharp genre-shift: enthronement becomes wisdom exhortation. “And now, O kings, be prudent; accept discipline, judges of the earth.” “Be wise” (הַשְׂכִּילוּ) is the verb of practical intelligence; “accept discipline” (Niphal of יסר) answers “let us break the bonds” (מוֹסְרוֹת, v. 3) with a verbal echo. The ones who sought to throw off instruction are invited to receive it instead.

Rashi hears the prophet’s mercy: Israel’s prophets reprove even the nations for their good. Radak, speaking as David, insists on realism: you cannot nullify God’s work; therefore, learn and be instructed. The rhetoric turns the scene inward. Political rebellion is finally a pedagogical problem; the remedy is not annihilation but instruction—if it will be accepted.

The colon structure (A-B // B′-A′) creates a tiny chiasm: “kings… be wise // be admonished… judges.” The mirrored order brings the exhortation close to the addressees, as if to say, “This is for you.” And the temporal “And now” insists: there is still a window.

—

**Verse 11**

עִבְדוּ אֶת־יְהוָה בְּיִרְאָה // וְגִילוּ בִּרְעָדָה. The paradox is intentional. “Serve YHWH in awe” names the basic covenant posture—service and reverence. “Rejoice with trembling” yokes exuberance to fear. Medievals resolve the tension not by choosing but by holding both: rejoice that God’s rule is good; tremble at his judgment (Radak). Rabbinic practice quotes this line to regulate prayer: “In the place of joy, trembling” (Berakhot 30b). The line’s emotional intelligence is theological: joy without awe devolves into glibness; awe without joy curdles into dread.

Poetically, the second colon intensifies and complicates the first in the classic “A—and what’s more, B” pattern. The verb pair “serve/rejoice” is balanced by the noun pair “awe/trembling.” The result is a compact spirituality: obedient service; glad gravity.

**Verse 12**

נַשְּׁקוּ־בַר פֶּן־יֶאֱנַף // וְתֹאבְדוּ דֶּרֶךְ // כִּי־יִבְעַר כִּמְעַט אַפּוֹ // אַשְׁרֵי כָּל־חֹוסֵי בוֹ. The textual crux is in the first two words. Read as MT: “Kiss the son,” i.e., pay homage to the king (cf. 1 Sam 10:1; Gen 41:40–43 for court gestures; Prov 31:2 for “bar = son”). This neatly answers v. 2’s revolt “against his anointed,” and forms an inclusio with v. 7 (“You are my son”). Alternative MT-based readings take בַר as “purity” (Ps 24:4; 73:1), yielding “kiss in purity” or “embrace purity,” i.e., sincere homage. The LXX diverges: δράξασθε παιδείας, “grasp discipline,” which harmonizes with the wisdom turn of vv. 10–11. Each path yields coherent sense; the Aramaic Targum paraphrases, “Receive instruction,” revealing an early Jewish instinct to moralize the verse rather than nationalize it.

The warning is compressed: “lest he be angry and you perish in the way.” “Perish” (אבד) recalls Psalm 1’s “the way of the wicked will perish,” tying the proem together. “When his anger burns but a little” (כִּמְעַט) insists that even a short flare of wrath suffices to undo a path. The beatitude then rounds the circle: “Happy are all who take refuge in him.” Refuge (חסה) is one of the Psalter’s master metaphors for trust. The pronoun “in him” is deliberately ambiguous; it likely points to YHWH, but the literary design allows the inference that to find refuge in God includes loyal submission to the king He has installed.

Liturgically and canonically, the ashrei here answers the ashrei of Psalm 1. The two psalms open the book by assigning us a posture: meditate on instruction (Ps 1); refuse proud counsel and take refuge in God’s appointed order (Ps 2). Between muttering emptiness and blessed refuge lies the work of turning—and the psalm gives us the words for it: “So now… be wise… be instructed.”
