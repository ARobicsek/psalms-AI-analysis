# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 2

What works: The draft rightly sees Psalm 2 as staged drama with shifting voices and a movement from human plotting to divine decree. It notices semantic tensions (e.g., “shepherd” vs. “break” in v. 9), the adoption formula of v. 7, and the rhetorical paradox of “rejoice with trembling.” It introduces helpful lexical notes (ragash, nasakh, moserot/avot) and quotes a range of traditional commentators. The outline of royal theology and the attention to the psalm’s theater of voices are strong.

Main weaknesses: 
- The introduction floats at a high altitude. It needs tighter integration with Psalm 1, the editorial “gate” to the Psalter—especially the “ashrei” inclusio that binds Psalms 1–2 and sets the frame for all that follows. 
- Text-critical moments, where they matter interpretively, are underused. v. 9 (MT “break” vs. LXX “shepherd/rule”), v. 12 (נַשְּׁקוּ־בַר), and the way Revelation relies on the Greek deserve crisp treatment. 
- Sound/poetic analysis is sometimes asserted without being demonstrated. Only a few lines really benefit from phonetic or stress analysis; the rest should be trimmed. 
- The liturgical section is serviceable but can be made more concrete with quotations and clearer connections to interpretation; it should be structured as required. 
- Missed opportunities: the figurative-language parallels (e.g., bonds/yoke; potter’s ware) are noted but not leveraged to show how Psalm 2 nuances well-known biblical images; the conditional “ask” in v. 8 can be linked to the Deuteronomic theology of petition and promise. 
- Several technical terms appear without definition (e.g., inclusio, hendiadys, colon). 
- The commentary occasionally repeats the introduction and does not always show how each verse advances the psalm’s argument.

Specific revisions needed:
- Add the Psalm 1–2 seam; define core terms; integrate crucial MT/LXX differences at vv. 9 and 12; use figurative-language database with precise citations (e.g., Jer 2:20; Isa 30:14; Deut 28:48; Prov 1:26; Ps 59:9). 
- Show, briefly and precisely, where sound matters (e.g., v. 1 muttering “yehegu-riq”). 
- Restructure the liturgical section with required headings; add Hebrew quotations supplied in the bundle.
- In the verse notes, connect the idioms to patterns across Scripture and state how that pattern sharpens this psalm’s distinctive use.

Figurative Language Assessment: The draft names several figures but rarely cites specific parallels with chapter:verse and usage patterns. The revision will supply these (e.g., “break bonds”: Jer 2:20; 5:5; “iron yoke”: Deut 28:48; “potter’s ware”: Isa 30:14; Jer 19; “laughter”: Prov 1:26; Ps 59:9), and then explain how Psalm 2’s use is distinctive—turning political rebellion into a textbook case of covenant fracture and fragility.
