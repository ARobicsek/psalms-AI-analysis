## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (10)

1. How does the specific Hebrew term 'mashiach' (anointed) in verse 2 relate to later messianic interpretation, and what did it signify in its original royal context?
2. What is the precise meaning of 'hayom yelidtikha' (today I have begotten you) in verse 7, and how does this adoption language function within Ancient Near Eastern royal ideology?
3. How do the Ugaritic parallels of divine sonship illuminate the theological boundaries that distinguish Israelite royal ideology from Canaanite divine kingship?
4. What is the significance of the geographical reference to Zion as 'har-qodshi' (My holy mountain) in establishing the theological geography of divine rule?
5. How does the shift from perfect tense verbs in the divine decree section (vv. 4-6) to imperfect/modal verbs in the promise section (vv. 8-9) affect the psalm's temporal perspective?
6. What is the meaning of the difficult phrase 'nashqu-var' (pay homage in good faith/kiss the son) in verse 12, and how do textual variants affect interpretation?
7. How does the imagery of breaking 'moseroteimo' and 'avoteimo' (their bonds/cords) in verse 3 relate to Ancient Near Eastern treaties and suzerainty language?
8. What role does divine laughter (yischaq) in verse 4 play in the psalm's theology, and how does this anthropomorphic language function rhetorically?
9. How does the universal scope of the promised inheritance ('aphsey-aretz' - limits of the earth) in verse 8 relate to the historical limitations of Davidic kingship?
10. What is the relationship between serving YHWH 'be-yir'ah' (in awe) and rejoicing 'bir'adah' (with trembling) in verse 11, and how does this paradox function theologically?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (7)

1. Why does the divine response begin with laughter rather than immediate anger or action?
2. What is the significance of the specific verb 'nasakhti' (poured out/installed) for royal appointment rather than more common coronation terminology?
3. How does the temporal marker 'hayom' (today) in the divine sonship formula relate to historical coronation ceremonies vs. eternal divine decree?
4. Why does verse 9 use shepherd terminology ('tero'em') for harsh military rule - is this ironic subversion or semantic range?
5. What explains the textual difficulty of 'nashqu-var' in verse 12, and how do different solutions affect the psalm's conclusion?
6. How does the paradox of 'rejoicing with trembling' (v.11) function theologically - simultaneous emotions or dialectical response?
7. Why does the universal scope promised in verse 8 require the king to 'ask' rather than receive automatically?
