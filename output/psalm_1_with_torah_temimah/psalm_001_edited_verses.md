**Verse 1**

`Ashrei ha’ish` opens the Psalter with a wisdom beatitude: “Happy/fortunate is the person.” The line then advances by sound and step: `lo halakh… lo amad… lo yashav`—three “not”s (`lo`) followed by `walk/stand/sit`. The anaphora (repeating the same opener) and the repeated l-sounds create an audible guardrail; the verbs enact a staircase of entanglement. One begins “walking in the counsel of the wicked” (`resha’im`)—borrowing outlook. Then one “stands in the path of sinners” (`chatta’im`)—lingering where patterns form. Finally, one “sits in the seat (`moshav`) of scoffers” (`letsim`)—making a home among cynics.

The nouns intensify the scene. `Resha’im` are the wicked in the active sense; `chatta’im` are those missing the mark, the habitual offenders. The climax is `letsim`, a term the book of Proverbs makes infamous: the `lets` is “proud and haughty” (Proverbs 21:24), resists reproof (9:7–8; 13:1), and “delights in scorning” (1:22). This is not a sharp-witted satirist; it is the person who has made contempt a vocation. `Moshav` can be a literal seat or an “assembly/dwelling-place” (BDB; cf. Psalm 107:32). The verse’s moral geography is architectural: advice becomes a street; a street becomes a neighborhood; the neighborhood becomes your address.

The Greek translators render the last phrase, famously, as “the seat of pestilence” (καθέδρα λοιμῶν). No Hebrew manuscript reads “pestilence” here; the LXX likely reads the Hebrew metaphorically, converting scoffing into something infectious. The effect is to warn not only of moral decline but of social contagion. Either way, the artistry lies in showing corruption as drift: not a sudden crash but a slow settling-in.

Note how “path/way” (`derek`) enters here; it will return in v. 6, creating an inclusio (a frame) that seals the psalm. The line’s terse parallelism uses the dynamics of “A is so, and what’s more, B”: walk—stand—sit moves from transient contact to settled identity. The best prophylactic, we will learn in v. 2, is a counter-practice that fills the mouth and the day.

Definitions:
- Anaphora: repeating a word/phrase at the start of successive lines.
- LXX: Septuagint, the ancient Greek translation, often interpretive.
- Inclusio: framing a unit by repeating a key term at start and end.

**Verse 2**

The hinge `ki im` (“but rather”) shifts from negation to practice. The blessed person “delights” (`ḥefetz`) in the `torat YHWH`—“the instruction of the LORD”—and `yehgeh` in it “day and night.” Two details matter.

First, the verb `yehgeh` does not denote silent, abstract thought. BDB glosses “murmur, utter, muse.” Lions `yehgeh` (Isaiah 31:4); the righteous mouth `yehgeh` wisdom (Psalm 37:30). Joshua 1:8 instructs the leader to `yehgeh` on Torah “day and night” so as to “do” all that is written. The LXX uses μελετᾶν, a verb that can mean “practice, rehearse.” In other words, the psalm describes voiced rehearsal—an embodied discipline of reciting and ruminating until the words stick.

Second, the pronouns shift: from “the Torah of the LORD” (`torat YHWH`) to “his Torah” (`torato`). The tradition caught the significance: at first it is God’s Torah; after toil, it becomes “his” (Avodah Zarah 19a). The psalm has no patience for passive piety. Delight (`ḥefetz`) is appetite that generates habit; habit turns borrowed speech into owned speech.

“Day and night” is a merism: a way of saying “always.” It does not require ceaseless reading so much as a steady rhythm that saturates the day. Psalm 119, a later meditation on Torah, will sing variations on this theme. Exodus 13:9 envisions “the Torah of the LORD in your mouth”—a striking convergence with our verse’s emphasis on voiced meditation.

Definition:
- Merism: naming extremes (day/night) to indicate totality.
- BDB: standard Hebrew lexicon recording meanings and usage.

**Verse 3**

Now the image: “He shall be like a tree `shatul` (transplanted/planted) by `palgei mayim` (channels/streams of water).” Both nouns are precise. `Shatul` (BDB) often marks deliberate setting in a chosen place (cf. Jeremiah 17:8; Psalm 92:13–14). `Palgei` are not a single river but divided runnels—the vocabulary of irrigation (BDB “divide/channel”). The righteous life is not a lucky accident beside a brook; it is cultivated nearness to a managed source.

Three clauses unpack the image with the force of concrete poetry:
- “That gives its fruit in its season” (`be’ito`). This resists fantasies of nonstop output. Ancient agricultural wisdom knew that off-season fruit is poor. A Torah-shaped person learns seasons—presence in crisis, rest without guilt, action when the time is ripe.
- “Its leaf does not wither” (`lo yibbol`). The verb `nabel` (“wither, fade”) is Isaiah’s word for grass and flowers that fail (Isaiah 40:7–8). Ezekiel’s trees by the temple river do “not wither” (47:12). Our psalm locates similar durability not at Zion’s temple but by Torah’s channels—a portable river.
- “All he does `yatsliah`.” The verb denotes success in the sense of achieving the proper end, not getting rich by default. It is the Joseph verb (Genesis 39:3): God makes his work succeed. The LXX’s κατευοδόω (“be prospered along the way”) nicely preserves the sense of a road that goes through.

Parallels deepen the texture. Jeremiah 17:8 describes the person who trusts in the LORD as a tree that “does not fear when heat comes.” The cousin image in Psalm 36:9—“You give them drink from the river of your delights”—shifts the source to God’s generosity but keeps water as life. At the other end, Psalm 119:136 uses “streams of water” (`palgei mayim`) for tears—a hyperbolic flip of our verse’s refreshment: channels can irrigate or weep, depending on whether Torah is kept.

Definition:
- Inclusio: this verse sits between “way” (v. 1) and “way” (v. 6), the frame that defines where such a tree “walks.”

**Verse 4**

“Not so the wicked—`lo ken`.” The poet withholds elaboration and offers only eleven Hebrew words. Where the righteous enjoy a layered image, the wicked are granted brevity—because there is less to say. They are “like chaff” (`mots`) that the wind (`ruach`) “drives” (`tiddfennu`) away. The verb (BDB: `nadaph`) is vigorous—drive, push, scatter—not a light, playful breeze. The point is not merely that evil is impermanent; it is insubstantial.

The chaff comparison is widely used for those God defeats. Psalm 35:5: “Let them be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the LORD driving them.” Psalm 83:14: “Make them like thistledown, like stubble before the wind.” Isaiah 41:2 pictures hostile kings scattered like chaff. In those contexts, the image functions as a wish for enemies. Here it functions as diagnosis: a life detached from divine instruction is already weightless. The metaphor’s frequency clusters in judgment scenes; Psalm 1 relocates the judgment to character itself.

There may be a hint of double meaning in `ruach`, “wind/spirit.” While the line does not explicitly name God as agent, biblical poetry often lets divine breath do the work of winnowing. Either way, the contrast with v. 3 is pointed: where the tree has roots and a managed source, chaff has no root and is at the mercy of whatever gust happens along.

Definition:
- Simile: an explicit comparison (“like chaff”) that transfers qualities (lightness, worthlessness) from one domain to another.

**Verse 5**

“Therefore” (`al ken`) draws a consequence: “the wicked will not `yakumu` in the judgment, nor sinners in the `adat tsadiqim`—the assembly of the righteous.” `Yakumu` has the range “arise/stand/endure.” The forensic setting is clear (`ba-mishpat`): when the time comes for weighing, the wicked lack standing—literally. The ambiguity fits the poem’s scope. This can be read as a present moral reality (hollow lives cannot endure scrutiny) and as eschatological (at God’s decisive judgment, they will not stand).

The second colon answers v. 1 in reverse. Once you “sat” (`yashav`) in the `moshav` of scoffers; now you cannot stand among the assembly of the righteous. The poem’s internal logic moves from location to community to destiny. The noun `edah` (BDB) often denotes a purposeful congregation with covenant overtones (e.g., “the congregation of Israel”). The LXX reads “counsel (βουλή) of the righteous,” echoing v. 1’s “counsel of the wicked.” That echo makes the symmetry even tighter: you began by borrowing advice from the wrong circle; you end excluded from the counsel of the right one.

Traditional Jewish readers split the timing. Radak hears “day of judgment” as the day of death; others hear a broader eschatological horizon. The psalm sustains the tension. It is less interested in timelines than in trajectories. A way of life that cultivates substance can endure testing; a way that cultivates scorn cannot.

Definitions:
- Forensic/judicial setting: the language of standing in court, examination, verdict.
- LXX nuance: “counsel” for “assembly” spotlights the communal mind one belongs to.

**Verse 6**

Everything rests on the theology of this final couplet: “For the LORD `yada`—knows—the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.” In biblical Hebrew, `yada` is not bare cognition. It names chosen regard and sustaining attention: “You only have I `yada` of all the families of the earth” (Amos 3:2); “I `yada` you in the wilderness” (Hosea 13:5). Here the object is a “way” (`derek`), not simply a person—a patterned life God takes note of and preserves.

The second colon is the poem’s most theologically subtle line. No agent is named for the wicked; the verb is intransitive: “the way… perishes” (`to’ved`). Evil is not a solid counter-thing that God must smash. It is a path that resolves into nothing, the moral equivalent of chaff. The antithetic parallelism—knowing/preserving versus perishing—sharpens the choice without melodrama. The inclusio closes: `derek` (“way”) appeared in v. 1, where the blessed refused “the path of sinners”; it returns here to underline that Psalm 1 is about roads and where they lead.

Canonically, the verse also bridges to Psalm 2, where the “way” of mutinous nations is also doomed, while those who “take refuge” are called `ashrei` (2:12). Together they sketch two maps: Microscopic (a person’s habits) and macroscopic (a world’s politics) governed by one logic—divine regard sustains; deracinated revolt ends in wind.

Definitions:
- Antithetic parallelism: a line-pair where the second contrasts the first, sharpening meaning.
- Inclusio: the return of “way” at the end, echoing the beginning.

In sum: Psalm 1 does not promise the untroubled life; it offers a rooted one. Its counsel is concrete—fill your mouth and your hours with the voiced rehearsal of a text until it becomes your own. Plant yourself by channels. In time, the leaves hold, and the fruit comes when it should.
