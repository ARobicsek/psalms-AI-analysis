## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (8)

1. What is the specific progression and intensification in the threefold negative actions of v. 1 (counsel->path->seat), and how does this relate to Ancient Near Eastern wisdom traditions?
2. How does the tree imagery in v. 3 compare to similar metaphors in Ancient Near Eastern literature, particularly regarding the 'streams of water' and seasonal fruitfulness?
3. What is the theological significance of 'day and night' meditation in v. 2, and how does this relate to later Jewish practices of Torah study?
4. How does the chaff metaphor in v. 4 connect to biblical harvest imagery and eschatological judgment themes elsewhere in Scripture?
5. What does 'the LORD knows the way of the righteous' mean theologically in v. 6 - is this intimate care, surveillance, or covenant recognition?
6. How do the verbal tenses and moods throughout the psalm contribute to its rhetorical force and theological claims?
7. What is the significance of the judicial language in v. 5 ('will not stand in judgment'), and how does this relate to actual legal proceedings in ancient Israel?
8. How does the absence of explicit liturgical markers affect our understanding of the psalm's original function and setting?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (7)

1. Why does the psalm use the specific verb progression הָלַךְ→עָמָד→יָשָׁב (walk→stand→sit) - is this temporal progression or intensification of involvement?
2. What is the significance of switching from 'Torah of the LORD' to 'his Torah' in verse 2 - stylistic variation or different referent?
3. Why does the tree metaphor emphasize 'streams of water' (פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם) rather than natural water sources - does this suggest human cultivation effort?
4. What does יֶהְגֶּה really mean in the context of Torah study - vocal murmuring, mental meditation, or memorization practice?
5. Is the 'judgment' in verse 5 a present moral reality or future eschatological event, and what is the 'assembly of the righteous'?
6. What does divine 'knowing' (יוֹדֵעַ) of the righteous way mean theologically - omniscience, covenant care, or elective choice?
7. Why is the destruction of the wicked described passively (תֹּאבֵד) while divine knowledge is active - theological statement about evil's nature?
