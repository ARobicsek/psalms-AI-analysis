# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 1

What works: The draft rightly treats Psalm 1 as a threshold text and foregrounds practice—“meditation” not as quiet musing but as voiced, bodily engagement. It also makes helpful lexical distinctions (e.g., `letsim` as hardened scoffers; `yatsliah` as “to succeed in the sense of reaching the proper end”). The introduction lays out the poem’s contrast of tree and chaff with clarity, and the commentary connects “day and night” to Joshua 1:8, a crucial parallel.

What needs repair: The essay misses the canonical pairing with Psalm 2—the two psalms form a gateway (note the “ashrei/happy” frame: Psalm 1:1; 2:12). There is little attention to sound and structure: the triple `lo` (“not”) and the l-sibilants in v. 1 create sonic pressure; the psalm also uses inclusio (“way,” `derek`, v. 1/6) and merism (“day and night”) that deserve explicit definition for lay readers. The LXX is barely used; in v. 1 its “seat of pestilence” (καθέδρα λοιμῶν) for “seat of scoffers” is an interpretive move worth discussing. The forensic language in v. 5 is treated only generally; the semantic range of `yakumu` (“arise/stand, endure”) can be tightened, and the MT/LXX nuance in v. 5 (“counsel/assembly”) is instructive. Figurative parallels (Jeremiah 17:8; Ezekiel 47:12 for the tree; Psalm 35:5; 83:14; Isaiah 41:2 for chaff) should be cited and compared, not only observed. Terms like inclusio, merism, colon, LXX, and BDB need brief definitions.

Specific revisions to make:
- Add the Psalm 1–2 “double-door” argument and show how Torah (Ps 1) and kingship (Ps 2) frame the Psalter.
- Integrate sound analysis (the three `lo`s; the staircase effect of `walk/stand/sit`).
- Treat `palgei mayim` as irrigation channels (BDB) and relate to ancient cultivation; compare Jer 17:8 and Ezek 47:12.
- Use the LXX where it sharpens meaning (v. 1 pestilence; v. 2 μελετᾶν as “practice/rehearse”; v. 5 “βουλή δικαίων”).
- Expand the forensic scene in v. 5 and the covenantal sense of `yada` (“know”) in v. 6 with Amos 3:2; Hosea 13:5.
- Define technical terms in-line. 

The figurative language database is underused. The revised version should cite and analyze patterns (e.g., chaff in Ps 35:5; 83:14; Isa 41:2; streams in Ps 36:9; 119:136), showing how Psalm 1’s images function distinctively as orientation rather than prayer.
