The Psalter begins not with a prayer but with a portrait. Psalm 1 stands at the threshold as a kind of moral and spiritual map. Its opening word, `ashrei`—“happy,” “fortunate,” “on the good way”—is not an emotion so much as a verdict: here is what well-ordered life looks like. The psalm invites you to imagine a life that resists drift and cultivates depth, not by accident but through practice.

Two features orient us immediately. First, the poem is built on a dynamic of contrast—the righteous and the wicked—but that contrast is more than moral sorting. It is a study in stability versus weightlessness. The righteous becomes like a well-sited tree; the wicked, chaff; the former endures judgment, the latter cannot even stand. Second, this psalm is deliberately coupled with Psalm 2. Together they form a two-door vestibule to the Psalter: Psalm 1 exalts Torah—divine instruction; Psalm 2 exalts the Lord’s anointed and the sovereignty God asserts over the nations. Both end with `ashrei` (1:1; 2:12), enclosing the gateway with the same word of flourishing. Torah-shaped meditation (Psalm 1) and refuge in the king whom God installs (Psalm 2) are not rival claims but paired coordinates for reading the next 148 poems.

Psalm 1 is often described as “wisdom.” That is fair as long as we define our terms. Wisdom here does not mean aphorisms; it means an art of living under God’s instruction. The psalm’s artistry is concise. Hebrew poetry works by parallel lines (each line-pair is a “colon,” a linked unit), and by compact images that do the heavy lifting. Two structural devices frame Psalm 1: inclusio—the poem begins and ends with “way” (`derek`): the way you avoid (v. 1), the way God “knows” (v. 6); and merism—a totality expressed through poles, as in “day and night,” meaning “always” (v. 2).

The opening verse is all motion and sound: `lo halakh… lo amad… lo yashav`—“did not walk… did not stand… did not sit.” The triple `lo` (“not”) hammers out an anaphora (a repeated opener) that feels like a guardrail. The sequence is not mere stylistic variety. It traces increasing entanglement: from walking “in the counsel of the wicked,” to standing “in the path of sinners,” to sitting “in the seat (`moshav`) of scoffers.” `Moshav` can be a literal seat or a community—an “assembly” (BDB). The company you keep becomes the house you live in. The Greek translators (LXX, the ancient Greek Bible) render that final phrase, strikingly, as “the seat of pestilence” (καθέδρα λοιμῶν), turning scoffing into contagion. That is not a different Hebrew text so much as an interpretation: scorn spreads.

The hinge of the psalm comes quickly: `ki im`—“but rather” (v. 2). The person who lives well delights (`ḥefetz`) in the `torat YHWH`—the “instruction of the LORD”—and `yehgeh` in it “day and night.” `Yehgeh` is a wonderfully concrete verb (BDB: “murmur, utter, muse”). Lions `yehgeh` over prey (Isaiah 31:4). The righteous person voices Torah to himself. This is not silent reading but a kind of rehearsed speech. The Greek meletaō (“meditate/practice”) in the LXX confirms the sense of steady rehearsal. The phrase “day and night” is a merism: everything in between belongs to this practice. Joshua 1:8 uses the same language: “You shall `yehgeh` on this Torah day and night.” The psalm also plays with pronouns: “the Torah of the LORD” becomes “his Torah” (`torato`)—a move the rabbis hear as appropriation: labor in it until it becomes yours (Avodah Zarah 19a).

Then comes the image, as vivid as it is economical: “He shall be like a tree `shatul`—transplanted—by `palgei mayim`, channels of water” (v. 3). `Palgei` are not wild streams but divided runnels—irrigation channels (BDB). The image is cultivation, not chance. The tree gives fruit “in season” (`be’ito`)—no forced productivity—and its leaf “does not wither” (`lo yibbol`). The verb `nabel` (“wither”) is Isaiah’s word for the grass that dries and flowers that fall (Isaiah 40:7–8); in Ezekiel’s river-vision, the trees by the waters “do not wither” (Ezekiel 47:12). A close parallel to our psalm is Jeremiah 17:8, where the one who trusts in the LORD is “like a tree planted by water,” not anxious in drought. Psalm 1’s last line—“all that he does `yatsliah`”—has been misread as a pledge of unbroken luck. The verb means “to succeed” in the sense of reaching the right end. It is used of Joseph: “the LORD made all he did `yatsliah`” (Genesis 39:3). The point is alignment: when habit and instruction form a character, deeds tend to hit their mark.

The contrast is abrupt, almost disdainful: “Not so the wicked—`lo ken`—but like chaff” (`mots`) the wind drives (`tiddfennu`) away (v. 4). The verb suggests force, not a gentle breeze (BDB: “drive asunder”). Chaff is the weightless husk left after threshing; it is a biblical trope for futility. Elsewhere enemies are wished to be “like chaff before the wind” (Psalm 35:5; cf. Psalm 83:14; Isaiah 41:2). Psalm 1 uses the image not as a curse but as an anthropology: a life without rooted practice has no ballast.

The tone turns judicial in v. 5: “Therefore (`al ken`) the wicked will not `yakumu` in the judgment.” `Yakumu` can mean “arise,” “stand,” or “endure.” The ambiguity is apt. Such people have nothing to stand on when weighed. The parallel clause—“nor sinners in the `adat tsadiqim`—assembly of the righteous”—reverses v. 1: the one who once sat (`yashav`) in the `moshav` of scoffers now cannot belong among the upright. The LXX, interestingly, has “nor sinners in the counsel (βουλή) of the righteous,” echoing v. 1’s “counsel of the wicked.” Whether “assembly” or “counsel,” the idea is the same: a life ordered by God’s instruction has a community; a life ordered by scorn ends alone.

The final line grounds the whole: “For the LORD `yada`—knows—the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish” (v. 6). `Yada` in Hebrew is not mere information. It is covenantal regard and sustaining attention: “You only have I `yada` of all the families of the earth,” says God (Amos 3:2); “I `yada` you in the wilderness” (Hosea 13:5). God “knowing” the righteous way means God attends to and preserves it. The wicked way, by contrast, collapses on its own: the verb is intransitive—“perishes.” Evil is not a rival substance to be crushed but a path without future.

If the Psalter is a long conversation between God and the human soul, Psalm 1 explains how to enter the conversation. It is not a prayer, yet it tells you how prayer will work: as the disciplined rehearsal of divine speech until it becomes “your Torah,” shaping perception, desire, and action. The rest of the Psalms will cry out, argue, and praise. Psalm 1 whispers at the door: begin with a practice that plants you by water.
