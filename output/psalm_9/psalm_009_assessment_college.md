# Editorial Assessment (College Edition) - Psalm 9

What’s strong: The draft sees the central tension of Psalm 9 clearly: it opens like a thank‑you but turns into a plea. It highlights the name theme (שֵׁם), the “gates” imagery, the Zion line, and the not‑quite‑finished acrostic with Psalm 10. It also quotes Hebrew well and uses classical commentary broadly (Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Radak, Malbim, Meiri).

What needs revision for first‑year students: 
- Some claims need correction or tightening. For example, הִגָּיוֹן (higgaion) does not “appear only here in the Psalter”; it occurs also in Psalm 19:15 and 92:4—what’s unique here is “Higgaion. Selah.” together. 
- Technical terms (perfect, jussive, inclusio, hendiadys, Niphal, etc.) are used without immediate plain‑English definitions. For a first‑year student, define terms the moment you use them.
- The introduction sometimes tells rather than shows. We should demonstrate patterns with Hebrew lines and short translations, and add concise explanations (e.g., what a “colon” is).
- The argument could be clearer about how Psalm 9 and Psalm 10 interlock alphabetically, and why that matters.
- The liturgical section is informative but needs cleaner structure, concrete Hebrew quotations of the prayers, and brief explanations of when/where those prayers occur.
- Verse notes sometimes assume too much background (e.g., “vocative he”) and could better explain why a given reading is interesting or meaningful.
- There’s an opportunity to integrate Torah Temimah’s midrash on לשאולה (v.18) and to correct/clarify LXX moments (e.g., מוֹרָה → νομοθέτης “lawgiver”).

Action plan:
- Reframe the introduction for clarity and curiosity, with crisp definitions and concrete examples (quote key Hebrew phrases and translate).
- Add a polished liturgical section with subheadings, Hebrew quotes, and plain descriptions of each service context.
- In each verse, start with punctuated Hebrew; then define any technical term on the spot; explain “why this matters”; show cross‑refs (quote Hebrew + English); and fold in traditional voices briefly but meaningfully.
- Correct factual slips (higgaion usage). 
- Keep the tone lively, teacherly, and precise—like a favorite professor explaining a puzzle over coffee.
