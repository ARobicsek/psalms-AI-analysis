# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 9

What works: The draft rightly sees Psalm 9 as a rhetorical hinge between thanksgiving and lament. It highlights the psalm’s “name” theology, the gate imagery, the reversal motif (the trapper caught), and the pedagogical force of the closing “enosh” lines. It also traces the alphabetic scaffolding shared with Psalm 10 and situates Zion as a theological, not merely geographical, center. Many traditional voices (Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Radak, Meiri, Malbim) are engaged with care.

What needs revision: Two chronic gaps diminish the piece. First, the commentary too often cites parallels and liturgical usages without quoting the Hebrew; intelligent readers need to see the text. Second, a number of technical terms go undefined (acrostic, colon, jussive), which raises the barrier of entry. A few claims would benefit from sharper evidence and contrast—e.g., more precise treatment of “higgaion” with its other occurrences (Ps 19:15; 92:4), and clearer handling of “morah” vs. “moreh” and the Septuagint’s “lawgiver.” The acrostic relationship to Psalm 10 is noted but not actually demonstrated on the page. The liturgical section is helpful but should include Hebrew quotations from the prayers themselves and succinct reflections on how liturgical use reframes verses. 

Missed opportunities: The Torah Temimah’s materials (e.g., Sanhedrin 105a on “yashuvu resha‘im li-she’olāh”; Sotah 48b on “שיתה ה׳ מורה להם”) deserve integration. The figurative language database invites direct quotation: for example, Proverbs 26:27 and Psalm 7:16 (both “pit” imagery) should be cited in Hebrew and English to show the pattern. The relation between “knowing Your name” (v. 11) and nations “knowing they are enosh” (v. 21) can be brought into a single, clarifying frame (covenant knowing vs. creaturely knowing). 

Stylistically, the tone is mostly measured, but tightening and clarifying some academic phrasing will help. The revised version below corrects these issues: it defines terms, quotes Hebrew copiously, answers the answerable macro-questions, integrates liturgy with Hebrew texts, and deepens the comparative and structural analysis.
