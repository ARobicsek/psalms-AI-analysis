    "Name theology threaded throughout: God's name to be praised (v. 3), enemies' names blotted (vv. 6-7), knowing God's name = trust (v. 11) - creates identity binary between remembered and forgotten",
    "Spatial theology: Gates of death (v. 14) vs. gates of Zion (v. 15) creates existential binary; Zion as geographical center of divine justice (v. 12); divine 'face/presence' causes destruction (v. 4) and judgment (v. 20)",
    "Inclusio patterns: 'at/in Your presence' (mipanekha v. 4 / al-panekha v. 20); testimony vow (v. 2 'I will tell') → fulfillment (v. 15 'so that I may tell'); wonders frame (v. 2 start, v. 17 divine self-revelation as wonder)",
    "Social class terminology accumulates: dakh (crushed, v. 10), aniyim (afflicted, vv. 13, 19), evyon (needy, v. 19) - creates constituency for divine justice claims",
    "Enosh (mortal human) wordplay in vv. 20-21 - climactic anthropological framing about creatureliness vs. hubris, recalls Genesis/Babel themes",
    "Reversal/poetic justice concentrated in vv. 16-17 with Higgaion Selah marking as meditation point - evil's self-defeating nature is theodicy's center",
    "Acrostic structure (incomplete) suggested by opening letters but not sustained - possible theological significance of incompleteness matching incomplete justice?",
    "'Forever' language (le-olam, la-netzach) used contrastively: God eternal (v. 8), enemies destroyed forever (v. 6), but 'not forever' shall afflicted be forgotten (v. 19) - temporal complexity",
    "Double imperatives/calls to action: v. 2 (praise + tell), v. 3 (rejoice + sing), v. 12 (sing + declare), v. 14 (mercy + see), v. 20-21 (rise + set fear) - creates rhetorical urgency"

  "interesting_questions": [
    "What does the enigmatic superscription 'עַל־מוּת לַבֵּן' (almuth labben) mean, and why did even ancient translators (LXX) struggle to interpret it?",
    "Why does the psalm use 'אֱנוֹשׁ' (enosh - mortal/frail human) in vv. 20-21 rather than 'אָדָם' (adam - humanity) or 'אִישׁ' (ish - man)? Is this deliberate wordplay emphasizing creaturely mortality?",
    "What is the significance of 'הִגָּיוֹן סֶלָה' (Higgaion Selah) appearing uniquely in v. 17 at the reversal motif climax? Musical notation, meditation instruction, or theological marker?",
    "How does the psalm's acrostic structure (if intentional but incomplete) relate to its theological content about incomplete justice?",
    "Why the tension between past-tense claims of completed enemy destruction (vv. 6-7 'forever,' 'no more') and urgent present-tense petitions for God to judge enemies (vv. 20-21)?",
    "What is the relationship between 'knowing God's name' (v. 11) and nations 'knowing they are enosh' (v. 21) - are these different epistemologies (covenant intimacy vs. forced recognition)?",
    "How does 'bat-Tziyon' (daughter Zion, v. 15) function - as geographical location, personified city-as-woman, or theological symbol of covenant community?",
    "Why do both legal terms 'מִשְׁפָּט' (mishpat) and 'דִּין' (din) appear together in v. 5? Are these synonyms for emphasis or distinct aspects of justice?",
    "What does the reversal motif in v. 16 (nations trapped in own devices) suggest about divine justice - immanent moral consequences or direct divine intervention?",
    "How does Zion theology (v. 12 'dwelling in Zion') relate to universal judgment claims (v. 9 'judges world') - is Zion cosmic center or particular sanctuary?",
    "What is the significance of the LXX translating 'מוֹרָה' (morah - fear/terror) as 'νομοθέτης' (lawgiver) in v. 21? Does this reflect different understanding of divine pedagogy?",
    "Why does v. 19's 'not forever shall needy be forgotten' seem to acknowledge current divine inaction/forgetfulness, contradicting vv. 8-9's eternal throne of justice?",
    "How do the 'gates' metaphors function spatially and theologically - are sha'arei mavet (gates of death) and sha'arei bat-Tziyon (gates of daughter Zion) literal, metaphorical, or cosmological?",
    "What is the function of the causative 'כִּי' clauses throughout (vv. 5, 11, 13, 19) - do they provide genuine reasons or rhetorical justifications for petition?",
    "Why does the psalm end on petition + Selah rather than resolution or praise - is this liturgical strategy or theological statement about ongoing theodicy struggle?"
