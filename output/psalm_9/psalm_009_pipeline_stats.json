      "What is the meaning of 'almuth labben' in the superscription (v. 1)? Does it indicate a melody, liturgical instruction, or thematic clue? How have scholars interpreted this phrase?",
      "How do the perfect → imperfect → imperative verb sequences structure the psalm's theology of time? Is this a realized vs. future eschatology, or something more complex?",
      "What is the relationship between mishpat (judgment/justice) in vv. 5, 8, 17 and the psalm's theodicy? How does 'righteous judgment' function when evil persists?",
      "How does Zion theology (vv. 12, 15) function in this psalm? Is 'daughter Zion' personification, geographical location, or theological symbol? What is the relationship between God's universal throne (v. 8) and His reigning 'in Zion' (v. 12)?",
      "What is the significance of the reversal motif in v. 16 (trapped in their own devices) for Israelite wisdom theology? Are there parallels in Proverbs or other wisdom literature?",
      "How does the binary of 'nations/wicked' vs. 'afflicted/needy' function? Are these ethnic (Israel vs. nations) or moral (righteous vs. wicked) categories? Does the psalm conflate the two?",
      "What is the function of 'Higgaion Selah' in v. 17? Is this a musical notation, meditation instruction, or theological marker? Why does it appear at the reversal motif?",
      "How does the enosh (mortal humanity) wordplay in vv. 20-21 relate to Genesis 1-3 anthropology? Is this about human hubris forgetting creatureliness, paralleling the Babel narrative?",
      "What is the relationship between 'knowing God's name' (v. 11) and nations 'knowing they are mortal' (v. 21)? Are these different types of knowledge (covenant vs. recognition of limits)?"

    "micro_questions": [
      "What does the enigmatic superscription 'עַל־מוּת לַבֵּן' (almuth labben) mean, and why did even ancient translators (LXX) struggle to interpret it?",
      "Why does the psalm use 'אֱנוֹשׁ' (enosh - mortal/frail human) in vv. 20-21 rather than 'אָדָם' (adam - humanity) or 'אִישׁ' (ish - man)? Is this deliberate wordplay emphasizing creaturely mortality?",
      "What is the significance of 'הִגָּיוֹן סֶלָה' (Higgaion Selah) appearing uniquely in v. 17 at the reversal motif climax? Musical notation, meditation instruction, or theological marker?",
      "How does the psalm's acrostic structure (if intentional but incomplete) relate to its theological content about incomplete justice?",
      "Why the tension between past-tense claims of completed enemy destruction (vv. 6-7 'forever,' 'no more') and urgent present-tense petitions for God to judge enemies (vv. 20-21)?",
      "What is the relationship between 'knowing God's name' (v. 11) and nations 'knowing they are enosh' (v. 21) - are these different epistemologies (covenant intimacy vs. forced recognition)?",
      "How does 'bat-Tziyon' (daughter Zion, v. 15) function - as geographical location, personified city-as-woman, or theological symbol of covenant community?",
      "Why do both legal terms 'מִשְׁפָּט' (mishpat) and 'דִּין' (din) appear together in v. 5? Are these synonyms for emphasis or distinct aspects of justice?",
      "What does the reversal motif in v. 16 (nations trapped in own devices) suggest about divine justice - immanent moral consequences or direct divine intervention?",
      "How does Zion theology (v. 12 'dwelling in Zion') relate to universal judgment claims (v. 9 'judges world') - is Zion cosmic center or particular sanctuary?",
      "What is the significance of the LXX translating 'מוֹרָה' (morah - fear/terror) as 'νομοθέτης' (lawgiver) in v. 21? Does this reflect different understanding of divine pedagogy?",
      "Why does v. 19's 'not forever shall needy be forgotten' seem to acknowledge current divine inaction/forgetfulness, contradicting vv. 8-9's eternal throne of justice?",
      "How do the 'gates' metaphors function spatially and theologically - are sha'arei mavet (gates of death) and sha'arei bat-Tziyon (gates of daughter Zion) literal, metaphorical, or cosmological?",
      "What is the function of the causative 'כִּי' clauses throughout (vv. 5, 11, 13, 19) - do they provide genuine reasons or rhetorical justifications for petition?",
      "Why does the psalm end on petition + Selah rather than resolution or praise - is this liturgical strategy or theological statement about ongoing theodicy struggle?"
