Note: I’ll punctuate each verse to show its structure (the two-line parallelism); then explain terms as they arise.

**Verse 1**  
לַמְנַצֵּחַ; עַל־מוּת לַבֵּן; מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד׃

Superscriptions (the little titles) often note genre, tune, or occasion. Here, “עַל־מוּת לַבֵּן” (ʿal‑mut labben) is famously opaque. Rashi (11th c.) floats “on the death of [the] son,” maybe Absalom, but he finds it grammatically awkward. Others inverted “לבן” (laben) to “נבל” (Nabal), which is even harder to defend. Ibn Ezra (12th c.) and Meiri (13th c.) note that the Masoretes place a full stop after לַבֵּן, suggesting it’s a single technical phrase—most likely a tune title, like “to the melody ‘Alamoth’” (cf. Ps 46:1). That would make this line function like “To the choirmaster; to the tune ‘Death of the Son.’”

Radak (13th c.) preserves a tradition that “Labben” was a foreign ruler; Malbim (19th c.) spins a historical reading: “Laben” ruined cities and later fell into his own trap—the precise poetic justice of v.16. The Septuagint (ancient Greek) renders it “concerning the hidden things of the son” (ὑπὲρ τῶν κρυφίων τοῦ υἱοῦ), which shows they didn’t know either and made a best guess.

Bottom line for you: this is probably a musical direction. Theologically, it primes you for themes of death/memory right before a psalm that obsesses over “name” erased or remembered.

**Verse 2**  
אוֹדֶ֣ה יְהוָה בְּכָל־לִבִּי; אֲסַפְּרָ֗ה כׇּל־נִפְלְאוֹתֶֽיךָ׃

Two pledges with “all”: “with all my heart” and “all Your wonders.” אוֹדֶה (odeh) comes from ידה, which can mean both “thank” and “acknowledge/confess”—perfect for a psalm that blurs gratitude and testimony. “I will recount” (אֲסַפְּרָה) uses the verb for telling a story out loud; it’s the verb used in Exodus for parents telling children how God acted (Exod 10:2).

Notice the movement from inward to outward: whole‑heart devotion → public narration. That’s a recurring rhythm in the psalms: real praise flows into witness. Also, “wonders” (נִפְלָאוֹת) refers to God’s saving interventions (Exod 3:20; Ps 78:11): this isn’t vague gratitude; it’s memory of concrete rescues.

—

**Verse 3**  
אֶשְׂמְחָה וְאֶעֶלְצָה בָּךְ; אֲזַמְּרָה שִׁמְךָ עֶלְיוֹן׃

Three verbs of joy/action: “I will rejoice,” “I will exult,” “I will sing.” The second, אֶעֶלְצָה, suggests elated exultation. The joy is “בָּךְ” (“in You”), not just about circumstances. Then the singer “sings [God’s] name,” and God is called עֶלְיוֹן (Elyon), “Most High,” a cosmic title that complements the covenant name “YHWH” in v.2. This mix—intimate Name and universal Sovereign—prepares you for the psalm’s unusual balance: God “dwells in Zion” but judges “the world.”

—

**Verse 4**  
בְּשׁוּב־אוֹיְבַי אָחוֹר; יִכָּשְׁלוּ וְיֹאבְדוּ מִפָּנֶיךָ׃

When enemies turn back, they stumble and perish “from Your face” (מִפָּנֶיךָ). In Hebrew, “face” (פָּנִים) often means presence/action. To be “before God’s face” is to be in God’s active jurisdiction; “from Your face” here means “because You confronted them.” The verbs are in perfect form (completed action)—either narrating a past victory or stating a “done deal” from the poet’s perspective (sometimes called a “prophetic perfect”). Either way, the cause is theological, not military: it is God’s presence that undoes them.

—

**Verse 5**  
כִּֽי־עָשִׂיתָ מִשְׁפָּטִי וְדִינִי; יָשַׁבְתָּ לְכִסֵּא שׁוֹפֵט צֶדֶק׃

“Because You did my ‘mishpat’ and ‘din’.” Those are legal near‑synonyms—think “my right and my case”—a classic hendiadys (one idea expressed by two terms). The picture is a court: “You sat on the throne, a judge of righteousness.” “Righteousness” (צֶדֶק) is not a mood; it’s a standard. The “sitting” emphasizes stable rule (cf. Ps 97:2 “צֶדֶק וּמִשְׁפָּט מְכוֹן כִּסְאוֹ”—“Righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne”). What looked like a battlefield win (v.4) is reframed as a courtroom verdict.

—

**Verse 6**  
גָּעַרְתָּ גוֹיִם; אִבַּדְתָּ רָשָׁע; שְׁמָם מָחִיתָ לְעוֹלָם וָעֶד׃

Three punches: rebuked nations, destroyed the wicked, blotted out their name. Radak notes that “rebuke” (גָּעַר) without the preposition often means destructive rebuke (Mal 2:3). “Blot out the name” is the erasing‑ink image again; compare Exod 17:14 and Deut 25:19 about Amalek. The final phrase “forever and ever” stretches the timeline: this is not “until next news cycle.” The psalm loves absolutes (“forever,” “never”), which raise the stakes for the coming plea: if God is like this, then do it now.

—

**Verse 7**  
הָאוֹיֵב—תַּמּוּ חֳרָבוֹת לָנֶצַח; וְעָרִים נָתַשְׁתָּ; אָבַד זִכְרָם הֵמָּה׃

The syntax is famously jagged. “הָאוֹיֵב” can be a vocative—“O enemy!”—and what follows is broken: “finished are ruins forever.” Is “ruins” the enemy’s desolations or the cities he wrecked? Medievals split: some take “ruins” as the enemy’s work now ended; others as the cities God uprooted (נָתַשׁ, a violent verb used for ripping up plants). The last clause—“their memorial has perished, they themselves”—doubles the pronoun for emphasis (הֵמָּה). The brokenness of the Hebrew matches the scene’s wreckage—syntax as rubble.

—

**Verse 8**  
וַיהוָה לְעוֹלָם יֵשֵׁב; כּוֹנֵן לַמִּשְׁפָּט כִּסְאוֹ׃

The opening “וְ/וַ” here functions like “but”: “But the LORD sits forever; He has fixed His throne for judgment.” Rashi brings a midrash that contrasts the “incomplete throne” in Exod 17:16 (כֵּס יָהּ) with the “complete throne” here (כִּסְאוֹ): when Israel’s enemies are dealt with, God’s Name/Throne is “whole.” Even without the midrash, the idea is clear: human enemies crumble (vv.6–7), but God’s court is permanent.

—

**Verse 9**  
וְהוּא יִשְׁפֹּט־תֵּבֵל בְּצֶדֶק; יָדִין לְאֻמִּים בְּמֵישָׁרִים׃

Universal scope: “He judges the world (תֵּבֵל, the inhabited world) in righteousness; He will govern (יָדִין) the peoples with equity (בְּמֵישָׁרִים).” “Equity” (מֵישָׁרִים) literally means “levelness”—no tilted scales. Pair this with Ps 97:2 (quoted above), which says righteousness and justice are the foundation of God’s throne. The psalmist is not asking for special treatment; he’s appealing to the nature of the cosmic court.

—

**Verse 10**  
וִיהִי יְהוָה מִשְׂגָּב לַדָּךְ; מִשְׂגָּב לְעִתּוֹת בַּצָּרָה׃

“Let the LORD be a stronghold (מִשְׂגָּב) for the crushed (דָּךְ); a stronghold in times of trouble.” דָּךְ is rare—close to “crushed/lowly” (cf. Isa 57:15). The verse doubles “stronghold” to stress habitual refuge; God is “high ground.” This line echoes in High Holiday prayers (Edot HaMizrach) where God is addressed as “מִשְׂגָּב לְעִתּוֹת בַּצָּרָה”—the refuge precisely on the day of judgment.

—

**Verse 11**  
וְיִבְטְחוּ בְךָ יוֹדְעֵי שְׁמֶךָ; כִּי לֹא־עָזַבְתָּ דֹרְשֶׁיךָ יְהוָה׃

“To trust” (בָּטַח) is steady confidence. “Those who know Your name” in Hebrew means those in covenant intimacy with God, not trivia winners. “Those who seek You” (דֹרְשֶׁיךָ) evokes liturgical life—seeking God’s face, Torah, and presence. This line appears in Uva L’Tzion and in Birkhot HaTorah’s petition that we and our children be “יוֹדְעֵי שְׁמֶךָ.” The theology: trust is a byproduct of real knowing, and the reason for trust is God’s track record of not abandoning seekers.

—

**Verse 12**  
זַמְּרוּ לַיהוָה יֹשֵׁב צִיּוֹן; הַגִּידוּ בָעַמִּים עֲלִילוֹתָיו׃

Shift to imperatives: “Sing to the LORD who dwells in Zion; declare among the peoples His deeds.” Radak notes the prophetic flavor: David may write “dwells in Zion” even before Zion’s capture, because the community already knew “the Glory” would dwell there. The double command is centripetal then centrifugal: worship flows to Zion, testimony flows to the nations. “Deeds” (עֲלִילוֹת) emphasizes concrete acts, not abstractions.

—

**Verse 13**  
כִּֽי־דֹרֵשׁ דָּמִים אוֹתָם זָכָר; לֹא־שָכַח צַעֲקַת עֲנָוִים׃

“Seeker of bloods” (דֹרֵשׁ דָּמִים) is a legal idiom: the blood‑avenger, the One who prosecutes murder (cf. Gen 9:5). Here it becomes a divine title. “He remembered them”—divine remembering in the Bible is active (“God remembered Rachel”—and she conceived; Gen 30:22). Ketiv/Qere note: the written text has עֲנִיִּים (“poor”) but the reading is עֲנָוִים (“meek”); the terms overlap (the poor are typically the humbled). This verse anchors memorial prayers for martyrs (Av HaRachamim) across centuries.

—

**Verse 14**  
חָנְּנֵנִי יְהוָה; רְאֵה עׇנְיִי מִשֹּׂנְאַי; מְרוֹמְמִי מִשַּׁעֲרֵי מָוֶת׃

Here’s the pivot from theology to petition. “Be gracious to me” (Piʿel imperative; an intensified plea), “see my affliction from my haters,” and a participle for God: “You who lift me (מְרוֹמְמִי) from the gates of death.” The “gates of death” image has cousins: “Have the gates of death been revealed to you?” (Job 38:17); “they reached the gates of death” (Ps 107:18). It’s a spatial metaphor: the threshold into death’s city. God is the one who pulls you back across that threshold.

—

**Verse 15**  
לְמַעַן אֲסַפְּרָה כׇּל־תְּהִלָּתֶיךָ; בְּשַׁעֲרֵי בַת־צִיּוֹן; אָגִילָה בִּישׁוּעָתֶךָ׃

“Lemaʿan” (so that): the purpose of rescue is testimony—“that I may recount all Your praises.” Location matters: “in the gates of daughter Zion.” The gates of death (v.14) become the gates of Zion. Qetiv note: “תְּהִלָּתֶיךָ” is spelled a bit “light” (defective) but means “Your praises (plural),” suggesting multiplicity. Joy verb: “I will exult” (אָגִילָה) in “Your salvation” (יְשׁוּעָה), a term that covers deliverance big and small.

—

**Verse 16**  
טָבְעוּ גוֹיִם בְּשַַׁחַת עָשׂוּ; בְּרֶשֶׁת־זוּ טָמָנוּ—נִלְכְּדָה רַגְלָם׃

The reversal motif in a nutshell. Two trapping images: a pit (שַׁחַת) and a net (רֶשֶׁת). Both are self-made. The grammar is vivid: “their foot is caught” (נִלְכְּדָה רַגְלָם). Compare Ps 7:16 and Prov 26:27 (quoted in the intro). Malbim nicely observes the double level: they set both the net (means) and the pit (end), and both boomerang. The psalm’s theology of justice is not only top‑down (God judges) but also built into the fabric of moral cause/effect.

—

**Verse 17**  
נ֤וֹדַע יְהוָה—מִשְׁפָּט עָשָׂה; בְּפֹעַל כַּפָּיו נוֹקֵשׁ רָשָׁע; הִגָּיוֹן סֶלָה׃

“YHWH has made Himself known; He has done justice.” Then the ambiguous line: “By the work of his hands the wicked is snared.” Whose hands? It can mean the wicked’s own hands (self‑entrapment), or God’s (divine snare). Hebrew lets both resonate. Then “Higgaion. Selah.”—a musical/meditative pause. Important correction: הִגָּיוֹן occurs elsewhere (Ps 19:15; 92:4), but only here with “Selah.” The psalm asks you to stop and ponder the moral logic that just reversed the plot.

—

**Verse 18**  
יָשׁוּבוּ רְשָׁעִים לִשְׁאוֹלָה; כׇּל־גּוֹיִם שְׁכֵחֵי אֱלֹהִים׃

“Let the wicked return to Sheol; all the nations who forget God!” “Return” (שׁוּב) evokes Gen 3:19 “to dust you shall return.” “Sheol” in the Hebrew Bible is the underworld/the grave—not necessarily fiery hell—but rabbinic midrash (Torah Temimah cites Sanhedrin 105a) reads our “לִשְׁאוֹלָה” as “to the lowest level of Gehenna,” noticing the unusual ending (lamed + final he) as emphasis. Either way, the target is “God‑forgetters” (שְׁכֵחֵי אֱלֹהִים), the mirror‑image of “those who know Your name” (v.11).

—

**Verse 19**  
כִּי לֹא לָנֶצַח יִשָּׁכַח אֶבְיוֹן; תִּקְוַת עֲנִיִּים לֹא תֹאבַד לָעַד׃

Theodicy in two honest halves: “not forever” and “not forever.” It admits the present feeling—forgetfulness—while denying its finality. Ketiv/Qere note again: “עֲנִיִּים/עֲנָוִים.” Either way, the point is pastoral. This line is the bridge from imprecation (v.18) to petition (vv.20–21). If God won’t forget forever, then God should act now. That’s how biblical prayers argue: they hold God to God’s own character.

—

**Verse 20**  
קוּמָה יְהוָה; אַל־יָעֹז אֱנוֹשׁ; יִשָּׁפְטוּ גוֹיִם עַל־פָּנֶיךָ׃

Three clauses: “Rise, O LORD” (the verb shows up all over communal laments, and in Num 10:35 when the ark sets out); “Let not enosh (frail mortals) be strong” (rare Qal of עָזַז “to be strong”); and “Let the nations be judged in Your presence” (lit. “on Your face”—i.e., under Your direct gaze). Using אֱנוֹשׁ instead of אָדָם is a deliberate downgrade—“mortals, not gods.” The prayer is for judgment directly “before God,” not by proxy.

—

**Verse 21**  
שִׁיתָה יְהוָה מוֹרָה לָהֶם; יֵדְעוּ גוֹיִם אֱנוֹשׁ הֵמָּה—סֶלָה׃

“Set fear upon them” (מוֹרָה likely variant of מוֹרָא “fear”), but the Septuagint reads “lawgiver” (νομοθέτης), as if to say, “appoint a Teacher over them.” Either way, the goal is education: “Let the nations know they are enosh.” The psalm ends unresolved—with “Selah.” That’s exactly right for a prayer that lives between “You blot out names forever” and “not forever will the poor be forgotten.” The pause is part of the theology: the verdict is sure; the timing isn’t.

—

EXTRA PATTERNS TO NOTICE (for your Hebrew radar)

- Inclusio of presence: early “מִפָּנֶיךָ” (“from Your face/presence,” v.4) and late “עַל־פָּנֶיךָ” (“in Your presence,” v.20) frame the action. Enemies perish “from” God’s face; nations must stand “before” God’s face.

- Name arc: “שִׁמְךָ עֶלְיוֹן” (v.3) → “שְׁמָם מָחִיתָ” (v.6) → “אָבַד זִכְרָם” (v.7) → “יוֹדְעֵי שְׁמֶךָ” (v.11). God’s name is praised; the wicked’s name is erased; the faithful know His name.

- Related psalm echoes: Psalm 7:7 “קוּמָה יְהוָה בְּאַפֶּךָ… מִשְׁפָּט צִוִּיתָ” and Psalm 97:2 “צֶדֶק וּמִשְׁפָּט מְכוֹן כִּסְאוֹ” both hum harmonically alongside Psalm 9’s throne/judgment lines.

That’s the music of Psalm 9: grateful memory, hard‑won hope, and a sturdy insistence that mortals aren’t gods and that God’s court is still in session.
