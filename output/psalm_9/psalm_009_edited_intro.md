Psalm 9 reads like a psalm of thanks until it doesn’t. It opens in a register of wholehearted gratitude—“I will thank YHWH with all my heart; I will recount all Your wonders” (אוֹדֶה יְהוָה בְּכָל־לִבִּי; אֲסַפְּרָה כָּל־נִפְלְאוֹתֶיךָ, v. 2)—and it recounts divine victories with a finality that sounds like the end of history: “You blotted out their name forever and ever” (שְׁמָם מָחִיתָ לְעוֹלָם וָעֶד, v. 6). Yet the psalm’s center of gravity is petition: “Be gracious to me, O YHWH; see my affliction… You who lift me from the gates of death” (חָנְּנֵנִי… רְאֵה עָנְיִי… מִשַּׁעֲרֵי מָוֶת, v. 14), and climax: “Arise, O YHWH… Let the nations know they are only mortal” (קוּמָה יְהוָה… יֵדְעוּ גוֹיִם אֱנוֹשׁ הֵמָּה, vv. 20–21). What looks like thanksgiving becomes something edgier: worship as argument.

The formal architecture underwrites that argument. Psalm 9 is the first panel of a two-part acrostic (alphabetic) composition with Psalm 10 in the Masoretic Text: initial lines follow the order of the Hebrew alphabet, though with gaps, and Psalm 10 continues the sequence. (An acrostic is a poem whose lines begin with successive letters; here, the device asserts order in the face of chaos.) The ancient Greek translation (the Septuagint) merges Psalms 9 and 10 into one, acknowledging their designed unity. The acrostic is conspicuously incomplete—fitting a psalm whose justice is asserted and yet remains painfully pending.

A key to the poem is its “name” theology. God’s foes are not merely defeated; their names are erased: “You blotted out their name” (v. 6); “their memorial has perished” (v. 7; אָבַד זִכְרָם). Against this oblivion stands “those who know Your name” (יוֹדְעֵי שְׁמֶךָ, v. 11). In the ancient world, a name is more than a label; it is identity and enduring presence. Erasing a name is the utter annihilation of person or people, their memory and posterity—think of “I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek” (מָחֹה אֶמְחֶה אֶת־זֵכֶר עֲמָלֵק, Exodus 17:14). Deuteronomy repeats the idiom: “you shall blot out the memory of Amalek” (תִּמְחֶה אֶת־זֵכֶר עֲמָלֵק, Deut 25:19). Psalm 9 leans into this polarity: the wicked are remembered no more; the faithful know the Name.

Psalm 9 also works with the logic of poetic justice. Verse 16 offers the most vivid scene: “The nations sank in the pit they made… in the net they hid, their own foot is caught” (טָבְעוּ… בְּשַׁחַת עָשׂוּ; בְּרֶשֶׁת־זוּ טָמָנוּ נִלְכְּדָה רַגְלָם). This motif is elsewhere a staple of wisdom: “He dug a pit and dug it deep, and he fell into the trap he made” (בּוֹר כָּרָה וַיַּחְפְּרֵהוּ; וַיִּפֹּל בְּשַׁחַת יִפְעָל, Psalm 7:16); “Whoever digs a pit will fall into it” (כֹּרֶה שַׁחַת בָּהּ יִפֹּל, Proverbs 26:27). The psalm gives us not only retribution but a moral physics: evil collapses into its own devices. That is why verse 17 commands a meditative pause precisely here: “הִגָּיוֹן סֶלָה — Higgaion. Selah.” “Higgaion” appears elsewhere of meditation (Psalm 19:15: “וְהֶגְיוֹן לִבִּי — the meditation of my heart”) and of instrumental interlude (Psalm 92:4). The pairing with Selah (a pause marker in psalms) invites the congregation to dwell on the lesson: judgment is not only top-down; it unfolds immanently as consequences ripen.

Zion, too, is more than place. “Sing to YHWH, who dwells in Zion; proclaim His deeds among the peoples” (זַמְּרוּ לַיהוָה יֹשֵׁב צִיּוֹן; הַגִּידוּ בָעַמִּים עֲלִילוֹתָיו, v. 12). Traditional commentators already noticed that David speaks of Zion before he conquered it; Radak explains this as prophetic speech about the appointed place where the Presence will dwell. Psalm 9’s Zion is the axis where particularity and universality meet: from Zion’s gates the psalmist longs to tell “all Your praises” (v. 15), and from that center God’s judgments reach the world (vv. 8–9).

The poetry moves through time with care. The first section narrates in the perfect (a past/completed aspect): “You rebuked nations; You destroyed the wicked” (גָּעַרְתָּ גוֹיִם; אִבַּדְתָּ רָשָׁע, v. 6). Then the grammar shifts to durative-present: “But YHWH sits forever” (וַיהוָה לְעוֹלָם יֵשֵׁב, v. 8), “He judges the world in righteousness” (וְהוּא יִשְׁפֹּט־תֵבֵל בְּצֶדֶק, v. 9). Finally, imperatives and jussives surge: “Arise!” (קוּמָה), “Let not man prevail” (אַל־יָעֹז), “Let the nations be judged” (יִשָּׁפְטוּ), “Put fear upon them” (שִׁיתָה… מוֹרָה). The rhetoric is telescopic: past deliverance authorizes present confidence; both drive a demand for God’s visible rule now.

Two short, difficult words in the final line concentrate the psalm’s theology of knowledge. “Set upon them מוֹרָה (morah), O YHWH; let the nations know they are enosh” (v. 21). “Morah” commonly means “fear/dread” (מוֹרָא), and thus most medievals read “put fear upon them.” The Greek translators, however, rendered it “lawgiver” (νομοθέτης), as if reading מוֹרֶה, “teacher.” Both belong: the point is pedagogical. God’s intervention—by awe or by instruction—aims at a single lesson: “אֱנוֹשׁ הֵמָּה — they are mortal.” “Enosh” is not the generic “adam,” but a term tilted toward frailty: “What is enosh that You are mindful of him?” (מָה־אֱנוֹשׁ, Psalm 8:5); “Who are you that you fear enosh who will die?” (מִי־אַתְּ… מֵאֱנוֹשׁ יָמוּת, Isaiah 51:12). The psalm thus ends not with Israel’s triumphalism but with anthropology: the nations must relearn creatureliness.

Psalm 9’s hardest line may be the softest sounding: “For not forever shall the needy be forgotten; the hope of the poor shall not perish forever” (כִּי לֹא לָנֶצַח יִשָּׁכַח אֶבְיוֹן; תִּקְוַת עֲנִיִּים תֹּאבַד לָעַד, v. 19). The double negative is a confession that, for now, the afflicted are “forgotten.” The biblical word “remember” (זָכַר) is not a mental verb; it means “to act.” God “remembered” Noah—and the waters subsided; God “remembered” Rachel—and she conceived. So here: the psalm dares to say that divine “remembrance” must be made manifest. That is why this psalm is a prayer, not a retrospective. It speaks of erased names and established thrones, but it will not allow divine justice to remain a theological generality. It is praise that becomes a petition.

Technical notes for the reader: “Acrostic” refers to the alphabetic structure of lines (here shared with Psalm 10). A “colon” is a single line in the parallel pair that makes up Hebrew verse. “Jussive” is a verb form that expresses a wish or command-like desire (“let X be”). “Selah” is a liturgical pause marker in the Psalms; its exact function is uncertain.

#### Key verses

וְיִבְטְחוּ בְךָ יוֹדְעֵי שְׁמֶךָ; כִּי לֹא־עָזַבְתָּ דֹרְשֶׁיךָ יְהוָה (Psalm 9:11) — “Those who know Your name trust in You; for You have not forsaken those who seek You, O YHWH.” This line anchors the daily Uva L’Tzion. It is paired with Isaiah 26:4, forming an antiphon of trust: “בִּטְחוּ בַיהוָה עֲדֵי־עַד כִּי בְּיָהּ יְהוָה צוּר עוֹלָמִים. וְיִבְטְחוּ בְךָ יוֹדְעֵי שְׁמֶךָ כִּי לֹא־עָזַבְתָּ דֹרְשֶׁיךָ יְהוָה.” In context, the congregation affirms covenantal knowledge as confidence before the concluding Kaddish.

כִּי־דֹרֵשׁ דָּמִים אוֹתָם זָכָר; לֹא־שָׁכַח צַעֲקַת עֲנָוִים (Psalm 9:13) — “For He who seeks blood remembers them; He does not forget the cry of the humble.” Ashkenazi Av HaRachamim quotes it after Psalm 79’s plea for vengeance: “יִוָּדַע בַּגּוֹיִם לְעֵינֵינוּ נִקְמַת דַּם עֲבָדֶיךָ הַשָּׁפוּךְ; וְאוֹמֵר: כִּי דֹרֵשׁ דָּמִים אוֹתָם זָכָר, לֹא שָׁכַח צַעֲקַת עֲנָוִים.” Here the verse becomes communal memory-work for Jewish martyrs.

#### Phrases

מִשְׂגָּב לְעִתּוֹת בַּצָּרָה (Psalm 9:10) — “a stronghold in times of trouble.” In the Mizrahi High Holiday piyyut “Atanu L’chalot Panecha” the community appeals: “אָתָאנוּ לְבַקֵּשׁ מִמְּךָ כַּפָּרָה. אָיֹם וְנוֹרָא, מִשְׂגָּב לְעִתּוֹת בַּצָּרָה.” The psalm’s refuge-language becomes the congregation’s scaffold on the Day of Judgment.

וַיהוָה לְעוֹלָם יֵשֵׁב; כוֹנֵן לַמִּשְׁפָּט כִּסְאוֹ (Psalm 9:8) — Used in Edot HaMizrach within the “Ten Remembrances,” echoing the petition to erase Amalek: “…וְתִמְחֶה אֶת זֵכֶר עֲמָלֵק… וַיהוָה לְעוֹלָם יֵשֵׁב כוֹנֵן לַמִּשְׁפָּט כִּסְאוֹ.” The verse grounds the plea in God’s eternal judicial throne.

These liturgical adoptions are not accidental; they show how the tradition reads the psalm: trust as knowledge of the Name, refuge in judgment’s hour, and a God who remembers blood and enthrones justice.
