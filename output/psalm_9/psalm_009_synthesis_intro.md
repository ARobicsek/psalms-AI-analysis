# Introduction Essay: Psalm 9

The rabbis who compiled the *siddur* understood something that modern readers often miss: Psalm 9 is not really a thanksgiving psalm. Yes, it opens with David's vow to "give thanks to the LORD with all my heart" (אוֹדֶ֣ה יְ֭הֹוָה בְּכׇל־לִבִּ֑י, v. 2), and yes, verses 4–7 recount past victories in language so absolute it sounds like eschatological finality: "You have blotted out their name forever and ever" (שְׁמָ֥ם מָ֝חִ֗יתָ לְעוֹלָ֥ם וָעֶֽד, v. 6). But the psalm's center of gravity lies elsewhere—in the urgent imperatives of verses 14 and 20–21, where the psalmist pleads for God to "arise" (קוּמָ֣ה) and judge the nations "in Your presence" (עַל־פָּנֶֽיךָ). The poem's architectural brilliance lies in how it transforms recollection into petition, memory into demand. Past deliverance becomes the warrant for immediate divine intervention, and thanksgiving becomes the rhetorical vehicle for lament.

This interpretive tension is embedded in the psalm's very structure, which scholars have long noted forms an incomplete acrostic with Psalm 10 (treated as a single unit in the Septuagint). The alphabetic scaffold runs from *aleph* through *kaph* but with conspicuous gaps, as if the poet were signaling incompleteness at the formal level. One might read this structural rupture as accidental, a product of textual corruption, but it aligns too perfectly with the psalm's theological argument: divine justice, though affirmed in cosmic terms—"But the LORD is enthroned forever; He has established His throne for judgment" (וַֽ֭יהֹוָה לְעוֹלָ֣ם יֵשֵׁ֑ב כּוֹנֵ֖ן לַמִּשְׁפָּ֣ט כִּסְאֽוֹ, v. 8)—remains disturbingly incomplete in lived experience. The acrostic fragments because the work of justice fragments.

The psalm's opening testimony (vv. 2–7) uses perfect-tense verbs to narrate what God has already accomplished: "You rebuked the nations, You destroyed the wicked" (גָּעַ֣רְתָּ ג֭וֹיִם אִבַּ֣דְתָּ רָשָׁ֑ע, v. 6). But whose enemies are these? The enigmatic superscription "עַל־מוּת לַבֵּן" (*'al-mut labben*) has puzzled interpreters since antiquity. Rashi suggests it refers to the death of Absalom, while Radak and Ibn Ezra propose a foreign oppressor named "Labben." The medieval commentator Meiri reads it as a musical notation of uncertain meaning. What matters is that the psalm frames its thanksgiving as retrospective: it looks back to a particular moment of vindication. Yet this very specificity creates the problem the psalm must address. If God has already "blotted out their name forever" (v. 6), why must the psalmist still cry, "Have mercy on me, O LORD; see my affliction at the hands of my foes" (חָֽנְנֵ֬נִי יְהֹוָ֗ה רְאֵ֣ה עׇ֭נְיִי מִשֹּׂנְאָ֑י, v. 14)? The sudden shift from praise to petition at verse 14 is not a structural flaw but the psalm's central theological move.

This is where the psalm's "name theology" becomes crucial. Throughout the text, *shem* (שֵׁם, "name") functions as the axis between memory and oblivion, covenant and annihilation. God's enemies are undone not merely by military defeat but by the erasure of their *shem*: "You have blotted out their name" (שְׁמָ֥ם מָ֝חִ֗יתָ, v. 6), "their very memorial has perished" (אָבַ֖ד זִכְרָ֣ם הֵֽמָּה, v. 7). Meanwhile, those who trust in God are defined precisely by their relationship to the divine *shem*: "Those who know Your name will trust in You" (וְיִבְטְח֣וּ בְ֭ךָ יוֹדְעֵ֣י שְׁמֶ֑ךָ, v. 11). This covenantal intimacy appears liturgically in the daily *Birkhot HaTorah*, where the phrase "יוֹדְעֵ֣י שְׁמֶ֑ךָ" is woven into a forward-looking petition: "וְנִהְיֶה אֲנַֽחְנוּ וְצֶאֱצָאֵֽינוּ... כֻּלָּֽנוּ יוֹדְעֵי שְׁמֶֽךָ וְלוֹמְדֵי תוֹרָתֶֽךָ לִשְׁמָהּ" ("and may we and our descendants... all be knowers of Your Name and learners of Your Torah for its own sake"). The liturgy recognizes that "knowing God's name" is not static possession but ongoing relationship, mediated through Torah study and sustained across generations.

Yet the psalm refuses to rest in abstractions about divine knowledge. Verses 16–17 locate the hinge between testimony and theodicy in a vivid image of poetic justice: "The nations have sunk in the pit they made; in the net they hid, their own foot is caught" (טָבְע֣וּ ג֭וֹיִם בְּשַׁ֣חַת עָשׂ֑וּ בְּרֶֽשֶׁת־ז֥וּ טָ֝מָ֗נוּ נִלְכְּדָ֥ה רַגְלָֽם, v. 16). This is measure-for-measure justice, familiar from wisdom literature (cf. Proverbs 26:27, "Whoever digs a pit will fall into it"). But here it carries a liturgical marker rarely seen elsewhere: "Higgaion Selah" (הִגָּי֥וֹן סֶֽלָה). The term *higgaion*, appearing only here in the Psalter, likely signals a meditative pause or instrumental interlude (from *hagah*, "to muse"). Its placement is deliberate: the reader is commanded to pause and contemplate the doctrine of immanent retribution—that evil defeats itself, that "the wicked man is snared by the work of his own hands" (בְּפֹ֣עַל כַּ֭פָּיו נוֹקֵ֣שׁ רָשָׁ֑ע, v. 17). The psalm wants us to *dwell* on this theological claim before it reveals its true desperation.

For immediately after this meditative pause comes the psalm's sharpest temporal correction: "For not forever shall the needy be forgotten; the hope of the afflicted shall not perish forever" (כִּ֤י לֹ֣א לָ֭נֶצַח יִשָּׁכַ֣ח אֶבְי֑וֹן תִּקְוַ֥ת עֲ֝נִיִּ֗ים תֹּאבַ֥ד לָעַֽד, v. 19). The double negative construction is rhetorically pointed: it acknowledges that the *evyon* (אֶבְי֑וֹן, "needy") and *'aniyim* (עֲ֝נִיִּ֗ים, "afflicted") *are* currently forgotten, that their hope *is* in danger of perishing. The verse does not declare, "God always remembers the poor"; it insists, "God will *not* forget them *forever*." This is not triumphalism but theodicy—an argument with God disguised as praise.

The psalm's climactic petitions (vv. 20–21) make this explicit through a striking anthropological turn. Twice the psalmist uses the term *enosh* (אֱנ֑וֹשׁ), emphasizing human frailty: "Rise, O LORD! Let not *enosh* have power" (קוּמָ֣ה יְ֭הֹוָה אַל־יָעֹ֣ז אֱנ֑וֹשׁ, v. 20); "Let the nations know they are *enosh*" (יֵדְע֥וּ גוֹיִ֑ם אֱנ֖וֹשׁ הֵ֣מָּה, v. 21). Unlike *adam* (humanity in general) or *ish* (man as individual), *enosh* carries connotations of mortality and weakness (cf. Job 4:17, Isaiah 51:12). The choice is deliberate: the nations must learn their creatureliness, their radical dependence. This pedagogical demand—"שִׁ֘יתָ֤ה יְהֹוָ֨ה ׀ מוֹרָ֗ה לָ֫הֶ֥ם" ("Put fear upon them, O LORD," v. 21)—frames divine intervention not as arbitrary punishment but as necessary instruction in reality. The Septuagint's rendering of *morah* (מוֹרָ֗ה, "fear") as *nomothetes* ("lawgiver") suggests that ancient translators understood this as establishing cosmic order, teaching the nations their place within it.

This brings us to the psalm's Zion theology, which functions less as geographical reference than as theological claim. When the psalmist calls to "sing to the LORD, who dwells in Zion" (זַמְּר֗וּ לַ֭יהֹוָה יֹשֵׁ֣ב צִיּ֑וֹן, v. 12) and speaks of being brought "to the gates of daughter Zion" (בְּשַׁעֲרֵ֥י בַת־צִיּ֑וֹן, v. 15), we encounter a spatial theology that moves from "gates of death" (מִשַּׁ֥עֲרֵי מָֽוֶת, v. 14) to gates of life. Radak notes that though David wrote this when Zion was still "in the hands of the Jebusites," the psalm speaks prophetically of where "the Glory shall dwell." This tension between historical fact and eschatological hope mirrors the psalm's larger structure: it simultaneously affirms God's eternal throne (v. 8) and demands God's immediate action (v. 20). The liturgical tradition understood this duality profoundly. In the Ashkenazic *Av HaRachamim*, verse 13 ("For He who exacts retribution for bloodshed remembers them; He does not forget the cry of the humble") appears in a catena of verses invoking divine justice for martyrs, transforming the psalm's particular plea into a communal memory-work spanning centuries of Jewish suffering.

Psalm 9 earns its canonical place not by resolving the tension between divine promise and present reality but by refusing to let that tension remain abstract. It constructs a sophisticated theological argument: *because* God has established His throne for justice (v. 8), *because* past deliverance has occurred (vv. 4–7), *therefore* the current scandal of injustice—nations forgetting God (v. 18), the afflicted crying out (v. 13), *enosh* exercising power (v. 20)—is theologically intolerable. The psalm demands action by appealing to God's own character and past deeds. In this sense, it is less a song of thanksgiving than a liturgical argument, worship that refuses to acquiesce to an incomplete justice, praise that becomes petition, memory that transforms into demand. The incomplete acrostic structure may indeed symbolize the incompleteness of divine justice in the present age—but the psalm's very existence insists that this incompleteness cannot be the final word.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

Psalm 9 does not appear as a liturgical unit in contemporary Jewish prayer, unlike psalms designated for specific days or occasions. However, individual verses from this psalm have been incorporated strategically into the liturgy, revealing how the tradition has interpreted its theological claims.

The verse "וְיִבְטְח֣וּ בְ֭ךָ יוֹדְעֵ֣י שְׁמֶ֑ךָ כִּ֤י לֹֽא־עָזַ֖בְתָּ דֹרְשֶׁ֣יךָ יְהֹוָֽה" ("And those who know Your name will trust in You, for You have not forsaken those who seek You, O LORD," v. 11) appears in the *Uva L'Tzion* (Seder Kedusha) across all major rites. This collection of verses follows the Shacharit service daily and introduces the Amidah on Rosh Hashanah and at Neilah on Yom Kippur. In this context, the verse is paired with Isaiah 26:4, "בִּטְחוּ בַיהוָֹה עֲדֵי עַד כִּי בְּיָהּ יְהֹוָה צוּר עוֹלָמִים" ("Trust in the LORD forever, for in Yah the LORD is an everlasting rock"), creating a catena affirming divine faithfulness. The liturgical placement transforms the verse from David's personal testimony into a communal affirmation of trust, recited precisely at moments when the congregation prepares for judgment (Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur) or concludes study (daily Shacharit). The tradition reads "those who know Your name" covenantally—not as cognitive knowledge but as intimate relationship sustained through prayer and study.

Verse 13, "כִּֽי־דֹרֵ֣שׁ דָּ֭מִים אוֹתָ֣ם זָכָ֑ר" ("For He who exacts retribution for bloodshed remembers them"), appears in the Ashkenazic *Av HaRachamim* memorial prayer, recited after the Torah reading on Shabbat. The liturgical text quotes: "יִוָּדַע בַּגּוֹיִם לְעֵינֵינוּ נִקְמַת דַּם עֲבָדֶיךָ הַשָּׁפוּךְ: וְאוֹמֵר, כִּי דוֹרֵשׁ דָּמִים אוֹתָם זָכָר לֹא שָׁכַח צַעֲקַת עֲנָוִים" ("Let the vengeance for Your servants' spilled blood be known among the nations in our sight. And it says: For He who exacts retribution for bloodshed remembers them; He does not forget the cry of the humble"). This usage, emerging after the First Crusade massacres, appropriates David's plea for vindication and applies it to Jewish martyrdom across history, transforming the psalm's "blood" (*damim*) from individual injury to collective trauma.
