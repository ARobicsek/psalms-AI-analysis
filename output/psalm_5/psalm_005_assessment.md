# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 5

What works: The draft captures Psalm 5’s logic with admirable clarity: the morning petition (vv. 2–4), the uncompromising holiness of God (vv. 5–7), a hinge of grace (v. 8), and, by the end, an encompassing favor “like a shield” (v. 13). The treatment of speech—silent meditation versus corrupt tongues—is especially incisive, and the note that v. 8’s “But I” (וַאֲנִי) is a theological pivot is exactly right. The inclusion of Malbim’s “arranging” as cultic preparation is helpful, and the comment on the temple-entrance echoes of גור (to sojourn) is on target. The draft also respects traditional voices without drowning in apparatus; it mostly reads like a seasoned scholar guiding a thoughtful reader.

What needs work: The essay too often asserts comparisons and liturgical usage without showing them. For intelligent lay readers, seeing the Hebrew (with translation) is part of the payoff. When you say Psalm 5:8 sits at the heart of Ma Tovu, quote it, in Hebrew and English. When you invoke parallels (e.g., Ps 15:1; Ps 55:22; Jer 5:16), quote them. Several technical terms (anaphora, jussive, entrance liturgy) appear without brief definitions. The figurative “open grave” (קֶבֶר־פָּתוּחַ) has obvious parallels (Jer 5:16; Ps 55:22; Ps 12:3) that should be shown. Torah Temimah’s note (Berakhot 6b) that “four groups do not receive the Divine Presence” should be integrated where speech-sins culminate. The LXX superscription’s oddity deserves a line. Finally, the liturgical section needs structure (subheadings) and quoted prayers; otherwise it reads like a catalogue.

Answerable questions to address: 1) הֲגִיגִי appears again in Ps 39:4; quote and connect the interiority. 2) עָרַךְ (“arrange”) in Lev 1:7–8; show how prayer is framed as an offering. 3) גור and Ps 15:1 (“Who may sojourn in Your tent?”) should be quoted to underscore the motif. 4) The “open grave” image: quote Jer 5:16 and the “smooth” tongue in Ps 55:22 and Ps 12:3. 5) Note the deliberate echo between בְּרֹב חַסְדְּךָ (v. 8) and בְּרֹב פִּשְׁעֵיהֶם (v. 11). 6) Define key terms (anaphora; colon). In short: keep the fine architecture, but show the stones—quote the Hebrew, define the terms, and let the reader hear the psalm’s music by seeing its words.
