Psalm 5 is a morning prayer that begins in the half-light. Before words come, there is the inaudible press of thought: “אֲמָרַי הַאֲזִינָה יְהוָה; בִּינָה הֲגִיגִי” — “Give ear to my words, O LORD; understand my meditation” (v. 2). The noun הֲגִיגִי, from הגה, names a murmur or musing—what the mouth has not yet formed but the heart already feels. Its companion verse in the Psalter makes the point explicit: “דִּבַּרְתִּי בִלְשׁוֹנִי; הוֹדִיעֵנִי יְהוָה קִצִּי… חָמַם לִבִּי בְּקִרְבִּי; בַּהֲגִיגִי תִּבְעַר אֵשׁ” — “I spoke with my tongue: ‘LORD, make me know my end’… My heart grew hot within me; while I was musing, fire burned” (Ps 39:4–5). Psalm 5’s opening insists that prayer includes what the self does not yet articulate; God must “consider” it.

The poem is patiently built. Verses 2–4 ask to be heard—“Give ear… Hearken… In the morning You hear my voice”—and then sketch the ritual posture: “בֹּקֶר אֶעֱרׇךְ־לְךָ; וַאֲצַפֶּה” — “At daybreak I will arrange [my prayer] before You; and I will keep watch” (v. 4). The verb עָרַךְ (to arrange) is cultic: the priests “arrange” the wood and offering upon the altar (Lev 1:7–8: “וְעָרַךְ הַכֹּהֵן עֵצִים… וְעָרַךְ הַנֶּתַחִים”). Here, the petitioner orders his prayer as a sacrificial setting-out at dawn, then waits like a sentry. The double “morning” (בֹּקֶר… בֹּקֶר), an instance of anaphora (purposeful repetition at the start of clauses), fixes the hour and instills cadence. Read aloud with the Masoretic accent, the repetition falls with palpable emphasis: “בֹּ֥קֶר תִּשְׁמַ֣ע… בֹּ֥קֶר אֶעֱרׇךְ־לְךָ” — the morning is not a clock-time but a liturgical gate.

Then comes theology in a series of exclusions. “For You are not a God who desires wickedness; evil does not sojourn with You” (v. 5). The verb גור (“to sojourn”) is the verb of the resident alien and, in the Psalms, of temple access: “יְהוָה, מִי־יָגוּר בְּאָהֳלֶךָ? מִי־יִשְׁכֹּן בְּהַר קׇדְשֶׁךָ?” — “LORD, who may sojourn in Your tent? Who may dwell on Your holy mountain?” (Ps 15:1). Psalm 5 presses the point: God’s presence is uninhabitable to evil. The next line extends the image from dwelling to courtly standing: “לֹא־יִתְיַצְּבוּ הוֹלְלִים לְנֶגֶד עֵינֶיךָ; שָׂנֵאתָ כׇּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן” — “The boastful cannot take their stand before Your eyes; You hate all evildoers” (v. 6). To “stand before” is the posture of servants admitted to a king. The poem is not coy about God’s affect: hatred and abhorrence fall upon “speakers of lies,” upon “the man of blood and deceit” (v. 7). Rabbinic tradition crystallized this ethical emphasis: “Four classes do not receive the Divine Presence—scoffers, flatterers, liars, and slanderers” (Berakhot 6b), a catalogue that maps closely onto Psalm 5’s speech sins.

If the psalm ended here, worship would collapse into moralism. It does not. Instead, a hinge opens with a single turn of phrase: “וַאֲנִי בְּרֹב חַסְדְּךָ אָבוֹא בֵיתֶךָ” — “But I, through the abundance of Your steadfast love, shall enter Your house” (v. 8). The preposition בְּ (“by means of”) makes the claim stark: access is by grace, not self-congratulation. The line answers the entrance question of Psalm 15 with a different register. There, the entry conditions are ethical: “He who walks blamelessly and does justice…” (Ps 15:2). Here, the poet’s entry is “through the abundance of Your ḥesed,” God’s covenant loyalty. That is not a contradiction; it is a dialectic. The house that excludes wickedness opens to the petitioner not as a reward for blamelessness but as a gift—received “בְּיִרְאָתֶךָ,” “in awe,” for grace does not cancel reverence.

The psalm’s anatomy of evil is linguistic. Enemies are defined not first as violent but as duplicitous: “There is no steadfastness in their mouth… their throat is an open grave; they make their tongue smooth” (v. 10). The image is precise and disturbing. Jeremiah speaks the figure in another key: “אַשְׁפָּתוֹ כְּקֶבֶר פָּתוּחַ” — “His quiver is like an open grave” (Jer 5:16), an image of deadly intent. The Psalter knows the smooth tongue well: “חָלְקוּ מַחְמָאוֹת פִּיו… רַכּוּ דְבָרָיו מִשֶּׁמֶן” — “Smoother than butter were his words… his words were softer than oil” (Ps 55:22); “שְׂפַת חֲלָקוֹת” — “a slippery/smooth lip” (Ps 12:3). In Psalm 5 the metaphor becomes anatomical: from mouth (פֶּה) to inner parts (קֶרֶב) to throat (גָּרוֹן) to tongue (לָשׁוֹן). It is not just what they say; something in the organ of speech itself has become a devouring opening.

After the hinge of grace (v. 8) and the anatomy of duplicity (v. 10), the psalm turns to prayer for guidance: “יְהוָה, נְחֵנִי בְצִדְקָתֶךָ… הַיְשַׁר לְפָנַי דַּרְכֶּךָ” — “O LORD, lead me in Your righteousness… make Your way straight before me” (v. 9). The verb נחה (to lead) evokes shepherding; the request is moral and practical. Two verses later, the psalm returns to abundance, this time on the other side: “בְּרֹב פִּשְׁעֵיהֶם הַדִּיחֵמוֹ” — “for the abundance of their transgressions, thrust them out” (v. 11). Read with v. 8 (“through the abundance of Your ḥesed”), the pair sketches an ethical antiphony: abundant grace grants access; abundant transgression compels expulsion. The balance is not exact (grace is not earned), but the parallelism is deliberate and memorable.

The poem ends where it began—in the grammar of refuge—but with the mood transposed to joy: “וְיִשְׂמְחוּ כָּל־חוֹסֵי בָךְ… וְיַעְלְצוּ בְךָ אֹהֲבֵי שְׁמֶךָ” — “Let all who take refuge in You rejoice… let those who love Your name exult in You” (v. 12). To “take refuge” (חסה) is a stock verb for trust in the Psalms (e.g., Ps 36:8: “בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ יֶחֱסָיוּן” — “In the shadow of Your wings they take refuge”); it describes orientation, not moral bookkeeping. The final metaphor is martial and tender at once: “כַּצִּנָּה רָצוֹן תַּעְטְרֶנּוּ” — “With favor, like a large shield, You encompass him” (v. 13). צִנָּה is the full-body shield; עָטַר can mean both “to crown” and “to encircle.” God’s favor is both honor and surrounding defense. The Greek translators leaned into the honorific (“you will crown”), but the Hebrew holds both senses. Either way, the righteous here are finally not those who brag about their record; they are “those who take refuge,” “those who love Your name,” and, by the last line, “צַדִּיק,” a term now filled by trust and orientation as much as by deed.

Even the superscription is a small puzzle and a reminder of lost performance practice: “לַמְנַצֵּחַ אֶל־הַנְּחִילוֹת” — “For the choirmaster; on the neḥiloth” (v. 1). The LXX takes a wild swing (“concerning the one who inherits”), perhaps connecting it to נַחֲלָה (inheritance). Medievals split: Rav Hai Gaon and Radak linked נְחִילוֹת to a “swarm” (נְחִיל) of bees; Rashi and Ibn Ezra took it as a musical label. Modern lexica cautiously suggest flutes (חָלִיל) or a melody. The truth is, we no longer know. What we do know is what the rest of the line makes plain: this is song for the sanctuary—ordered, sung, and entrusted to a leader.

The paradox that holds the poem together is not a system but a posture: God’s presence is morally incandescent (“evil cannot sojourn”), and yet the petitioner’s entry is by grace alone (“through the abundance of Your ḥesed”). The worshiper “arranges” prayer as an offering at dawn and stands waiting. He asks to be led on a straight road while enemies sharpen their tongues. He flees into God’s shelter and finds the covering, in the end, is favor itself.

וַאֲנִי בְּרֹב חַסְדְּךָ אָבוֹא בֵיתֶךָ; אֶשְׁתַּחֲוֶה אֶל־הֵיכַל־קׇדְשְׁךָ בְּיִרְאָתֶךָ (Ps 5:8). “But I, through the abundance of Your mercy, shall enter Your house; I shall bow toward Your holy temple in awe of You.” This verse anchors Ma Tovu, recited when entering synagogue. The prayer quotes the verse verbatim: “וַאֲנִי בְּרֹב חַסְדְּךָ אָבוֹא בֵיתֶךָ; אֶשְׁתַּחֲוֶה אֶל הֵיכַל קָדְשְׁךָ בְּיִרְאָתֶךָ.” English: “As for me, through Your abundant mercy I enter Your house; I bow toward Your holy temple in awe.” The liturgy thus makes the psalm’s theology of access an entrance rite for daily prayer.

הַקְשִׁיבָה לְקוֹל שַׁוְעִי, מַלְכִּי וֵאלֹהָי; כִּי־אֵלֶיךָ אֶתְפַּלָּל (Ps 5:3). “Hearken to the voice of my cry, my King and my God; for to You I pray.” In Eastern rites (Edot HaMizrach), this appears in the Mincha preparatory block before the Amidah, immediately after Ps 141:2: “תִּכּוֹן תְּפִלָּתִי קְטֹרֶת לְפָנֶיךָ… הַקְשִׁיבָה לְקוֹל שַׁוְעִי מַלְכִּי וֵאלֹהָי כִּי־אֵלֶיךָ אֶתְפַּלָּל.” English: “May my prayer be set before You as incense… Give heed to the voice of my cry, my King and my God, for to You I pray.” It functions as the threshold invocation to the central prayer.

יְהוָה, בֹּקֶר תִּשְׁמַע קוֹלִי; בֹּקֶר אֶעֱרָךְ־לְךָ, וַאֲצַפֶּה (Ps 5:4). “LORD, at daybreak You hear my voice; at daybreak I arrange [my prayer] for You and watch.” In Sefard usage, this line is the people’s response within Birkat Kohanim: “יְהוָה בֹּקֶר תִּשְׁמַע קוֹלִי; בֹּקֶר אֶעֱרָךְ־לְךָ וַאֲצַפֶּה.” English: “LORD, in the morning hear my voice; in the morning I set it before You and wait.” The community answers the priestly blessing by renewing the dawn vigil.

יְהוָה, נְחֵנִי בְצִדְקָתֶךָ לְמַעַן שׁוֹרְרָי; הַיְשַׁר לְפָנַי דַּרְכֶּךָ (Ps 5:9). “O LORD, lead me in Your righteousness because of my watchers; make Your way straight before me.” Commonly recited when leaving synagogue in Sefard nusach: “כְּשֶׁיוֹצֵא מִבֵּית הַכְּנֶסֶת אוֹמֵר: יְהוָה נְחֵנִי בְצִדְקָתֶךָ… הַיְשַׁר לְפָנַי דַּרְכֶּךָ.” English: “Lead me in Your righteousness… make Your way straight before me.” The verse becomes a benediction for re-entering ordinary life.

#### Phrases

אֲמָרַי הַאֲזִינָה יְהוָה; בִּינָה הֲגִיגִי (Ps 5:2). “Give ear to my words, O LORD; understand my meditation.” Selichot often weave it into confessional entreaties: “אֲמָרֵינוּ הַאֲזִינָה יְהוָה; בִּינָה הֲגִיגֵנוּ… יִהְיוּ לְרָצוֹן אִמְרֵי פִינוּ וְהֶגְיוֹן לִבֵּנוּ” — “Give ear to our words, O LORD; consider our meditation… Let the words of our mouth and the meditation of our heart be acceptable.”

הַקְשִׁיבָה לְקוֹל (Ps 5:3). “Give heed to the voice…” Appears repeatedly in penitential poetry, e.g., High Holiday Selichot: “הַקְשִׁיבָה לְקוֹל תַּחֲנוּנֵינוּ; הַקְשִׁיבָה לְקוֹל שַׁוְעָתֵנוּ, מַלְכֵּנוּ וֵאלֹהֵינוּ.” English: “Give heed to the voice of our supplications; give heed to the voice of our cry, our King and our God.”

The liturgy consistently reads the psalm “with the grain”: morning as the hour of ordered prayer; entry into God’s house as a mercy; and the straight path as a gift asked for and received.
