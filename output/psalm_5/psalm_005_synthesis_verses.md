**Verse 1**

לַמְנַצֵּ֬חַ ׀ אֶֽל־הַנְּחִיל֥וֹת מִזְמ֗וֹר לְדָוִֽד׃

For the leader; upon the nehiloth. A psalm of David.

The superscription presents an exegetical puzzle that has vexed interpreters from antiquity to the present: what are the *nehiloth* (נְחִילוֹת)? The word is a hapax legomenon in biblical Hebrew, appearing nowhere else in Scripture, and ancient versions struggled with it. The LXX renders it ὑπὲρ τῆς κληρονομούσης ("concerning the one inheriting"), suggesting the translators tentatively connected it to נַחֲלָה (inheritance), though this interpretation makes little theological sense in the context of the psalm's contents, which concern divine justice and protection, not inheritance themes. Medieval Jewish commentators offered more grounded proposals. Ibn Ezra, characteristically rationalist, suggests *nehiloth* refers to תְּחִלַּת פִּיּוּט ("the beginning of a piyyut," i.e., a melody or tune), effectively treating it as a musical notation. Rashi and Radak, following Rav Hai Gaon, derive the term from נְחִיל דְּבוֹרִים ("a swarm of bees," cf. Mishnah Baba Kamma 10:2), arguing that the psalm's music was meant to resemble קוֹל צְרִיחַת הַדְּבוֹרִים ("the sound of buzzing bees"). This interpretation finds the music mimetic, evoking the droning hum of a bee colony—an intriguing attempt to recover ancient performance practice through etymology. Modern philologists remain uncertain, though Klein's Dictionary cautiously suggests a relation to either חָלִיל (flute) or the aforementioned bee-swarm, acknowledging the term's fundamental obscurity.

What the superscription *does* establish clearly is liturgical intentionality. The phrase לַמְנַצֵּחַ ("for the leader/conductor") appears in fifty-five psalm superscriptions, designating this as a composition for formal, public worship under professional musical direction, not private devotion. The designation מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִֽד ("psalm of David") situates it within the Davidic collection, whether this signals authorship, dedication, or simply canonical association with Israel's archetypal poet-king. The superscription thus frames what follows as liturgically authorized speech, prepared and performed within the structures of communal worship, though the precise musical conventions it encoded remain tantalizingly beyond our recovery.

**Verse 2**

אֲמָרַ֖י הַאֲזִ֥ינָה ׀ יְהֹוָ֗ה; בִּ֣ינָה הֲגִיגִֽי׃

Give ear to my words, O LORD; consider my meditation.

The opening petition deploys a doubled, synonymously parallel structure that escalates from exterior speech to interior contemplation. The first colon presents אֲמָרַי ("my words/utterances")—the externalized, articulated dimension of prayer—paired with the imperative הַאֲזִינָה ("give ear"), which employs the root א-ז-ן, etymologically related to אֹזֶן (ear). This verb creates a vivid anthropomorphism: God is petitioned to "incline His ear," as if bending down to hear a whisper. The second colon shifts register with בִּינָה הֲגִיגִי ("consider my meditation"), where הֲגִיגִי, derived from the root ה-ג-ה (to murmur, meditate), designates something fundamentally *pre-verbal*: the interior stirring of thought, the nascent groan or contemplation that has not yet crystallized into speech. BDB notes that הָגִיג appears only here and in Psalm 39:4, consistently denoting an inner "murmuring" or "musing" distinct from articulated words. Radak astutely captures the progression: מַה שֶׁאוֹצִיא בְּפִי הַאֲזִינָה, וּמַה שֶׁאֶהְגֶּה בְּלִבִּי בִּינָה ("What I utter with my mouth—give ear; what I meditate in my heart—consider").

This linguistic structure embodies a theology of prayer as comprehensive disclosure. The psalmist seeks divine attention not merely for his articulated petitions (אֲמָרַי) but for the unarticulated depths (הֲגִיגִי)—the sighs, anxieties, and half-formed yearnings that exceed language. The verb בִּינָה ("consider, understand") in the second colon is an imperative form demanding God's active interpretive engagement: the meditation *requires* divine discernment to be understood. The progression from "hear" to "understand" suggests that what is whispered in the heart demands more than mere audition—it requires God's hermeneutical penetration. This opening thus establishes prayer as an act where human language reaches its limit and divine understanding must bridge the gap, a theme that will recur in the psalm's tension between human supplication and divine sovereignty. Ibn Ezra emphasizes that בִּינָה here functions כְּמוֹ הָבֵן ("like 'understand'"), treating it as a command for God to comprehend what human words inadequately convey.

**Verse 3**

הַקְשִׁ֤יבָה ׀ לְק֬וֹל שַׁוְעִ֗י; מַלְכִּ֥י וֵאלֹהָ֑י, כִּֽי־אֵ֝לֶ֗יךָ אֶתְפַּלָּֽל׃

Hearken to the voice of my cry; my King and my God, for to You I pray.

A third imperative—הַקְשִׁ֤יבָה ("hearken")—intensifies the opening's petitionary urgency, now focused on קוֹל שַׁוְעִי ("the voice of my cry"). The term שַׁוְעָה denotes a cry of distress or supplication, used frequently in contexts of mortal danger (cf. 1 Samuel 4:13, where the cry of battle; Exodus 11:6, the great cry of Egypt). The psalmist is not merely speaking or meditating—he is *crying out*, a visceral utterance born of extremity. Yet this cry is not thrown into the void; it is addressed with striking intimacy: מַלְכִּי וֵאלֹהָי ("my King and my God"). The double title fuses political and theological categories. מַלְכִּי invokes the covenantal relationship between Israel and YHWH as sovereign, the divine King to whom subjects appeal for protection and justice. וֵאלֹהָי personalizes this cosmic kingship: "my God," the deity bound to this particular supplicant through covenant and personal devotion. Ibn Ezra comments: מַלְכִּי—שֶׁאַתָּה מֶלֶךְ עָלַי וַאֲנִי צוֹעֵק אֵלֶיךָ כְּמוֹ שֶׁצּוֹעֲקִים אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ ("My King—for You are King over me, and I cry to You as one cries to a king"). This combination of titles was significant enough that it entered Jewish liturgical tradition; the phrase appears in the Edot HaMizrach tradition's Mincha service preparatory prayers: הַקְשִׁיבָה לְקוֹל שַׁוְעִי מַלְכִּי וֵאלֹהָי כִּי־אֵלֶיךָ אֶתְפַּלָּל ("Hear the voice of my cry, my King and my God, for to You I pray"), positioning this verse as a threshold invocation before the Ashrei.

The final clause—כִּֽי־אֵלֶיךָ אֶתְפַּלָּל ("for to You I pray")—grounds the appeal in exclusivity: the psalmist prays to no other power, petitions no alternative deity. The hitpael form אֶתְפַּלָּל emphasizes the reflexive, intensive dimension of this praying: it is a wholehearted, self-involving act. Radak notes: כִּי אֵלֶיךָ רַק אֵלֶיךָ אֶתְפַּלָּל ("For to You—only to You—I pray"). This exclusivity carries theological weight in a context where the psalm will soon contrast YHWH's character with the behavior of the wicked, establishing from the outset that divine address presupposes loyalty to the One who hears.

**Verse 4**

יְֽהֹוָ֗ה בֹּ֭קֶר תִּשְׁמַ֣ע קוֹלִ֑י; בֹּ֥קֶר אֶעֱרׇךְ־לְ֝ךָ֗, וַאֲצַפֶּֽה׃

LORD, at daybreak You hear my voice; at daybreak I order my prayer to You, and watch.

The psalm now reveals its temporal setting with emphatic repetition: בֹּקֶר... בֹּקֶר ("at daybreak... at daybreak"). This double temporal marker, an example of anaphora, anchors the prayer in the liminal hour between night and day, when darkness yields to light. Morning (בֹּקֶר) is not merely a chronological notation but carries symbolic freight across Scripture as the hour of divine intervention and judicial clarity. Rashi notes: בַּבֹּקֶר אֲנִי קוֹרֵא לְךָ עֲלֵיהֶם, שֶׁהוּא עֵת מִשְׁפָּט בָּרְשָׁעִים ("In the morning I call to You about them, because it is the time of judgment for the wicked"), citing Psalm 101:8: לַבְּקָרִים אַצְמִית כׇּל־רִשְׁעֵי־אָרֶץ ("Morning by morning I destroy all the wicked of the land"). Dawn becomes the hour when God sorts the righteous from the wicked, when divine light exposes what darkness concealed.

The verb אֶעֱרׇךְ־לְךָ ("I order/arrange to You") is particularly striking. From the root ע-ר-ך, meaning "to arrange, set in order," this verb appears in cultic contexts for arranging sacrifices on the altar (Leviticus 1:7-8, 6:5: וְעָרַךְ עָלָיו הָעֹלָה, "and arrange the burnt offering upon it"). Ibn Ezra captures this when he notes that the object תְּפִלָּתִי (my prayer) is elided but implied: אֶעֱרׇךְ לְךָ תְּפִלָּתִי ("I will arrange my prayer to You"). The Malbim develops the metaphor: כְּמוֹ שֶׁהַבֹּקֶר יָאִיר אֶת הַחֹשֶׁךְ... כֵּן עֵת יָאִיר אוֹרְךָ, רְשָׁעִים יֹאבְדוּ ("Just as the morning illuminates the darkness... so when Your light shines, the wicked will perish"). Prayer becomes a sacrificial act, carefully prepared and laid out like an offering at the dawn altar. This cultic framing transforms the morning petition into a liturgical rite, a verbal oblation presented at the hour when temple worship would begin.

The final verb—וַאֲצַפֶּה ("and I watch")—from the root צ-פ-ה, means "to look out, keep watch," suggesting the posture of a sentinel awaiting a response. BDB notes its use for prophetic watching (Habakkuk 2:1: אֶתְיַצְּבָה עַל־מִשְׁמַרְתִּי וְאֶתְיַצְּבָה עַל־מָצוֹר וַאֲצַפֶּה, "I will take my stand at my watchpost... and keep watch"). The psalmist does not merely pray and depart; he remains in vigilant expectation, positioned to receive God's response. This posture of watchful waiting entered Jewish liturgical tradition. In the Sefard rite's weekday Shacharit, verse 4 appears in the preparatory prayers: יְהֹוָה בֹּקֶר תִּשְׁמַע קוֹלִי בֹּקֶר אֶעֱרׇךְ לְךָ וַאֲצַפֶּה ("O LORD, at daybreak hear my voice; at daybreak I arrange my prayer to You and watch"), signaling that morning prayer is not merely petition but vigil. The verse thus establishes a threefold rhythm: hear (תִּשְׁמַע), arrange (אֶעֱרׇךְ), watch (וַאֲצַפֶּה)—divine attention, human preparation, expectant waiting.

**Verse 5**

כִּ֤י ׀ לֹ֤א אֵֽל־חָפֵץ־רֶ֥שַׁע ׀ אָ֑תָּה; לֹ֖א יְגֻרְךָ֣ רָֽע׃

For You are not a God who delights in wickedness; evil cannot sojourn with You.

This verse inaugurates a five-verse theological excursus (vv. 5-7) establishing the *character* of the God to whom the psalmist prays—a God whose nature is fundamentally incompatible with evil. The opening כִּי ("for") functions as a causal particle: the psalmist's confidence in divine hearing rests upon God's moral constitution. The negated construction is emphatic: לֹא אֵל־חָפֵץ־רֶשַׁע אָתָּה ("You are not a God who delights in wickedness"). The verb חָפֵץ (to desire, take pleasure in) carries emotional force; BDB notes its use for willing, desiring, even delighting in something. The psalmist denies that YHWH possesses any positive disposition toward רֶשַׁע (wickedness, wrongdoing). This is not merely divine neutrality toward evil but active absence of delight—God's character structurally excludes any affinity for wrongdoing. Ibn Ezra comments: הַטַּעַם שֶׁיֵּשׁ לְךָ לְהָטִיב; הָרֶשַׁע לֹא תַחְפֹּץ ("The meaning is that it is fitting for You to do good; You do not desire wickedness"). This sets YHWH apart from Ancient Near Eastern deities, whose capriciousness often included tolerance or even promotion of chaos and violence.

The second colon intensifies the claim: לֹא יְגֻרְךָ רָע ("evil cannot sojourn with You"). The verb גּוּר means "to sojourn, dwell temporarily," often used of resident aliens (גֵּר) who live among Israel without full citizenship (Genesis 15:13, Exodus 6:4). BDB notes that גּוּר carries the nuance of "dwelling as a new-comer without original rights." Evil cannot even temporarily *reside* in God's presence, let alone dwell permanently. Radak clarifies the idiom: לֹא יָגוּר עִמְּךָ ("will not sojourn with You"). The imagery evokes the entrance liturgies of Psalms 15 and 24, which ask מִי־יָגוּר בְּאׇהֳלֶךָ ("Who may sojourn in Your tent?" Psalm 15:1). But where those psalms enumerate *moral qualifications* for entry, Psalm 5 states categorically that רָע (evil) as a *category* is structurally barred. This is ontological incompatibility: God's holiness renders His presence uninhabitable to evil, as fire is uninhabitable to ice. Malbim develops this polemically: העמים עובדי האלילים היו מייחסים אל האלים שלהם תעתועי רשע וכל המדות הרעות... אבל אני ברוב חסדך אבוא ביתך ("The idolatrous nations attributed evil deceptions and wicked attributes to their gods... but I, through Your abundant mercy, will enter Your house"). The verse thus functions as both theology and polemic, distinguishing YHWH from the morally ambiguous deities of Israel's neighbors while establishing the paradox the psalm will soon articulate: if God is so holy, how can *any* human approach?

**Verse 6**

לֹֽא־יִתְיַצְּב֣וּ ה֭וֹלְלִים לְנֶ֣גֶד עֵינֶ֑יךָ; שָׂ֝נֵ֗אתָ כׇּל־פֹּ֥עֲלֵי אָֽוֶן׃

The boastful cannot stand before Your eyes; You hate all evildoers.

The exclusionary theology intensifies with vivid spatial metaphors. The verb יִתְיַצְּבוּ (hitpael of יצב) means "to station oneself, take one's stand," often used of courtiers or servants standing before a king (Genesis 41:46, 1 Kings 17:1). Radak comments: הַהוֹלְלִים... לֹא יוּכְלוּ לְהִתְיַצֵּב לִפְנֵי עֵינֶיךָ ("The boastful... cannot station themselves before Your eyes"). The phrase לְנֶגֶד עֵינֶיךָ ("before Your eyes") carries courtly overtones—it describes the position of those admitted to the royal presence. Yet ה֭וֹלְלִים (the boastful, the wanton) are barred from this standing. The term, from הלל II (to be boastful, act madly—distinct from הלל I, "to praise"), appears rarely in Scripture (Psalm 73:3, 75:5). The LXX renders it παράνομοι (lawless ones), suggesting those who live outside or in contempt of divine order. Ibn Ezra notes that they "cannot stand in the manner of servants standing before their king" (כְּדֶרֶךְ הָעֲבָדִים נִצָּבִים עַל מַלְכָּם).

The second colon escalates from divine incompatibility to divine *emotion*: שָׂנֵאתָ כׇּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן ("You hate all evildoers"). The verb שָׂנֵא (to hate) is unambiguous—BDB defines it as "to hate (of man or God)." This is not mere exclusion or neutrality but active, volitional antipathy. The object is universalized: כׇּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן ("*all* workers of iniquity"). The phrase פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן, a stock designation in Psalms for the wicked (Psalm 6:9, 14:4, 53:5, 59:3, etc.), depicts evildoers as *craftsmen* of iniquity—their wickedness is not accidental but the product of deliberate labor. The universalizing כׇּל underscores that God's hatred is categorical, not selective: it encompasses every instance of moral perversity. This language is theologically challenging; it attributes to God an emotional posture—hatred—that modern readers often find uncomfortable. Yet the psalmist makes no apology: divine holiness entails not only incompatibility with evil but active, passionate opposition to it. Meiri connects this to the following verse: שֶׁהֵם נְמָאָסִים וּנְתָעָבִים בְּעֵינָיו ("They are despised and abhorred in His eyes"). The verse's parallel structure—"cannot stand" // "You hate"—moves from spatial exclusion to emotional revulsion, constructing a God whose very being repels wickedness.

**Verse 7**

תְּאַבֵּד֮ דֹּבְרֵ֢י כָ֫זָ֥ב; אִישׁ־דָּמִ֥ים וּמִרְמָ֗ה יְתָ֘עֵ֥ב ׀ יְהֹוָֽה׃

You doom those who speak lies; the man of blood and deceit the LORD abhors.

Divine aversion now becomes active judgment. The verb תְּאַבֵּד (Piel of אבד) means "to destroy, cause to perish," and functions here as either imperfect (You *will* destroy) or prophetic perfect (You destroy). Its object is דֹּבְרֵי כָזָב ("speakers of lies/falsehood"). The trilogy of wicked types in vv. 5-7 has been cumulative (הוֹלְלִים, פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן), but now the psalmist specifies *verbal* corruption as the paradigmatic sin: דֹּבְרֵי כָזָב. The noun כָּזָב denotes "lie, falsehood, deception," a violation of the covenantal obligation to truth-telling (Exodus 20:16: לֹא־תַעֲנֶה בְרֵעֲךָ עֵד שָׁקֶר, "You shall not bear false witness"). This focus on speech-corruption will dominate verses 10-11, but here it establishes the theme: those who weaponize language through deception are marked for destruction.

The second colon pairs two categories: אִישׁ־דָּמִים וּמִרְמָה ("the man of blood and deceit"). אִישׁ־דָּמִים is a stock phrase for "murderer, violent man" (Proverbs 29:10; Psalm 26:9, 55:24, 59:3). מִרְמָה (deceit, treachery) again centers verbal sin. Ibn Ezra comments: אִישׁ־דָּמִים וּמִרְמָה הוּא הָרַכִיל ("The man of blood and deceit is the slanderer"), connecting it to Jeremiah 9:7: חֵץ שָׁחוּט לְשׁוֹנָם מִרְמָה דִּבֵּר בְּפִיו ("Their tongue is a sharpened arrow; it speaks deceit"). The pairing of violence (דָּמִים) and deception (מִרְמָה) is significant: the psalmist treats verbal treachery as morally equivalent to bloodshed. This equivalence recurs in the psalm's climactic anatomical dissection of the wicked's speech apparatus (v. 10). Radak notes that this verse describes those "who are abhorred and despised in His eyes" (שֶׁהֵם נִתְעָבִים וּנְמָאָסִים בְּעֵינָיו). The verb יְתָעֵב (to abhor, detest) intensifies שָׂנֵא from v. 6—if God *hates* evildoers, He *abhors* (finds viscerally repugnant) those who combine violence with deceit.

This verse's theological function is crucial: it establishes that God's holiness is not abstract purity but a dynamic force actively opposed to specific evils. The Torah Temimah notes that these verses undergird the rabbinic principle that "four groups do not receive the Divine Presence" (Berakhot 6b): mockers, liars, flatterers, and slanderers—all primarily *speech* sins. Psalm 5:5-7 thus constructs a moral universe where divine presence and human wickedness, especially verbal corruption, are mutually exclusive categories. This sets up the psalm's dramatic turn: if God's holiness is so uncompromising, on what basis can *anyone* approach Him?

**Verse 8**

וַאֲנִ֗י בְּרֹ֣ב חַ֭סְדְּךָ אָב֣וֹא בֵיתֶ֑ךָ; אֶשְׁתַּחֲוֶ֥ה אֶל־הֵֽיכַל־קׇ֝דְשְׁךָ֗ בְּיִרְאָתֶֽךָ׃

But I, through the abundance of Your mercy, will enter Your house; I will bow toward Your holy temple in awe of You.

This verse is the psalm's theological hinge, the pivot that resolves the tension built in vv. 5-7. The emphatic waw-consecutive וַאֲנִי ("But *I*") creates stark contrast: the wicked cannot stand before God (v. 6), but "I"—the psalmist—will enter His house. Yet the basis for this entry is not moral achievement but divine grace: בְּרֹב חַסְדְּךָ ("through the abundance of Your mercy/lovingkindness"). The phrase uses the preposition ב instrumentally—"by means of," "through"—and modifies חֶסֶד with רֹב ("abundance, multitude"). The psalmist's confidence rests entirely on the *magnitude* of God's covenantal love, not on personal righteousness. Radak sharply articulates the contrast: הֵם נְמָאָסִים בְּעֵינֶיךָ, אֲבָל אֲנִי אֶתְיַצֵּב לְעֵינֶיךָ וּלְפָנֶיךָ, אָבוֹא בֵיתֶךָ בְּרֹב חַסְדְּךָ ("They are despised in Your eyes, but as for me, I will take my stand in Your sight and before You; I will enter Your house through the abundance of Your mercy"). The word חֶסֶד carries covenantal freight—it is the loyal, steadfast love that binds YHWH to Israel, the divine commitment that persists despite human failure.

The verbs mark a progression: אָבוֹא בֵיתֶךָ ("I will enter Your house"), then אֶשְׁתַּחֲוֶה אֶל־הֵיכַל־קׇדְשְׁךָ ("I will bow toward Your holy temple"). The first describes physical entry into the temple precincts; the second, liturgical prostration oriented toward the inner sanctuary (הֵיכָל, the temple proper). The phrase בְּיִרְאָתֶךָ ("in awe/fear of You") modifies the bowing, establishing that worship is not casual but conducted with reverential dread. Ibn Ezra notes the contrast: אֵין לִי מִנְחָה רַק לְהוֹדוֹת בְּרֹב חַסְדְּךָ עָלָי... אֵין לִי בַּמָּה אֶשְׁתַּחֲוֶה רַק בְּיִרְאָתִי מִמְּךָ ("I have no offering but to thank You for the abundance of Your mercy upon me... I have nothing with which to bow down except my fear of You"). The worshipper enters not with sacrificial gifts but with gratitude and awe—the only "offerings" grace permits.

This verse became liturgically central. In the Ma Tovu prayer recited upon entering the synagogue (both Ashkenaz and Sefard), verse 8 immediately follows the opening acclamation: וַאֲנִי בְּרֹב חַסְדְּךָ אָבוֹא בֵיתֶךָ אֶשְׁתַּחֲוֶה אֶל־הֵיכַל־קָדְשְׁךָ בְּיִרְאָתֶךָ ("But I, through the abundance of Your mercy, shall enter Your house; I shall bow toward Your holy temple in awe of You"). This liturgical usage transforms the psalmist's declaration into a daily threshold petition, a statement of posture as one crosses into sacred space. The Malbim develops the theological contrast between pagan worship and Israelite devotion: עוֹבֵד הָאֱלִיל יַעַבְדֶנּוּ וְיִתְפַּלֵּל אֵלָיו מִצַּד יִרְאָתוֹ מִן הָרַע... אֲבָל אֲנִי בְּרֹב חַסְדְּךָ אָבוֹא בֵיתֶךָ ("The idol worshiper serves and prays to it out of fear of evil... but I, through the abundance of Your mercy, will enter Your house"). Where pagan worship is motivated by terror, Israelite worship is grounded in divine chesed—God's gracious initiative makes entry possible.

The verse's paradox is exquisite: after establishing God's uncompromising holiness (vv. 5-7), the psalm declares human access possible—but only through divine mercy. This is the proto-Reformed insight embedded in Israelite psalmody: grace precedes and enables worship. The psalmist does not *earn* entry; he *receives* it.

**Verse 9**

יְהֹוָ֤ה ׀ נְחֵ֬נִי בְצִדְקָתֶ֗ךָ לְמַ֥עַן שׁוֹרְרָ֑י; (הושר) [הַיְשַׁ֖ר] לְפָנַ֣י דַּרְכֶּֽךָ׃

LORD, lead me in Your righteousness because of my watchful foes; make Your way straight before me.

Having established grace-based access (v. 8), the psalmist now petitions for *guidance*, not merely presence. The imperative נְחֵנִי (lead me) from the root נחה (to lead, guide), appears frequently in contexts of divine shepherding (Psalm 23:2-3: יְנַהֲלֵנִי, "He leads me"; Exodus 13:21, where YHWH leads Israel through the wilderness). The request is not for God to *accompany* the psalmist but to *direct* him: בְצִדְקָתֶךָ ("in/by Your righteousness"). Ibn Ezra emphasizes the instrumental ב: תְּחִלַּת תְּפִלָּתִי שֶׁתַּנְחֵנִי בְּדֶרֶךְ צִדְקָתֶךָ ("The essence of my prayer is that You lead me in the way of Your righteousness"). This is a prayer not for vindication but for sanctification—the psalmist asks to be led along a righteous path, to have his conduct shaped by divine standards, not merely judged by them. Radak glosses: שֶׁתְּסַיְּעֵנִי לָלֶכֶת דֶּרֶךְ צְדָקָה וּמִשְׁפָּט ("That You help me to walk the way of righteousness and justice").

The motivation clause לְמַעַן שׁוֹרְרָי ("because of my watchful foes") introduces the enemies explicitly. The term שׁוֹרְרַי, from the root שׁור (to watch, lie in wait), designates hostile observers—those who scrutinize the psalmist's conduct hoping to witness a moral failure. Rashi connects it to Numbers 24:17: שׁוֹרְרָי כְּמוֹ אֲשׁוּרֶנּוּ וְלֹא קָרוֹב ("My watchers—like 'I behold him, but he is not near'"). Ibn Ezra clarifies: כִּי אֶפְחַד שֶׁתִּמְעַד רַגְלִי וְתַעֲנִישֵׁנִי, אָז יִשְׂמְחוּ שׁוֹרְרָי ("For I fear my foot will slip and You will punish me; then my watchers will rejoice"). The enemies' malicious watchfulness creates existential vulnerability—any misstep becomes their vindication. This external threat makes the petition for guidance urgent: without divine direction, the psalmist risks moral failure that his enemies will weaponize.

The second colon's syntax is disputed. The MT reads הושר (from יָשַׁר, "make straight") but many manuscripts prefer הַיְשַׁר (imperative hifil, as in the Qere). The phrase לְפָנַי דַּרְכֶּךָ ("Your way before me") employs the common biblical metaphor of דֶּרֶךְ (way, path) for moral conduct or divine guidance. The psalmist asks God to "straighten" or "make level" His path *before* the psalmist—to remove obstacles, clarify the route, eliminate ambiguity. Radak comments: הַיְשַׁר לְפָנַי דַּרְכֶּךָ—שֶׁלֹּא יִהְיֶה בַּדֶּרֶךְ עִקּוּב וְהַרְכָּסִים ("Make Your way straight before me—that there be no crookedness or ruggedness in the path"). The Malbim develops the metaphor theologically: יִתְעֶה אָדָם מִן הַדֶּרֶךְ, אוֹ מִצַּד הַשְּׁגִיאָה שֶׁאֵינוֹ יוֹדֵעַ הַדֶּרֶךְ... אוֹ גַם בְּיָדְעוֹ הַדֶּרֶךְ אִם יֵשׁ שָׁם מוֹנְעִים עָקֹב וְרִכְסִים ("A person may stray from the path either through error—not knowing the way—or, even knowing the way, if there are obstacles and barriers"). The double petition thus requests both internal guidance (lead me in righteousness) and external clarity (straighten the path).

**Verse 10**

כִּ֤י אֵ֪ין בְּפִ֡יהוּ נְכוֹנָה֮; קִרְבָּ֢ם הַ֫וּ֥וֹת, קֶֽבֶר־פָּת֥וּחַ גְּרֹנָ֑ם; לְ֝שׁוֹנָ֗ם יַחֲלִיקֽוּן׃

For there is no sincerity in their mouth; their inward part is malice, their throat is an open grave; they make their tongue smooth.

This verse presents an extraordinary *anatomical dissection* of verbal corruption, cataloging the physiology of deceitful speech from interior motive to exterior utterance. The opening כִּי ("for") grounds the preceding petition (v. 9) in the nature of the enemies: guidance is needed *because* these adversaries are fundamentally untrustworthy. The phrase אֵין בְּפִיהוּ נְכוֹנָה employs the negation אֵין with נְכוֹנָה (something established, reliable, true—from כּוּן, "to be firm"). Radak glosses: אֵין בְּפִי אַחַד מֵהֶם נְכוֹנָה אֶלָּא מַרְאִים עַצְמָם בְּפִיהֶם כְּאוֹהֲבִים ("There is no reliability in the mouth of even one of them; rather, they present themselves with their mouths as if they were friends"). The mouth *appears* to speak friendship, but this is performance, not substance.

The progression moves *inward*: קִרְבָּם הַוּוֹת ("their inward part is malice/destruction"). The term קֶרֶב typically designates the inner organs, the viscera, and by extension the hidden thoughts and intentions (cf. Psalm 64:7: וְקֶרֶב אִישׁ וְלֵב עָמֹק, "and a man's inward part and heart are deep"). Here it is predicated with הַוּוֹת, from the root הוה (to be, become), which in this nominal form designates "destruction, calamity, ruin" (BDB). The LXX renders it δόλος (deceit), suggesting their inner part is treacherous intent. Radak comments: רָעוֹת חוֹשְׁבִים בְּלִבָּם ("They devise evil in their hearts"). The outward speech and the inward intention are radically discontinuous—the mouth says one thing while the heart plots another.

Then the extraordinary metaphor: קֶבֶר־פָּתוּחַ גְּרֹנָם ("their throat is an open grave"). This arresting image likens the *throat* (גָּרוֹן, the physical passage from mouth to lungs) to a פֶּה פָּתוּחַ (open grave)—a yawning pit of death. Radak explicates: מִי שֶׁלֹּא יִשָּׁמֵר מֵהֶם וְיִשְׁמַע אוֹתָם כְּשֶׁיַּחֲלִיקוּ לְשׁוֹנָם... יִפֹּל בְּקִבְרָם, וְהוּא מַחֲשֶׁבֶת לִבָּם ("Whoever does not guard himself from them and listens to them when they smooth their tongue... will fall into their grave, which is the thought of their heart"). The throat becomes an instrument of consumption, swallowing victims into death. Jeremiah 5:16 uses similar language: אַשְׁפָּתוֹ כְּקֶבֶר פָּתוּחַ ("Their quiver is like an open grave"), connecting arrows with deadly words. Paul famously cites Psalm 5:10 in Romans 3:13 as part of his catalogue of universal human corruption: τάφος ἀνεῳγμένος ὁ λάρυγξ αὐτῶν ("Their throat is an open grave"), suggesting the image transcended its Israelite context to become paradigmatic of human speech's destructive potential.

The final colon returns to the tongue: לְשׁוֹנָם יַחֲלִיקוּן ("they make smooth their tongue"). The verb חלק means "to be smooth, slippery," and in the hifil יַחֲלִיקוּן, "to make smooth" or "to flatter." BDB notes the term describes "words smooth, i.e., deceptive" (Psalm 55:22: חָלְקוּ מַחְמָאֹת פִּיו, "his mouth was smoother than butter"). The smoothness is not a compliment but an indictment—the tongue is *too* smooth, words that slide past scrutiny, that seduce and mislead. Metzudat David comments: בִּלְשׁוֹנָם יְדַבְּרוּ חֲלַקְלַקּוֹת וְאֵינָם יוֹצְאִין מִן הַלֵּב ("With their tongue they speak smooth words, but they do not come from the heart"). The four-part anatomy—mouth, inward part, throat, tongue—constructs a comprehensive portrait of duplicity, where every level of speech production is corrupted, from motive (קֶרֶב) to mechanism (גָּרוֹן, לָשׁוֹן) to output (פֶּה). This verse establishes *verbal treachery* as the psalm's paradigmatic sin, the specific evil from which the psalmist needs protection (v. 9).

**Verse 11**

הַ֥אֲשִׁימֵ֨ם ׀ אֱֽלֹהִ֗ים; יִפְּלוּ֮ מִֽמֹּעֲצ֢וֹתֵ֫יהֶ֥ם, בְּרֹ֣ב פִּ֭שְׁעֵיהֶם הַדִּיחֵ֑מוֹ, כִּי־מָ֥רוּ בָֽךְ׃

Condemn them, O God; let them fall by their own devices; cast them out for their many crimes, for they have rebelled against You.

The petition shifts from description (v. 10) to imprecation—a direct call for divine judgment on the enemies. The opening הַאֲשִׁימֵם is a hifil imperative of אָשַׁם (to be guilty, bear guilt), meaning "declare them guilty, condemn them, hold them accountable." BDB notes the hifil can mean "bring guilt upon" or "condemn," though some interpreters (Rashi, following Midrash) derive it from שָׁמֵם (to devastate): יֵשׁ מְפָרְשִׁים מִלְּשׁוֹן שְׁמָמָה ("Some interpret it from the root 'desolation'"). But the legal sense is primary: the psalmist petitions God, as divine Judge, to render a verdict of guilt. Radak suggests the nuance: הַאֲשִׁימֵם בַּעֲצָתָם, כְּלוֹמַר שֶׁלֹּא יִתָּכֵן וְלֹא יִזְדַּמֵּן לָהֶם מַה שֶּׁחָשְׁבוּ לַעֲשׂוֹת עָלַי ("Condemn them in their counsel, meaning that what they plotted to do to me should not succeed or materialize").

Three jussives follow, each depicting the enemies' downfall. First, יִפְּלוּ מִמֹּעֲצוֹתֵיהֶם ("let them fall by their own devices"). The verb נפל (to fall) suggests collapse, defeat, or death (cf. 1 Samuel 31:4: וַיִּפְּלוּ חֲלָלִים רַבִּים, "and many slain fell"). The phrase מִמֹּעֲצוֹתֵיהֶם (from their own counsels/plans) invokes the principle of *lex talionis* or poetic justice—they fall *through* (מִן, instrumental) the very schemes they devised against others. This recalls Psalm 7:16: בּוֹר כָּרָה וַיַּחְפְּרֵהוּ, וַיִּפֹּל בְּשַׁחַת יִפְעָל ("He dug a pit and deepened it, and fell into the trap he made"). Second, בְּרֹב פִּשְׁעֵיהֶם הַדִּיחֵמוֹ ("for their many crimes, cast them out"). The hifil imperative הַדִּיחֵמוֹ (from נדח) means "thrust out, banish, drive away"—forcible expulsion from the community or from God's presence. The phrase בְּרֹב פִּשְׁעֵיהֶם ("for the abundance of their transgressions") deliberately echoes verse 8's בְּרֹב חַסְדְּךָ ("through the abundance of Your mercy"). Radak comments on the mirroring: 'בְּרֹב פִּשְׁעֵיהֶם' הֶעְתֵּק מֵ'בְּרֹב חַסְדְּךָ,' אֲבָל מִדָּה כְנֶגֶד מִדָּה ("'For the abundance of their transgressions' corresponds to 'through the abundance of Your mercy,' but as measure for measure"). Where abundant mercy grants the psalmist entry (v. 8), abundant transgression merits the enemies' expulsion. This structural parallelism—mercy's abundance vs. sin's abundance—underscores the psalm's binary moral universe.

The final clause—כִּי־מָרוּ בָךְ ("for they have rebelled against You")—provides the ultimate rationale. The verb מרה means "to be rebellious, refractory, contentious" (BDB), often used of Israel's rebellion in the wilderness (Numbers 20:10, 24; 27:14). The enemies' sin is not merely interpersonal but theological: they have *rebelled against God Himself*. Radak clarifies: בִּשְׂנָאָתָם אוֹתִי, וְאַתָּה צִוִּיתָ עָלַי לִהְיוֹת מֶלֶךְ, וְהֵם מָרוּ אֶת־דְּבָרֶיךָ ("In their hatred of me—when You commanded me to be king, and they rebelled against Your word"). Their hostility to the psalmist is hostility to God's will, making the imprecation not personal vengeance but alignment with divine justice. The imprecatory prayer thus functions theologically: the psalmist does not curse his enemies in personal pique but calls upon God to enforce the covenant, to vindicate divine sovereignty against those who *mārû bākh* (rebelled against You).

**Verse 12**

וְיִשְׂמְח֨וּ כׇל־ח֪וֹסֵי בָ֡ךְ, לְעוֹלָ֣ם יְ֭רַנֵּנוּ וְתָסֵ֣ךְ עָלֵ֑ימוֹ; וְֽיַעְלְצ֥וּ בְ֝ךָ֗ אֹהֲבֵ֥י שְׁמֶֽךָ׃

But let all who take refuge in You rejoice; let them ever sing for joy, and may You shelter them; let those who love Your name exult in You.

The psalm pivots abruptly from imprecation (v. 11) to jubilant vision (vv. 12-13), shifting from judgment on the wicked to celebration of the righteous. Three jussive verbs—וְיִשְׂמְחוּ ("let them rejoice"), יְרַנֵּנוּ ("let them sing for joy"), וְיַעְלְצוּ ("let them exult")—cascade in a torrent of joy vocabulary. The subjects are כׇל־חוֹסֵי בָךְ ("all who take refuge in You"), a phrase that *defines righteousness* not by moral achievement but by *posture* and *relationship*. The participle חוֹסֵי, from חסה (to seek refuge, take shelter), appears frequently in Psalms to describe those who flee to God for protection (Psalm 2:12, 7:2, 11:1, 16:1, 17:7, 18:3, etc.). BDB notes its use of "seeking refuge from danger, with God as protector." This is *relational* righteousness—the righteous are those who *trust*, who run to God as their shelter. Ibn Ezra comments: הַצַּדִּיקִים הַחוֹסִים בְּךָ ("The righteous who take refuge in You"), equating refuge-seeking with righteousness itself.

The temporal scope is universal: לְעוֹלָם יְרַנֵּנוּ ("let them sing for joy forever"). The verb רנן (to give a ringing cry, sing aloud) denotes exuberant, unrestrained vocal celebration—the joyful shout of triumph (Psalm 33:1, 51:16, 59:17). The phrase לְעוֹלָם establishes this joy as *perpetual*, not momentary. God's action sustains it: וְתָסֵךְ עָלֵימוֹ ("and may You shelter them"). The verb סכך means "to cover, screen, protect" (cf. Exodus 40:3, where the veil *screens* the ark). Radak explains: שֶׁתִּהְיֶה עֲלֵיהֶם כְּסֻכָּה, שֶׁלֹּא יַזִּיקוּ לָהֶם הָאוֹיְבִים ("That You be over them as a sukkah, so the enemies cannot harm them"). The sukkah image evokes both *protection* (shade from sun, shelter from rain) and *intimacy* (dwelling close to God). This verb's appearance here echoes the psalm's opening: the psalmist sought God's hearing (v. 2); now God's *sheltering* (תָסֵךְ) is the guarantee that the refuge-takers' joy is secure.

The final jussive—וְיַעְלְצוּ בְךָ אֹהֲבֵי שְׁמֶךָ ("let those who love Your name exult in You")—adds a third designation for the righteous: אֹהֲבֵי שְׁמֶךָ ("those who love Your name"). The verse has now used *three* appellations: חוֹסֵי בָךְ (refuge-takers), those sheltered by God (implied subject of וְתָסֵךְ), and אֹהֲבֵי שְׁמֶךָ (name-lovers). These are not distinct groups but overlapping descriptions of the same reality—those who trust God, whom God protects, and who love Him. The verb עלץ (to exult, rejoice) appears in contexts of triumph and celebration (1 Samuel 2:1, Psalm 9:3, 68:4). Metzudat David comments: בִּתְשׁוּעָתְךָ ("In Your salvation"). The preposition בְּךָ ("in You") indicates that the exultation is not merely *about* God but occurs *within* the sphere of divine presence—the joy is participatory, an experience of being enfolded in God's life.

This verse entered Jewish liturgical tradition prominently. It appears in multiple Selichot traditions and is recited in contexts of communal prayer across Ashkenaz and Sefard rites, where it functions as a vision of eschatological vindication: the ultimate triumph of those who trust YHWH. The verse's structure—judgment of enemies (v. 11) followed by celebration of the faithful (v. 12)—enacts the psalm's binary moral theology: exclusion of the wicked, embrace of the righteous, with the latter's status defined entirely by their posture of trust and love toward God.

**Verse 13**

כִּֽי־אַתָּה֮ תְּבָרֵ֢ךְ צַ֫דִּ֥יק יְהֹוָ֑ה; כַּ֝צִּנָּ֗ה רָצ֥וֹן תַּעְטְרֶֽנּוּ׃

For You bless the righteous, O LORD; as with a shield, with favor You encompass him.

The psalm's final verse grounds the preceding vision of joy (v. 12) in divine action: כִּי־אַתָּה תְּבָרֵךְ צַדִּיק יְהֹוָה ("for *You* bless the righteous, O LORD"). The emphatic אַתָּה foregrounds divine agency—the blessing originates entirely with God. The verb בָּרַךְ (to bless) here functions as an imperfect indicating habitual or characteristic action: this is what God *does*. The object is צַדִּיק (the righteous), which appears for the first time in the psalm. After spending the psalm defining the faithful as "refuge-takers" (v. 12) and those who "love Your name" (v. 12), the psalmist finally deploys the technical term צַדִּיק. But the semantic content has been filled by the preceding verses: the צַדִּיק is not one who achieves moral perfection but one who takes refuge in God (v. 12), who enters God's house through His abundant mercy (v. 8), and who orients life toward the divine. Radak connects this to the previous verse: אָז יַעַלְצוּ בְךָ כַּאֲשֶׁר תְּבָרֵךְ צַדִּיק וְתָדִיחַ הָרָשָׁע ("Then they will exult in You when You bless the righteous and thrust out the wicked").

The second colon employs a double metaphor: כַּצִּנָּה רָצוֹן תַּעְטְרֶנּוּ ("as with a shield, with favor You encompass him"). The shield (צִנָּה) was the large, full-body shield used by infantry in ancient warfare (1 Kings 10:16; 2 Chronicles 9:15), distinct from the smaller מָגֵן (buckler). The צִנָּה covered the warrior from head to foot, providing comprehensive protection. Rashi comments: הַמַּקֶּפֶת שָׁלֹשׁ רוּחוֹתָיו שֶׁל אָדָם ("Which surrounds three sides of a person"). But the *substance* of this shield is רָצוֹן ("favor, acceptance, goodwill")—an abstraction made concrete. BDB defines רָצוֹן as "goodwill, favor, acceptance," the disposition of pleasure or approval. God's favor itself becomes the protective barrier, not as metaphysical speculation but as experiential reality: the one who enjoys divine favor is shielded from ultimate harm. The Meiri explicates: כְּמוֹ שֶׁהַצִּנָּה מְקַפֶּת וְעוֹטֶרֶת הַנּוֹשֵׂא אוֹתָהּ, כֵּן תַּעְטוּר וְתַקִּיף הַצַּדִּיק בִּרְצוֹנְךָ ("Just as the shield encircles and crowns the one bearing it, so You encircle and surround the righteous with Your favor").

The verb תַּעְטְרֶנּוּ (from עטר) means "to crown" or "to encompass, encircle." The term is polysemous: it can denote either placing a crown *upon* someone (Psalm 8:6: וְכָבוֹד וְהָדָר תְּעַטְּרֵהוּ, "and with glory and majesty You crown him") or *surrounding* someone, as in 1 Samuel 23:26: וְשָׁאוּל וַאֲנָשָׁיו עֹטְרִים אֶל־דָּוִד ("and Saul and his men were encircling David"). Rashi takes it in the latter sense: תְּסוֹבְבֶנּוּ כְּמוֹ עֹטְרִים אֶל דָּוִד ("You will surround him, as in 'encircling David'"). The ambiguity is generative: divine favor both *honors* (crowns) and *protects* (encircles)—it is simultaneously status and security. The LXX renders it στεφανώσεις ("you will crown"), emphasizing the honorific dimension. Ibn Ezra notes some read תַּעְטְרֶנּוּ as qal (passive, "he is crowned"), though most understand it as hifil (active, "You crown/encircle him").

This verse became liturgically significant. It appears in the daily liturgy as part of the Birkat Kohanim response in Sefard traditions, where the congregation recites it following the Priestly Blessing. The placement is theologically apt: after the priests pronounce God's blessing (Numbers 6:24-26), the people respond by affirming that God indeed blesses the righteous and shields them with favor. The verse thus functions as both theological claim and liturgical confidence: the righteous can trust that divine blessing is not wishful thinking but enacted reality, a shield-favor that encompasses them on all sides. The psalm that began with urgent petition (vv. 2-4) closes with confident assertion: God *will* bless, God *will* encompass. The psalmist's morning cry (v. 4) receives its answer in this final assurance of divine protection.
