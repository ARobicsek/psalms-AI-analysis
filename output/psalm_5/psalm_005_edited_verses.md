**Verse 1**

לַמְנַצֵּחַ אֶל־הַנְּחִילֹות; מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד.

The superscription gives us a setting and a riddle. לַמְנַצֵּחַ (“for the leader/choirmaster”) marks this as public performance under professional direction; מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד places it in the Davidic collection. אֶל־הַנְּחִילוֹת is the riddle. The Greek translators took a stray path—“concerning the one who inherits”—as if from נַחֲלָה (inheritance), an unlikely fit. Medieval Jews offered two plausible tracks: a musical term (Rashi; Ibn Ezra) or a sound-image (Rav Hai Gaon; Radak) from נְחִיל דְּבוֹרִים, a “swarm of bees,” evoking a rapid, buzzing texture. Modern lexicography leaves it unresolved, tentatively linking it to flutes (חָלִיל). What matters for reading is the first word: the psalm is not a private murmur; it is liturgical speech. That orientation colors the early verbs (v. 4’s “I will arrange [my prayer] before You”) and the closing wish for communal joy (v. 12). It is also worth noticing the superscriptions’ realism: they often preserve performance notes whose meanings we have lost. The paradox of the psalter is here compressed—a sung prayer that belongs to the assembly, and yet one voice, “I,” for whom the first business of the day is to be heard.

**Verse 2**

אֲמָרַי הַאֲזִינָה יְהוָה; בִּינָה הֲגִיגִי.

The parallel cola move from words to what precedes words. “אֲמָרַי הַאֲזִינָה” asks YHWH to “give ear” (from אוזן) to spoken utterances; “בִּינָה הֲגִיגִי” asks Him to “understand” (imperative of בין) the inner murmur. הֲגִיג (from הגה) appears again in Ps 39:4: “בַּהֲגִיגִי תִּבְעַר אֵשׁ” — “While I was musing, a fire burned.” The Psalmist’s realism is pastoral: much of what we need to pray resists articulation; God must interpret it. The verbs are nicely chosen. “Give ear” is bodily—a God bending toward whispering speech. “Understand” is cognitive—God must do the hermeneutic work. Traditional commentators already heard this progression. Radak: “מַה שֶׁאוֹצִיא בְּפִי הַאֲזִינָה, וּמַה שֶׁאֶהְגֶּה בְּלִבִּי בִּינָה” — “What I utter with my mouth—give ear; what I meditate in my heart—understand.” The line invites the reader to think of prayer not as a performance delivered to a passive deity but as a collaboration in which the petitioner orders his words and God attends to the stirrings that exceed them. It is no accident that penitential liturgy borrows this language for communal confession: “אֲמָרֵינוּ הַאֲזִינָה… בִּינָה הֲגִיגֵנוּ” — “Give ear to our words… consider our meditation.” The psalm’s opening looses a generous doctrine: that prayer’s most honest part may be the part that never leaves the chest.

**Verse 3**

הַקְשִׁיבָה לְקוֹל שַׁוְעִי; מַלְכִּי וֵאלֹהָי; כִּי־אֵלֶיךָ אֶתְפַּלָּל.

A second hearing-verb, הַקְשִׁיבָה (“give heed”), raises the intensity: not only words, not only meditation, but “the voice of my cry” (שַׁוְעִי). The cry שַׁוְעָה connotes emergency. What makes this plea intimate is the double title: “מַלְכִּי וֵאלֹהָי” — “my King and my God.” The phrase also appears in Ps 84:4 (Eng. 84:3): “גַּם־צִפּוֹר מָצְאָה בַיִת… יְהוָה צְבָאוֹת מַלְכִּי וֵאלֹהָי” — “Even the bird has found a home… LORD of Hosts, my King and my God.” Here, covenantal sovereignty (“my King”) and personal deity (“my God”) fuse. The final clause states the exclusivity of address: “for to You I pray” (hitpael of פלל, an intensive/reflexive form). Ibn Ezra hears this as an avowal of loyalty: there is no other addressee, no other court. In Eastern liturgy, the verse serves as a preface to the Amidah—fittingly, for the Amidah is both petition and enthronement. The structure of the three opening verses is worth noting as a small example of poetic “staircase” parallelism (a form in which each colon builds on the previous). “Give ear… understand… give heed to the voice of my cry”: a carefully stepped intensification.

**Verse 4**

יְהוָה, בֹּקֶר תִּשְׁמַע קוֹלִי; בֹּקֶר אֶעֱרָךְ־לְךָ; וַאֲצַפֶּה.

The morning anaphora (repetition) — “בֹּקֶר… בֹּקֶר” — sets the hour and, with it, the posture. First, “You hear my voice” at dawn; then, “I arrange [my prayer]” (אֶעֱרָךְ) like a priest lays out a sacrifice (Lev 1:7–8); finally, “I watch” (וַאֲצַפֶּה), from צפה, to keep a lookout. The sequence gives the movement of worship: God’s attention → my careful preparation → my expectant waiting. Two biblical resonances amplify the cultic shading: “תִּכּוֹן תְּפִלָּתִי קְטֹרֶת לְפָנֶיךָ” — “Let my prayer be set like incense before You” (Ps 141:2), and the prophetic watch-post: “עַל־מִשְׁמַרְתִּי אֶעֱמֹדָה… וַאֲצַפֶּה” — “I will stand at my watch… and I will watch” (Hab 2:1). Chanted, the line bears its own cadence: the stressed beats in the Masoretic accent land on “בֹּ֥קֶר” and “וַאֲצַפֶּֽה,” giving the day its pulse. Theological cautions hide in the grammar: prayer is not merely outpouring; it must be ordered; and piety’s last move is not frenetic action but watchful patience.

**Verse 5**

כִּי לֹא אֵל־חָפֵץ רֶשַׁע אַתָּה; לֹא יְגֻרְךָ רָע.

A compressed creed. God does not “desire” (חָפֵץ) wickedness; evil cannot “sojourn” (גור) with Him. The second verb is programmatic. גור is the verb of the ger (resident alien), and the Psalms harness it to the question of temple approach: “יְהוָה, מִי־יָגוּר בְּאָהֳלֶךָ?” (Ps 15:1). Psalm 5 gives the ontological answer: evil, as such, cannot reside in that presence. Malbim (19th c.) pressed the contrast with pagan myth: Israel’s God is not a composite of capricious forces that include malign appetites; holiness is not a slice of cosmic chaos; the God of Israel is morally intelligent. Radak makes it personal: if God finds no pleasure in wickedness, then He will not delight in those enemies (the psalmist’s own) whose behaviors are named in the next couplets. The verse also begins a pattern of negatives (“לֹא… לֹא”) that builds a strong rhetorical fence—evil is excluded from divine intimacy in both dwelling and delight.

**Verse 6**

לֹא־יִתְיַצְּבוּ הוֹלְלִים לְנֶגֶד עֵינֶיךָ; שָׂנֵאתָ כָּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן.

The imagery turns courtly. “They cannot take their stand (יִתְיַצְּבוּ) before Your eyes”: the verb (hitpael of יצב) is the posture of courtiers. The eyes (“before Your eyes”) are the royal gaze. הוֹלְלִים can be “boasters” (distinct from the praise-verb הִלֵּל) or “insolent fools.” Either way, they are barred. The emotional register tightens: “You hate all workers of iniquity.” The noun phrase פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן (“workers of wrongdoing”) is a psalmic stock; the force lies in the universal “all.” The psalms elsewhere echo the same courtroom vocabulary for enemies: “לֹא־יִתְיַצֵּב אִישׁ בִּפְנֵיכֶם” — “No one shall stand up before you” (Deut 11:25). Here, the King’s aversion is the definitive exclusion. Readers who stumble over the word “hate” should hear it as covenantal antipathy: a moral God takes sides against what destroys the human face.

**Verse 7**

תְּאַבֵּד דֹּבְרֵי כָזָב; אִישׁ דָּמִים וּמִרְמָה יְתַעֵב יְהוָה.

The catalogue sharpens: liars and a “man of blood and deceit.” The pairing is not accidental. Psalm 55 closes with the same duo: “אַנְשֵׁי דָמִים וּמִרְמָה לֹא־יֶחֱצוּ יְמֵיהֶם” — “Men of blood and deceit shall not live out half their days” (Ps 55:24). Jeremiah’s line about the tongue completes the triangle: “חֵץ שָׁחוּט לְשׁוֹנָם; מִרְמָה דִּבֵּר” — “Their tongue is a sharpened arrow; it speaks deceit” (Jer 9:7). The psalmist’s moral imagination equates weaponized language and bloodshed. The verbs escalate: “You destroy” (תְּאַבֵּד), “the LORD abhors” (יְתַעֵב). Torah Temimah folds verses like these into a rabbinic principle: certain habits of speech—scoffing, flattery, lying, slander—disqualify a person from encountering the Shekhinah (Berakhot 6b). It is difficult to overstate how consistently the Psalms teach that social speech is a spiritual barometer.

**Verse 8**

וַאֲנִי בְּרֹב חַסְדְּךָ אָבוֹא בֵיתֶךָ; אֶשְׁתַּחֲוֶה אֶל־הֵיכַל־קׇדְשְׁךָ בְּיִרְאָתֶךָ.

This is the hinge. “But I”—the adversative וַאֲנִי is the turn from exclusion to access—“through the abundance of Your ḥesed, shall enter Your house.” The instrumental בְּ (“by means of”) says what needs to be said: the worshiper’s entry is grace-based. Two verbs describe the arc of worship: “I enter” the precinct; “I bow” toward the inner sanctuary. בְּיִרְאָתֶךָ adds the affect—“in awe.” In Jewish practice, this verse plants itself at the synagogue door in Ma Tovu, the threshold prayer: we do not claim entry by consistency of virtue but by the abundance of covenant mercy. The line sits consciously beside the entrance catechisms of Psalms 15 and 24. Psalm 15 answers “Who may sojourn?” with a moral profile; Psalm 5 says, “As for me, I enter by Your ḥesed.” The difference is not contradiction but stereophony: righteousness matters; grace ushers.

**Verse 9**

יְהוָה, נְחֵנִי בְצִדְקָתֶךָ לְמַעַן שׁוֹרְרָי; הַיְשַׁר לְפָנַי דַּרְכֶּךָ.

The prayer now asks to be formed, not merely protected. “Lead me” (נחה) “in Your righteousness,” and “make straight” Your way before me. The “watchers” (שׁוֹרְרַי) are hostile onlookers who lie in wait to gloat at a slip. The pairing of guidance and straightness recalls Ps 27:11: “הוֹרֵנִי יְהוָה דַּרְכֶּךָ; וּנְחֵנִי בְּאֹרַח מִישֹׁור” — “Teach me Your way, O LORD; and lead me on a level path.” The Qere of our line (הַיְשַׁר) is an imperative of the hiphil (“make straight”). The metaphors are spatial because the moral life is a kind of walking. In Sefard usage, the verse accompanies congregants as they step back into weekday life after prayer: “יְהוָה נְחֵנִי בְצִדְקָתֶךָ… הַיְשַׁר לְפָנַי דַּרְכֶּךָ.” The liturgy thus turns the psalm’s moral geography into a daily request.

**Verse 10**

כִּי אֵין בְּפִיהוּ נְכוֹנָה; קִרְבָּם הַוּוֹת; קֶבֶר־פָּתוּחַ גְּרוֹנָם; לְשׁוֹנָם יַחֲלִיקוּן.

An autopsy of duplicity. The mouth (פֶּה) has no “steadfastness” (נְכוֹנָה; from כון, “firmness”); the inner parts (קֶרֶב) are “destructions” (הַוּוֹת); the throat (גָּרוֹן) is “an open grave”; and the tongue (לָשׁוֹן) they “make smooth.” Two parallel texts illuminate the imagery. Jeremiah’s “quiver like an open grave” (Jer 5:16) links instruments of death and the hungry mouth of burial—ominous appetite disguised as speech. Psalm 55:22: “חָלְקוּ מַחְמָאוֹת פִּיו… רַכּוּ דְבָרָיו מִשֶּׁמֶן וְהֵמָּה פְתִחוֹת” — “Smoother than butter were his words… softer than oil were his words, yet they are drawn swords.” Psalm 12:3 heightens: “דַּבֵּר שָׁוְא אִישׁ אֶת־רֵעֵהוּ; שְׂפַת חֲלָקוֹת, בְּלֵב וָלֵב” — “Everyone speaks falsehood with his neighbor; with smooth lip, with a double heart.” Our psalm compresses all three: seduction (“smooth”), duplicity (“double-hearted”), and the devouring void (“open grave”). The somatic progression (mouth → inner parts → throat → tongue) maps motive into mechanism into output. Radak sees a moral trap: those who are not on guard “when they smooth their tongue… will fall into their grave,” i.e., into the designs of their heart.

**Verse 11**

הַאֲשִׁימֵם אֱלֹהִים; יִפְּלוּ מִמֹּעֲצוֹתֵיהֶם; בְּרֹב פִּשְׁעֵיהֶם הַדִּיחֵמוֹ; כִּי־מָרוּ בָּךְ.

Imprecation is ethically hard; Psalm 5 makes it judicial. The first verb (הַאֲשִׁימֵם) is hifil of אָשַׁם: “declare them guilty.” The next clause entrusts the lex talionis to Providence: “let them fall by their own counsels,” exactly the trap motif of Ps 7:16: “בּוֹר כָּרָה וַיַּחְפְּרֵהוּ; וַיִּפֹּל בְּשַׁחַת יִפְעָל” — “He dug a pit and hollowed it out, and fell into the hole he made.” The third line creates a deliberate echo: “בְּרֹב פִּשְׁעֵיהֶם” (“for the abundance of their transgressions”) chimes against v. 8’s “בְּרֹב חַסְדְּךָ” (“through the abundance of Your ḥesed”): abundant sin meets abundant grace, and the outcomes diverge (expulsion versus entry). The rationale is theological, not personal vengeance: “for they have rebelled against You” (מָרוּ בָּךְ), the wilderness verb for defying the divine word (Num 20:24; 27:14). Radak, reading in a Davidic frame, hears a political theology: by resisting the king whom God chose, the wicked rebel against God’s own decree.

**Verse 12**

וְיִשְׂמְחוּ כָּל־חוֹסֵי בָךְ; לְעוֹלָם יְרַנְּנוּ; וְתָסֵךְ עָלֵימוֹ; וְיַעְלְצוּ בְךָ אֹהֲבֵי שְׁמֶךָ.

Three joy-verbs (“rejoice… sing for joy… exult”) match three designations for the faithful: “all who take refuge in You” (חוֹסֵי), those under God’s covering (from סכך: “and You will shelter over them”), and “those who love Your name.” The lexicon of shelter is deeply psalmic: “מַה־יָּקָר חַסְדְּךָ אֱלֹהִים; וּבְנֵי־אָדָם בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ יֶחֱסָיוּן” — “How precious is Your steadfast love, O God! People take refuge in the shadow of Your wings” (Ps 36:8). Here the covering (תָסֵךְ) is a canopy against harm and a liturgical truth: joy endures “forever” because it is located “in You” (בְךָ), not in circumstance. The verse’s appearance in Selichot sharpens the emphasis: penitence is not mere sorrow; it looks forward to durable gladness under God’s protection. The move from “take refuge” to “love Your name” also fills out v. 13’s “צַדִּיק”: the righteous are the ones who run to God and delight in the divine Name.

**Verse 13**

כִּי־אַתָּה תְּבָרֵךְ צַדִּיק, יְהוָה; כַּצִּנָּה רָצוֹן תַּעְטְרֶנּוּ.

The final couplet grounds the whole in divine agency (“for You bless the righteous, O LORD”) and ends with a double-edged metaphor. צִנָּה is the large, full-body shield; עָטַר, as the lexica note, can mean “to crown” (Ps 103:4: “הַמְעַטִּירֵכִי חֶסֶד וְרַחֲמִים” — “who crowns you with steadfast love and compassion”) or “to encircle” (1 Sam 23:26: “וְשָׁאוּל וַאֲנָשָׁיו עֹטְרִים אֶל־דָּוִד” — “Saul and his men were encircling David”). The LXX chooses the honorific (“you will crown”), but Rashi leans to the encircling defense. The Hebrew happily does both: divine favor (רָצוֹן) surrounds and dignifies. Against the psalm’s opening exclusions and middle imprecations, the last word is benediction. The “righteous” here are the refuge-takers and name-lovers of v. 12; their righteousness is not an audit but a relation. The verse’s reuse in liturgy (e.g., in Mizrahi practice around the princes’ offerings) keeps the emphasis where the psalm places it: not on self-congratulation but on the God who both blesses and shields.

Definitions for readers:
- Anaphora: repeating a word or phrase at the beginning of successive lines to create rhythm or emphasis.
- Colon (poetic): a single line within a parallel pair in Hebrew poetry.
- Hifil (verb stem): a Hebrew verb pattern often expressing causation (“cause to X”).
- Hitpael (verb stem): a reflexive or intensive Hebrew pattern (“do X to oneself” or intensified action).

The psalm that began with musing ends with music. Its theology of access—strict holiness, abundant mercy—is not a puzzle to be solved. It is a path to be walked at dawn, arranged with care, and kept under a favor that both crowns and surrounds.
