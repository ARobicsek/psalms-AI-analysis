# Commentary on Psalm 5
---
## Introduction
Psalm 5 is a morning prayer that begins in the half-light. Before words come, there is the inaudible press of thought: “אֲמָרַי הַאֲזִינָה ה׳; בִּינָה הֲגִיגִי” — “Give ear to my words, O LORD; understand my meditation” (v. 2). The noun הֲגִיגִי, from הגה, names a murmur or musing—what the mouth has not yet formed but the heart already feels. Its companion verse in the Psalter makes the point explicit: “דִּבַּרְתִּי בִלְשׁוֹנִי; הוֹדִיעֵנִי ה׳ קִצִּי… חָמַם לִבִּי בְּקִרְבִּי; בַּהֲגִיגִי תִּבְעַר אֵשׁ” — “I spoke with my tongue: ‘LORD, make me know my end’… My heart grew hot within me; while I was musing, fire burned” (Ps 39:4–5). Psalm 5’s opening insists that prayer includes what the self does not yet articulate; God must “consider” it.
The poem is patiently built. Verses 2–4 ask to be heard—“Give ear… Hearken… In the morning You hear my voice”—and then sketch the ritual posture: “בֹּקֶר אֶעֱרׇךְ־לְךָ; וַאֲצַפֶּה” — “At daybreak I will arrange [my prayer] before You; and I will keep watch” (v. 4). The verb עָרַךְ (to arrange) is cultic: the priests “arrange” the wood and offering upon the altar (Lev 1:7–8: “וְעָרַךְ הַכֹּהֵן עֵצִים… וְעָרַךְ הַנֶּתַחִים”). Here, the petitioner orders his prayer as a sacrificial setting-out at dawn, then waits like a sentry. The double “morning” (בֹּקֶר… בֹּקֶר), an instance of anaphora (purposeful repetition at the start of clauses), fixes the hour and instills cadence. Read aloud with the Masoretic accent, the repetition falls with palpable emphasis: “בֹּ֥קֶר תִּשְׁמַ֣ע… בֹּ֥קֶר אֶעֱרׇךְ־לְךָ” — the morning is not a clock-time but a liturgical gate.
Then comes theology in a series of exclusions. “For You are not a God who desires wickedness; evil does not sojourn with You” (v. 5). The verb גור (“to sojourn”) is the verb of the resident alien and, in the Psalms, of temple access: “ה׳, מִי־יָגוּר בְּאָהֳלֶךָ? מִי־יִשְׁכֹּן בְּהַר קׇדְשֶׁךָ?” — “LORD, who may sojourn in Your tent? Who may dwell on Your holy mountain?” (Ps 15:1). Psalm 5 presses the point: God’s presence is uninhabitable to evil. The next line extends the image from dwelling to courtly standing: “לֹא־יִתְיַצְּבוּ הוֹלְלִים לְנֶגֶד עֵינֶיךָ; שָׂנֵאתָ כׇּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן” — “The boastful cannot take their stand before Your eyes; You hate all evildoers” (v. 6). To “stand before” is the posture of servants admitted to a king. The poem is not coy about God’s affect: hatred and abhorrence fall upon “speakers of lies,” upon “the man of blood and deceit” (v. 7). Rabbinic tradition crystallized this ethical emphasis: “Four classes do not receive the Divine Presence—scoffers, flatterers, liars, and slanderers” (Berakhot 6b), a catalogue that maps closely onto Psalm 5’s speech sins.
If the psalm ended here, worship would collapse into moralism. It does not. Instead, a hinge opens with a single turn of phrase: “וַאֲנִי בְּרֹב חַסְדְּךָ אָבוֹא בֵיתֶךָ” — “But I, through the abundance of Your steadfast love, shall enter Your house” (v. 8). The preposition בְּ (“by means of”) makes the claim stark: access is by grace, not self-congratulation. The line answers the entrance question of Psalm 15 with a different register. There, the entry conditions are ethical: “He who walks blamelessly and does justice…” (Ps 15:2). Here, the poet’s entry is “through the abundance of Your ḥesed,” God’s covenant loyalty. That is not a contradiction; it is a dialectic. The house that excludes wickedness opens to the petitioner not as a reward for blamelessness but as a gift—received “בְּיִרְאָתֶךָ,” “in awe,” for grace does not cancel reverence.
The psalm’s anatomy of evil is linguistic. Enemies are defined not first as violent but as duplicitous: “There is no steadfastness in their mouth… their throat is an open grave; they make their tongue smooth” (v. 10). The image is precise and disturbing. Jeremiah speaks the figure in another key: “אַשְׁפָּתוֹ כְּקֶבֶר פָּתוּחַ” — “His quiver is like an open grave” (Jer 5:16), an image of deadly intent. The Psalter knows the smooth tongue well: “חָלְקוּ מַחְמָאוֹת פִּיו… רַכּוּ דְבָרָיו מִשֶּׁמֶן” — “Smoother than butter were his words… his words were softer than oil” (Ps 55:22); “שְׂפַת חֲלָקוֹת” — “a slippery/smooth lip” (Ps 12:3). In Psalm 5 the metaphor becomes anatomical: from mouth (פֶּה) to inner parts (קֶרֶב) to throat (גָּרוֹן) to tongue (לָשׁוֹן). It is not just what they say; something in the organ of speech itself has become a devouring opening.
After the hinge of grace (v. 8) and the anatomy of duplicity (v. 10), the psalm turns to prayer for guidance: “ה׳, נְחֵנִי בְצִדְקָתֶךָ… הַיְשַׁר לְפָנַי דַּרְכֶּךָ” — “O LORD, lead me in Your righteousness… make Your way straight before me” (v. 9). The verb נחה (to lead) evokes shepherding; the request is moral and practical. Two verses later, the psalm returns to abundance, this time on the other side: “בְּרֹב פִּשְׁעֵיהֶם הַדִּיחֵמוֹ” — “for the abundance of their transgressions, thrust them out” (v. 11). Read with v. 8 (“through the abundance of Your ḥesed”), the pair sketches an ethical antiphony: abundant grace grants access; abundant transgression compels expulsion. The balance is not exact (grace is not earned), but the parallelism is deliberate and memorable.
The poem ends where it began—in the grammar of refuge—but with the mood transposed to joy: “וְיִשְׂמְחוּ כָּל־חוֹסֵי בָךְ… וְיַעְלְצוּ בְךָ אֹהֲבֵי שְׁמֶךָ” — “Let all who take refuge in You rejoice… let those who love Your name exult in You” (v. 12). To “take refuge” (חסה) is a stock verb for trust in the Psalms (e.g., Ps 36:8: “בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ יֶחֱסָיוּן” — “In the shadow of Your wings they take refuge”); it describes orientation, not moral bookkeeping. The final metaphor is martial and tender at once: “כַּצִּנָּה רָצוֹן תַּעְטְרֶנּוּ” — “With favor, like a large shield, You encompass him” (v. 13). צִנָּה is the full-body shield; עָטַר can mean both “to crown” and “to encircle.” God’s favor is both honor and surrounding defense. The Greek translators leaned into the honorific (“you will crown”), but the Hebrew holds both senses. Either way, the righteous here are finally not those who brag about their record; they are “those who take refuge,” “those who love Your name,” and, by the last line, “צַדִּיק,” a term now filled by trust and orientation as much as by deed.
Even the superscription is a small puzzle and a reminder of lost performance practice: “לַמְנַצֵּחַ אֶל־הַנְּחִילוֹת” — “For the choirmaster; on the neḥiloth” (v. 1). The LXX takes a wild swing (“concerning the one who inherits”), perhaps connecting it to נַחֲלָה (inheritance). Medievals split: Rav Hai Gaon and Radak linked נְחִילוֹת to a “swarm” (נְחִיל) of bees; Rashi and Ibn Ezra took it as a musical label. Modern lexica cautiously suggest flutes (חָלִיל) or a melody. The truth is, we no longer know. What we do know is what the rest of the line makes plain: this is song for the sanctuary—ordered, sung, and entrusted to a leader.
The paradox that holds the poem together is not a system but a posture: God’s presence is morally incandescent (“evil cannot sojourn”), and yet the petitioner’s entry is by grace alone (“through the abundance of Your ḥesed”). The worshiper “arranges” prayer as an offering at dawn and stands waiting. He asks to be led on a straight road while enemies sharpen their tongues. He flees into God’s shelter and finds the covering, in the end, is favor itself.
## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use
#### Key verses
וַאֲנִי בְּרֹב חַסְדְּךָ אָבוֹא בֵיתֶךָ; אֶשְׁתַּחֲוֶה אֶל־הֵיכַל־קׇדְשְׁךָ בְּיִרְאָתֶךָ (Ps 5:8). “But I, through the abundance of Your mercy, shall enter Your house; I shall bow toward Your holy temple in awe of You.” This verse anchors Ma Tovu, recited when entering synagogue. The prayer quotes the verse verbatim: “וַאֲנִי בְּרֹב חַסְדְּךָ אָבוֹא בֵיתֶךָ; אֶשְׁתַּחֲוֶה אֶל הֵיכַל קָדְשְׁךָ בְּיִרְאָתֶךָ.” English: “As for me, through Your abundant mercy I enter Your house; I bow toward Your holy temple in awe.” The liturgy thus makes the psalm’s theology of access an entrance rite for daily prayer.
הַקְשִׁיבָה לְקוֹל שַׁוְעִי, מַלְכִּי וֵאלֹקָי; כִּי־אֵלֶיךָ אֶתְפַּלָּל (Ps 5:3). “Hearken to the voice of my cry, my King and my God; for to You I pray.” In Eastern rites (Edot HaMizrach), this appears in the Mincha preparatory block before the Amidah, immediately after Ps 141:2: “תִּכּוֹן תְּפִלָּתִי קְטֹרֶת לְפָנֶיךָ… הַקְשִׁיבָה לְקוֹל שַׁוְעִי מַלְכִּי וֵאלֹקָי כִּי־אֵלֶיךָ אֶתְפַּלָּל.” English: “May my prayer be set before You as incense… Give heed to the voice of my cry, my King and my God, for to You I pray.” It functions as the threshold invocation to the central prayer.
ה׳, בֹּקֶר תִּשְׁמַע קוֹלִי; בֹּקֶר אֶעֱרָךְ־לְךָ, וַאֲצַפֶּה (Ps 5:4). “LORD, at daybreak You hear my voice; at daybreak I arrange [my prayer] for You and watch.” In Sefard usage, this line is the people’s response within Birkat Kohanim: “ה׳ בֹּקֶר תִּשְׁמַע קוֹלִי; בֹּקֶר אֶעֱרָךְ־לְךָ וַאֲצַפֶּה.” English: “LORD, in the morning hear my voice; in the morning I set it before You and wait.” The community answers the priestly blessing by renewing the dawn vigil.
ה׳, נְחֵנִי בְצִדְקָתֶךָ לְמַעַן שׁוֹרְרָי; הַיְשַׁר לְפָנַי דַּרְכֶּךָ (Ps 5:9). “O LORD, lead me in Your righteousness because of my watchers; make Your way straight before me.” Commonly recited when leaving synagogue in Sefard nusach: “כְּשֶׁיוֹצֵא מִבֵּית הַכְּנֶסֶת אוֹמֵר: ה׳ נְחֵנִי בְצִדְקָתֶךָ… הַיְשַׁר לְפָנַי דַּרְכֶּךָ.” English: “Lead me in Your righteousness… make Your way straight before me.” The verse becomes a benediction for re-entering ordinary life.
#### Phrases
אֲמָרַי הַאֲזִינָה ה׳; בִּינָה הֲגִיגִי (Ps 5:2). “Give ear to my words, O LORD; understand my meditation.” Selichot often weave it into confessional entreaties: “אֲמָרֵינוּ הַאֲזִינָה ה׳; בִּינָה הֲגִיגֵנוּ… יִהְיוּ לְרָצוֹן אִמְרֵי פִינוּ וְהֶגְיוֹן לִבֵּנוּ” — “Give ear to our words, O LORD; consider our meditation… Let the words of our mouth and the meditation of our heart be acceptable.”
הַקְשִׁיבָה לְקוֹל (Ps 5:3). “Give heed to the voice…” Appears repeatedly in penitential poetry, e.g., High Holiday Selichot: “הַקְשִׁיבָה לְקוֹל תַּחֲנוּנֵינוּ; הַקְשִׁיבָה לְקוֹל שַׁוְעָתֵנוּ, מַלְכֵּנוּ וֵאלֹקֵינוּ.” English: “Give heed to the voice of our supplications; give heed to the voice of our cry, our King and our God.”
The liturgy consistently reads the psalm “with the grain”: morning as the hour of ordered prayer; entry into God’s house as a mercy; and the straight path as a gift asked for and received.

## Verse-by-Verse Commentary
**Verse 1**
לַמְנַצֵּחַ אֶל־הַנְּחִילֹות; מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד.
The superscription gives us a setting and a riddle. לַמְנַצֵּחַ (“for the leader/choirmaster”) marks this as public performance under professional direction; מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד places it in the Davidic collection. אֶל־הַנְּחִילוֹת is the riddle. The Greek translators took a stray path—“concerning the one who inherits”—as if from נַחֲלָה (inheritance), an unlikely fit. Medieval Jews offered two plausible tracks: a musical term (Rashi; Ibn Ezra) or a sound-image (Rav Hai Gaon; Radak) from נְחִיל דְּבוֹרִים, a “swarm of bees,” evoking a rapid, buzzing texture. Modern lexicography leaves it unresolved, tentatively linking it to flutes (חָלִיל). What matters for reading is the first word: the psalm is not a private murmur; it is liturgical speech. That orientation colors the early verbs (v. 4’s “I will arrange [my prayer] before You”) and the closing wish for communal joy (v. 12). It is also worth noticing the superscriptions’ realism: they often preserve performance notes whose meanings we have lost. The paradox of the psalter is here compressed—a sung prayer that belongs to the assembly, and yet one voice, “I,” for whom the first business of the day is to be heard.
**Verse 2**
אֲמָרַי הַאֲזִינָה ה׳; בִּינָה הֲגִיגִי.
The parallel cola move from words to what precedes words. “אֲמָרַי הַאֲזִינָה” asks YHWH to “give ear” (from אוזן) to spoken utterances; “בִּינָה הֲגִיגִי” asks Him to “understand” (imperative of בין) the inner murmur. הֲגִיג (from הגה) appears again in Ps 39:4: “בַּהֲגִיגִי תִּבְעַר אֵשׁ” — “While I was musing, a fire burned.” The Psalmist’s realism is pastoral: much of what we need to pray resists articulation; God must interpret it. The verbs are nicely chosen. “Give ear” is bodily—a God bending toward whispering speech. “Understand” is cognitive—God must do the hermeneutic work. Traditional commentators already heard this progression. Radak: “מַה שֶׁאוֹצִיא בְּפִי הַאֲזִינָה, וּמַה שֶׁאֶהְגֶּה בְּלִבִּי בִּינָה” — “What I utter with my mouth—give ear; what I meditate in my heart—understand.” The line invites the reader to think of prayer not as a performance delivered to a passive deity but as a collaboration in which the petitioner orders his words and God attends to the stirrings that exceed them. It is no accident that penitential liturgy borrows this language for communal confession: “אֲמָרֵינוּ הַאֲזִינָה… בִּינָה הֲגִיגֵנוּ” — “Give ear to our words… consider our meditation.” The psalm’s opening looses a generous doctrine: that prayer’s most honest part may be the part that never leaves the chest.
**Verse 3**
הַקְשִׁיבָה לְקוֹל שַׁוְעִי; מַלְכִּי וֵאלֹקָי; כִּי־אֵלֶיךָ אֶתְפַּלָּל.
A second hearing-verb, הַקְשִׁיבָה (“give heed”), raises the intensity: not only words, not only meditation, but “the voice of my cry” (שַׁוְעִי). The cry שַׁוְעָה connotes emergency. What makes this plea intimate is the double title: “מַלְכִּי וֵאלֹקָי” — “my King and my God.” The phrase also appears in Ps 84:4 (Eng. 84:3): “גַּם־צִפּוֹר מָצְאָה בַיִת… ה׳ צְבָקוֹת מַלְכִּי וֵאלֹקָי” — “Even the bird has found a home… LORD of Hosts, my King and my God.” Here, covenantal sovereignty (“my King”) and personal deity (“my God”) fuse. The final clause states the exclusivity of address: “for to You I pray” (hitpael of פלל, an intensive/reflexive form). Ibn Ezra hears this as an avowal of loyalty: there is no other addressee, no other court. In Eastern liturgy, the verse serves as a preface to the Amidah—fittingly, for the Amidah is both petition and enthronement. The structure of the three opening verses is worth noting as a small example of poetic “staircase” parallelism (a form in which each colon builds on the previous). “Give ear… understand… give heed to the voice of my cry”: a carefully stepped intensification.
**Verse 4**
ה׳, בֹּקֶר תִּשְׁמַע קוֹלִי; בֹּקֶר אֶעֱרָךְ־לְךָ; וַאֲצַפֶּה.
The morning anaphora (repetition) — “בֹּקֶר… בֹּקֶר” — sets the hour and, with it, the posture. First, “You hear my voice” at dawn; then, “I arrange [my prayer]” (אֶעֱרָךְ) like a priest lays out a sacrifice (Lev 1:7–8); finally, “I watch” (וַאֲצַפֶּה), from צפה, to keep a lookout. The sequence gives the movement of worship: God’s attention → my careful preparation → my expectant waiting. Two biblical resonances amplify the cultic shading: “תִּכּוֹן תְּפִלָּתִי קְטֹרֶת לְפָנֶיךָ” — “Let my prayer be set like incense before You” (Ps 141:2), and the prophetic watch-post: “עַל־מִשְׁמַרְתִּי אֶעֱמֹדָה… וַאֲצַפֶּה” — “I will stand at my watch… and I will watch” (Hab 2:1). Chanted, the line bears its own cadence: the stressed beats in the Masoretic accent land on “בֹּ֥קֶר” and “וַאֲצַפֶּֽה,” giving the day its pulse. Theological cautions hide in the grammar: prayer is not merely outpouring; it must be ordered; and piety’s last move is not frenetic action but watchful patience.
**Verse 5**
כִּי לֹא קֵל־חָפֵץ רֶשַׁע אַתָּה; לֹא יְגֻרְךָ רָע.
A compressed creed. God does not “desire” (חָפֵץ) wickedness; evil cannot “sojourn” (גור) with Him. The second verb is programmatic. גור is the verb of the ger (resident alien), and the Psalms harness it to the question of temple approach: “ה׳, מִי־יָגוּר בְּאָהֳלֶךָ?” (Ps 15:1). Psalm 5 gives the ontological answer: evil, as such, cannot reside in that presence. Malbim (19th c.) pressed the contrast with pagan myth: Israel’s God is not a composite of capricious forces that include malign appetites; holiness is not a slice of cosmic chaos; the God of Israel is morally intelligent. Radak makes it personal: if God finds no pleasure in wickedness, then He will not delight in those enemies (the psalmist’s own) whose behaviors are named in the next couplets. The verse also begins a pattern of negatives (“לֹא… לֹא”) that builds a strong rhetorical fence—evil is excluded from divine intimacy in both dwelling and delight.
**Verse 6**
לֹא־יִתְיַצְּבוּ הוֹלְלִים לְנֶגֶד עֵינֶיךָ; שָׂנֵאתָ כָּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן.
The imagery turns courtly. “They cannot take their stand (יִתְיַצְּבוּ) before Your eyes”: the verb (hitpael of יצב) is the posture of courtiers. The eyes (“before Your eyes”) are the royal gaze. הוֹלְלִים can be “boasters” (distinct from the praise-verb הִלֵּל) or “insolent fools.” Either way, they are barred. The emotional register tightens: “You hate all workers of iniquity.” The noun phrase פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן (“workers of wrongdoing”) is a psalmic stock; the force lies in the universal “all.” The psalms elsewhere echo the same courtroom vocabulary for enemies: “לֹא־יִתְיַצֵּב אִישׁ בִּפְנֵיכֶם” — “No one shall stand up before you” (Deut 11:25). Here, the King’s aversion is the definitive exclusion. Readers who stumble over the word “hate” should hear it as covenantal antipathy: a moral God takes sides against what destroys the human face.
**Verse 7**
תְּאַבֵּד דֹּבְרֵי כָזָב; אִישׁ דָּמִים וּמִרְמָה יְתַעֵב ה׳.
The catalogue sharpens: liars and a “man of blood and deceit.” The pairing is not accidental. Psalm 55 closes with the same duo: “אַנְשֵׁי דָמִים וּמִרְמָה לֹא־יֶחֱצוּ יְמֵיהֶם” — “Men of blood and deceit shall not live out half their days” (Ps 55:24). Jeremiah’s line about the tongue completes the triangle: “חֵץ שָׁחוּט לְשׁוֹנָם; מִרְמָה דִּבֵּר” — “Their tongue is a sharpened arrow; it speaks deceit” (Jer 9:7). The psalmist’s moral imagination equates weaponized language and bloodshed. The verbs escalate: “You destroy” (תְּאַבֵּד), “the LORD abhors” (יְתַעֵב). Torah Temimah folds verses like these into a rabbinic principle: certain habits of speech—scoffing, flattery, lying, slander—disqualify a person from encountering the Shekhinah (Berakhot 6b). It is difficult to overstate how consistently the Psalms teach that social speech is a spiritual barometer.
**Verse 8**
וַאֲנִי בְּרֹב חַסְדְּךָ אָבוֹא בֵיתֶךָ; אֶשְׁתַּחֲוֶה אֶל־הֵיכַל־קׇדְשְׁךָ בְּיִרְאָתֶךָ.
This is the hinge. “But I”—the adversative וַאֲנִי is the turn from exclusion to access—“through the abundance of Your ḥesed, shall enter Your house.” The instrumental בְּ (“by means of”) says what needs to be said: the worshiper’s entry is grace-based. Two verbs describe the arc of worship: “I enter” the precinct; “I bow” toward the inner sanctuary. בְּיִרְאָתֶךָ adds the affect—“in awe.” In Jewish practice, this verse plants itself at the synagogue door in Ma Tovu, the threshold prayer: we do not claim entry by consistency of virtue but by the abundance of covenant mercy. The line sits consciously beside the entrance catechisms of Psalms 15 and 24. Psalm 15 answers “Who may sojourn?” with a moral profile; Psalm 5 says, “As for me, I enter by Your ḥesed.” The difference is not contradiction but stereophony: righteousness matters; grace ushers.
**Verse 9**
ה׳, נְחֵנִי בְצִדְקָתֶךָ לְמַעַן שׁוֹרְרָי; הַיְשַׁר לְפָנַי דַּרְכֶּךָ.
The prayer now asks to be formed, not merely protected. “Lead me” (נחה) “in Your righteousness,” and “make straight” Your way before me. The “watchers” (שׁוֹרְרַי) are hostile onlookers who lie in wait to gloat at a slip. The pairing of guidance and straightness recalls Ps 27:11: “הוֹרֵנִי ה׳ דַּרְכֶּךָ; וּנְחֵנִי בְּאֹרַח מִישֹׁור” — “Teach me Your way, O LORD; and lead me on a level path.” The Qere of our line (הַיְשַׁר) is an imperative of the hiphil (“make straight”). The metaphors are spatial because the moral life is a kind of walking. In Sefard usage, the verse accompanies congregants as they step back into weekday life after prayer: “ה׳ נְחֵנִי בְצִדְקָתֶךָ… הַיְשַׁר לְפָנַי דַּרְכֶּךָ.” The liturgy thus turns the psalm’s moral geography into a daily request.
**Verse 10**
כִּי אֵין בְּפִיהוּ נְכוֹנָה; קִרְבָּם הַוּוֹת; קֶבֶר־פָּתוּחַ גְּרוֹנָם; לְשׁוֹנָם יַחֲלִיקוּן.
An autopsy of duplicity. The mouth (פֶּה) has no “steadfastness” (נְכוֹנָה; from כון, “firmness”); the inner parts (קֶרֶב) are “destructions” (הַוּוֹת); the throat (גָּרוֹן) is “an open grave”; and the tongue (לָשׁוֹן) they “make smooth.” Two parallel texts illuminate the imagery. Jeremiah’s “quiver like an open grave” (Jer 5:16) links instruments of death and the hungry mouth of burial—ominous appetite disguised as speech. Psalm 55:22: “חָלְקוּ מַחְמָאוֹת פִּיו… רַכּוּ דְבָרָיו מִשֶּׁמֶן וְהֵמָּה פְתִחוֹת” — “Smoother than butter were his words… softer than oil were his words, yet they are drawn swords.” Psalm 12:3 heightens: “דַּבֵּר שָׁוְא אִישׁ אֶת־רֵעֵהוּ; שְׂפַת חֲלָקוֹת, בְּלֵב וָלֵב” — “Everyone speaks falsehood with his neighbor; with smooth lip, with a double heart.” Our psalm compresses all three: seduction (“smooth”), duplicity (“double-hearted”), and the devouring void (“open grave”). The somatic progression (mouth → inner parts → throat → tongue) maps motive into mechanism into output. Radak sees a moral trap: those who are not on guard “when they smooth their tongue… will fall into their grave,” i.e., into the designs of their heart.
**Verse 11**
הַאֲשִׁימֵם אֱלֹקִים; יִפְּלוּ מִמֹּעֲצוֹתֵיהֶם; בְּרֹב פִּשְׁעֵיהֶם הַדִּיחֵמוֹ; כִּי־מָרוּ בָּךְ.
Imprecation is ethically hard; Psalm 5 makes it judicial. The first verb (הַאֲשִׁימֵם) is hifil of אָשַׁם: “declare them guilty.” The next clause entrusts the lex talionis to Providence: “let them fall by their own counsels,” exactly the trap motif of Ps 7:16: “בּוֹר כָּרָה וַיַּחְפְּרֵהוּ; וַיִּפֹּל בְּשַׁחַת יִפְעָל” — “He dug a pit and hollowed it out, and fell into the hole he made.” The third line creates a deliberate echo: “בְּרֹב פִּשְׁעֵיהֶם” (“for the abundance of their transgressions”) chimes against v. 8’s “בְּרֹב חַסְדְּךָ” (“through the abundance of Your ḥesed”): abundant sin meets abundant grace, and the outcomes diverge (expulsion versus entry). The rationale is theological, not personal vengeance: “for they have rebelled against You” (מָרוּ בָּךְ), the wilderness verb for defying the divine word (Num 20:24; 27:14). Radak, reading in a Davidic frame, hears a political theology: by resisting the king whom God chose, the wicked rebel against God’s own decree.
**Verse 12**
וְיִשְׂמְחוּ כָּל־חוֹסֵי בָךְ; לְעוֹלָם יְרַנְּנוּ; וְתָסֵךְ עָלֵימוֹ; וְיַעְלְצוּ בְךָ אֹהֲבֵי שְׁמֶךָ.
Three joy-verbs (“rejoice… sing for joy… exult”) match three designations for the faithful: “all who take refuge in You” (חוֹסֵי), those under God’s covering (from סכך: “and You will shelter over them”), and “those who love Your name.” The lexicon of shelter is deeply psalmic: “מַה־יָּקָר חַסְדְּךָ אֱלֹקִים; וּבְנֵי־אָדָם בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ יֶחֱסָיוּן” — “How precious is Your steadfast love, O God! People take refuge in the shadow of Your wings” (Ps 36:8). Here the covering (תָסֵךְ) is a canopy against harm and a liturgical truth: joy endures “forever” because it is located “in You” (בְךָ), not in circumstance. The verse’s appearance in Selichot sharpens the emphasis: penitence is not mere sorrow; it looks forward to durable gladness under God’s protection. The move from “take refuge” to “love Your name” also fills out v. 13’s “צַדִּיק”: the righteous are the ones who run to God and delight in the divine Name.
**Verse 13**
כִּי־אַתָּה תְּבָרֵךְ צַדִּיק, ה׳; כַּצִּנָּה רָצוֹן תַּעְטְרֶנּוּ.
The final couplet grounds the whole in divine agency (“for You bless the righteous, O LORD”) and ends with a double-edged metaphor. צִנָּה is the large, full-body shield; עָטַר, as the lexica note, can mean “to crown” (Ps 103:4: “הַמְעַטִּירֵכִי חֶסֶד וְרַחֲמִים” — “who crowns you with steadfast love and compassion”) or “to encircle” (1 Sam 23:26: “וְשָׁאוּל וַאֲנָשָׁיו עֹטְרִים אֶל־דָּוִד” — “Saul and his men were encircling David”). The LXX chooses the honorific (“you will crown”), but Rashi leans to the encircling defense. The Hebrew happily does both: divine favor (רָצוֹן) surrounds and dignifies. Against the psalm’s opening exclusions and middle imprecations, the last word is benediction. The “righteous” here are the refuge-takers and name-lovers of v. 12; their righteousness is not an audit but a relation. The verse’s reuse in liturgy (e.g., in Mizrahi practice around the princes’ offerings) keeps the emphasis where the psalm places it: not on self-congratulation but on the God who both blesses and shields.
Definitions for readers:
- Anaphora: repeating a word or phrase at the beginning of successive lines to create rhythm or emphasis.
- Colon (poetic): a single line within a parallel pair in Hebrew poetry.
- Hifil (verb stem): a Hebrew verb pattern often expressing causation (“cause to X”).
- Hitpael (verb stem): a reflexive or intensive Hebrew pattern (“do X to oneself” or intensified action).
The psalm that began with musing ends with music. Its theology of access—strict holiness, abundant mercy—is not a puzzle to be solved. It is a path to be walked at dawn, arranged with care, and kept under a favor that both crowns and surrounds.
