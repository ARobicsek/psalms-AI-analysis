## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (11)

1. What is the meaning and significance of 'neḥiloth' in the superscription (v. 1), and how do ancient versions translate it? Does it refer to musical instrumentation (flutes?), melody type, or something else?
2. How does 'hagigi' (my utterance/meditation, v. 2) function lexically and theologically? Where else does this term appear in Psalms, and what does it reveal about the nature of prayer as interior reflection versus external speech?
3. What are the cultic/sacrificial connotations of 'a'erok lekha' (I arrange before You, v. 4)? Does this verb elsewhere describe laying out sacrifices, and if so, how does this inform understanding prayer as spiritual sacrifice?
4. The phrase 'lo yegurka ra' (evil cannot sojourn/abide with You, v. 5)—how does the verb 'gur' (to sojourn) relate to temple residence theology and who can 'dwell' with God? Compare with Psalm 15:1's 'who may sojourn in Your tent?'
5. How does the body-part imagery in v. 10 (mouth, heart, throat, tongue) function syntactically and semantically? Is there a progression from interior to exterior, and how does this compare to similar imagery in Proverbs or prophetic literature?
6. The 'open grave' (qever patuach) metaphor for throat in v. 10—is this a unique image or part of broader Ancient Near Eastern death/speech associations? How does Paul's use in Romans 3:13 interpret this image?
7. What is the theological function of 'chesed' (covenant love/lovingkindness) in v. 8 as the sole basis for temple access? How does this grace theology relate to or tension with the entrance liturgies of Psalms 15 and 24 that emphasize moral requirements?
8. The verbs in v. 11's imprecation (ha'ashimem, yippelu, hadikhem)—what are their precise meanings and grammatical forms? Are these imperative requests, jussive wishes, or prophetic predictions? How does this affect the ethics of imprecatory prayer?
9. How does the 'tzinnah' (shield) imagery in v. 13 compare with other protective metaphors in Psalms? What specific type of shield is this, and how does 'ratzon' (favor) function as shielding substance?
10. What is the relationship between 'chosim' (those who take refuge, v. 12), 'ohavei shemekha' (those who love Your name, v. 12), and 'tzaddiq' (righteous, v. 13)? Are these synonymous designations or distinct groups, and how does 'refuge' language define righteousness?
11. How do the morning/dawn references (boqer, v. 4) connect to other dawn prayers in Psalms and to ancient Near Eastern prayer practices? Is there theological significance to morning prayer beyond liturgical convention?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (10)

1. What is the meaning of 'נְחִילוֹת' in the superscription, and why does the LXX interpret it as 'inheritance' rather than a musical term?
2. Does 'הֲגִיגִי' (my utterance/meditation) in v.2 specifically denote interior reflection as distinct from exterior speech, and how does this relate to wisdom meditation vocabulary?
3. What are the cultic/sacrificial connotations of 'אֶעֱרׇךְ־לְךָ' (I arrange before You) in v.4 - does this explicitly compare prayer to sacrifice?
4. Why does v.5 use 'יְגֻרְךָ' (sojourn) for evil's inability to abide with God - is this technical entrance liturgy language parallel to Psalm 15:1?
5. Is the progression in v.10's body imagery (mouth→inward parts→throat→tongue) intentional, moving from exterior to interior and back, or simply accumulated metaphor?
6. How does the 'open grave' metaphor for throat in v.10 function in Ancient Near Eastern death/speech associations, and why did Paul choose this verse for Romans 3:13?
7. What is the theological relationship between 'בְּרֹב חַסְדְּךָ' (v.8) and 'בְּרֹב פִּשְׁעֵיהֶם' (v.11) - is the parallel intentional to contrast grace and sin?
8. Are the verbs in v.11's imprecation (הַאֲשִׁימֵם, יִפְּלוּ, הַדִּיחֵמוֹ) true imperatives commanding God, or jussives expressing wishes?
9. Does 'תַּעְטְרֶנּוּ' in v.13 mean 'crown' (suggesting honor) or 'encompass' (suggesting protection), and why does LXX choose 'crown'?
10. How do the three designations for the righteous in vv.12-13 relate: 'חוֹסֵי בָךְ' (refuge-takers), 'אֹהֲבֵי שְׁמֶֽךָ' (name-lovers), and 'צַדִּיק' (righteous) - are these synonymous or progressive?
