**Verse 1**

לַמְנַצֵּחַ מִזְמֹר לְדָוִד׃  

The superscription is as terse as Hebrew can make it: “For the director; a psalm of David.” Yet it does important work.

לַמְנַצֵּחַ, usually rendered “for the leader” or “choirmaster,” comes from a root (נ־צ־ח) that in later Hebrew can mean “to conquer” but in biblical prose often means “to oversee.” Chronicles uses it for the Levites appointed “לְנַצֵּחַ עַל־הַנְּגִינוֹת”—“to direct with harps” (1 Chronicles 15:21). The BDB lexicon suggests that the psalm headings with לַמְנַצֵּחַ may mark pieces drawn from an older anthology used by the temple’s musical director. In any case, this little word lifts Psalm 13 out of the purely private. What we overhear is not only an individual’s agony; it is agony selected, polished, and handed to the community to sing.

מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד, “a psalm of David,” does double duty. Historically-minded readers may picture episodes in David’s life: hunted by Saul, betrayed by allies, on the run from his son Absalom. Traditional commentators also use the Davidic label typologically. Radak writes: “זה המזמור אמרו דוד בעת שהיה בצרה מאויביו או נאמר על לשון הגלות; והוא הנכון”—David said it when he was in trouble from his enemies, *or* it is said in the voice of the exile, “and this is correct.” The king’s “I” can be inhabited by the whole people.

The formula “לַמְנַצֵּחַ מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד” also links Psalm 13 to others with the same heading, especially Psalms 4 and 21. Psalm 4 opens: “לַמְנַצֵּחַ בִּנְגִינוֹת מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד,” and moves, like Psalm 13, from distress to confidence and peaceful sleep: “בְּשָׁלוֹם יַחְדָּו אֶשְׁכְּבָה וְאִישָׁן… לָבֶטַח תּוֹשִׁיבֵנִי”—“In peace, all together, I will lie down and sleep… You alone, O LORD, make me dwell secure” (Psalm 4:9). Psalm 21, another “לַמְנַצֵּחַ מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד,” celebrates the king who “בֹּטֵחַ בַּיהוָה… בְּחֶסֶד עֶלְיוֹן בַּל־יִמּוֹט”—“trusts in the LORD; through the steadfast love of the Most High he will not be shaken” (21:8). Psalm 13 could be heard as the dark corridor between those two: the night before Psalm 21’s royal assurance, the waking anguish behind Psalm 4’s peaceful sleep.

Liturgically, “לַמְנַצֵּחַ מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד” has become almost invisible to many modern worshippers, skipped as a mere label. But in antiquity it was a performance direction: hand this to the director; teach the choir to sing these words. That already suggests something about Israel’s spiritual pedagogy: even the feeling that God has “forgotten me forever” belongs on the public stage.

**Verse 2**

עַד־אָ֣נָה יְהוָה תִּשְׁכָּחֵנִי נֶצַח;  
עַד־אָ֓נָה ׀ תַּסְתִּיר אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ מִמֶּנִּי׃  

The psalmist does not ease into his complaint. Twice in quick succession he cries “עַד־אָנָה”—“How long?” The phrase begins with a short, guttural burst and lands on the drawn-out syllable אָנָה, so that read aloud—ʿadh‑’Ā‑nāh—it hammers the ear. The repetition is not redundant. It enacts duration: “How long? How long?”

The first question charges God with forgetting: “תִּשְׁכָּחֵנִי נֶצַח”—“Will You forget me forever?” The verb שָׁכַח, “forget,” is the dark twin of זָכַר, “remember.” In the Bible, God’s “remembering” often marks a turning point: “וַיִּזְכֹּר אֱלֹהִים אֶת־נֹחַ”—“God remembered Noah” (Genesis 8:1); “וַיִּזְכֹּר אֱלֹהִים אֶת־בְּרִיתוֹ”—“God remembered His covenant” (Exodus 2:24). Here the psalmist dares the inverse: You, whose memory is supposed to be the guarantee of my survival, seem to have mislaid me.

נֶצַח can mean “forever,” but BDB notes it may also mean “for a long time.” Either way, the speaker’s experience turns delay into what feels like permanence. The question is rhetorical—not a request for information but a protest: if this goes on much longer, it might as well be forever.

The second colon moves from cognition to presence: “תַּסְתִּיר אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ מִמֶּנִּי”—“Will You hide Your face from me?” In biblical idiom, God’s “face” stands for His manifest presence and favor. The priestly blessing in Numbers 6:25 prays, “יָאֵר יְהוָה פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ”—“May the LORD make His face shine upon you.” Its opposite is covenant judgment. Deuteronomy 31:17–18 records God’s warning:

> “וְחָרָה אַפִּי בּוֹ בַּיּוֹם הַהוּא…  
> וְהִסְתַּרְתִּי פָנַי מֵהֶם…  
> וְאָנֹכִי הַסְתֵּר אַסְתִּיר פָּנַי בַּיּוֹם הַהוּא.”  
> “My anger shall blaze against them… I will hide My face from them… I will surely hide My face on that day.”

Similarly, Psalm 88:15 laments: “לָמָה יְהוָה תִּזְנַח נַפְשִׁי, תַּסְתִּיר פָּנֶיךָ מִמֶּנִּי”—“Why, O LORD, do You reject me, do You hide Your face from me?” In those contexts, hiddenness is deserved punishment for idolatry or sin.

Psalm 13 is striking because it borrows the same imagery without a confession. The psalmist does not say, “I have forsaken You”; he says, in effect, “You have forsaken me, and I do not know why.” That gap between Deuteronomy’s neat moral calculus and this raw experience is where much of post‑biblical Jewish theology lives.

The double “How long?” also echoes other psalms of protest. Psalm 79:5 cries, “עַד־מָתַי יְהוָה תֶּאֱנַף לָנֶצַח?”—“How long, O LORD, will You be angry forever?” Psalm 62:4 transposes the phrase horizontally: “עַד־אָנָה תְּהוֹתְתוּ עַל־אִישׁ”—“How long will you batter a man?” In Psalm 13, both vectors converge: God seems absent above; enemies press in below.

**Verse 3**

עַד־אָ֨נָה אָשִׁ֪ית עֵצוֹת בְּנַפְשִׁי;  
יָגוֹן בִּלְבָבִי יוֹמָם;  
עַד־אָ֓נָה ׀ יָרוּם אֹיְבִי עָלָי׃  

The second pair of “How long?” questions traces the damage from inside to outside.

First, the mind: “עַד־אָ֨נָה אָשִׁ֪ית עֵצוֹת בְּנַפְשִׁי”—“How long shall I place עֵצוֹת in my life?” עֵצוֹת is the plural of עֵצָה, “counsel.” BDB lists its senses as “advice,” “plan,” even “design.” The picture is of someone continually laying out plans or strategies in his own *nephesh*—his inner life—to cope with disaster. Ibn Ezra reads it exactly this way: “אחשוב ואשית עצות בנפשי”—“I think and lay plans in my soul.”

At the same time, the parallel colon reads not like cold strategy but like rumination: “יָגוֹן בִּלְבָבִי יוֹמָם”—“grief in my heart all day.” Meiri glosses: “אפילו היום שמצד טרדת העסקים אדם שוכח יגונו”—even during the day, when the busyness of affairs usually makes a person forget his sorrow, “I am not like that.” The temporal adverb יוֹמָם (“by day,” “all day”) thus sharpens, rather than softens, the ache: even the hours that are normally a reprieve are heavy.

The ambiguity of עֵצוֹת may be deliberate. In the Psalter, “counsel” is something one can receive from the wicked (Psalm 1:1: “בַּעֲצַת רְשָׁעִים”) or from God (“בַּעֲצָתְךָ תַנְחֵנִי”—“You guide me with Your counsel,” Psalm 73:24). Psalm 13 depicts the interim state: in the perceived absence of divine counsel, the sufferer is stuck looping through his own.

The third colon returns to the enemy: “עַד־אָנָה יָרוּם אֹיְבִי עָלָי”—“How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?” As noted earlier, רוּם, “to be high,” is a vertical image. In Psalm 27, trust in God eventually flips that hierarchy: “וְעַתָּה יָרוּם רֹאשִׁי עַל אֹיְבַי סְבִיבוֹתַי”—“And now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me” (27:6). Here the enemy’s superior position is still unchallenged.

It is worth noticing how tightly structured this verse is. The three cola move from internal (“in my life,” “in my heart”) to external (“over me”), and the four stress points of עַד־אָנָה across verses 2–3 create what one might call a total lament: life with God (forgetting, hidden face), life with oneself (ceaseless planning, chronic grief), life with others (domination by an enemy) are all under strain.

Related psalms expand each of these circles at length—Psalm 42–43 on inner turmoil, Psalm 27 on enemies and shining faces. Psalm 13 compresses them into two breathless verses, like a cry caught in the chest.

**Verse 4**

הַבִּיטָה עֲנֵנִי יְהוָה אֱלֹהָי;  
הָאִירָה עֵינַי פֶּן־אִישַׁן הַמָּוֶת׃  

With verse 4 the psalm shifts from description to direct address. Three short imperatives—“Look,” “Answer me,” “Light up my eyes”—replace the hammered “How long?”. The double divine name “יְהוָה אֱלֹהָי” (“LORD, my God”) tightens the relationship: not just the covenant name YHWH, but YHWH to whom I can say “my God,” even now.

“Look” (הַבִּיטָה) answers “hide Your face.” Where verse 2 imagined God concealing His face, verse 4 demands that He fix His gaze. The verb נבט in this form often means “look attentively” or “regard.” In Isaiah 22:8, God “looks to the armor house” (וְאֶל־נֶשֶׁק בֵּית הַיַּעַר תַּבִּיט), not with a casual glance but with evaluating attention.

“Answer me” (עֲנֵנִי) presupposes that the psalmist has been calling and hearing nothing. Psalm 4 opens similarly: “בְּקָרְאִי עֲנֵנִי אֱלֹהֵי צִדְקִי”—“When I call, answer me, God of my right” (4:2). Many laments follow the same script: complaint, then a simple, urgent “Answer.”

The third petition is more specific and more daring: “הָאִירָה עֵינַי פֶּן־אִישַׁן הַמָּוֶת”—“Light up my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death.” The verb אוֹר in the causative form means “make shine.” When the sanctuary lamp is to be lit, God tells Moses “לְהַעֲלֹת נֵר תָּמִיד”—“to cause a lamp to go up continually” (Exodus 27:20). Applied to eyes, it suggests the visible return of vitality. Jonathan’s eyes “brighten” (וַתָּאֹרְנָה עֵינָיו) after eating honey in 1 Samuel 14:27. Proverbs 29:13 says: “רָשׁ וְאִישׁ תְּכָכִים נִפְגָּשׁוּ; מֵאִיר עֵינֵי שְׁנֵיהֶם יְהוָה”—“The poor man and the oppressor meet; the LORD gives light to the eyes of both.” In that proverb, “lighting the eyes” is a metaphor for sustaining life itself.

“Sleep of death” (שֵׁנַת הַמָּוֶת) presses the common biblical equation of sleep and death. Jeremiah 51:39, speaking of Babylon’s revelers, says “וְיֵשְׁנוּ שֵׁנַת עוֹלָם וְלֹא יִקָּצוּ”—“they shall sleep an everlasting sleep and not wake.” Rashi, on our verse, notes simply: “שֶׁהַמִּיתָה נִקְרֵאת שֵׁינָה”—death is called sleep. The psalmist is not asking for a few more comfortable nights; he is asking to be kept from the irreversible “sleep” in which eyes never again shine.

As noted in the introduction, Jewish bedtime ritual has tamed this wild plea into daily piety. The Bedtime Shema includes: “וְהָאֵר עֵינַי פֶּן אִישַׁן הַמָּוֶת”—“Light up my eyes lest I sleep the sleep of death.” Every night, the worshipper acknowledges that the passage into unconsciousness brushes against death, and that waking up is a small act of grace.

There is also a quiet dialogue here with Psalm 4. There, confidence allows the psalmist to say, “בְּשָׁלוֹם יַחְדָּו אֶשְׁכְּבָה וְאִישָׁן”—“In peace, all together, I will lie down and sleep” (4:9). In Psalm 13, by contrast, sleep threatens to be “the sleep of death.” The difference is not in physiology but in theology: in Psalm 4 the sleeper feels held; in Psalm 13 he fears abandonment.

**Verse 5**

פֶּן־יֹאמַר אֹיְבִי יְכׇלְתִּיו;  
צָרַי יָגִילוּ כִּי אֶמּוֹט׃  

Here the psalmist gives voice to what he fears his enemies will say and feel if God does not intervene. The repeated פֶּן (“lest”) ties this verse back to “lest I sleep the sleep of death” in verse 4: there are two unacceptable outcomes—my extinction and my enemy’s triumph.

“Lest my enemy say, ‘יְכׇלְתִּיו’”—“I have prevailed over him.” The verb יָכֹל means “to be able” or “to prevail.” It is famously used of Jacob’s mysterious wrestling partner: “כִּי־שָׂרִיתָ עִם־אֱלֹהִים וְעִם־אֲנָשִׁים, וַתּוּכָל”—“for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed” (Genesis 32:29). An enemy claiming “I have prevailed over him” is not just announcing a tactical win; he is asserting superior power.

The second colon generalizes from a singular enemy (אֹיְבִי) to plural adversaries (צָרַי): “my foes will exult when I totter.” Malbim draws a neat distinction: a צַר is one who actively causes distress; an אוֹיֵב is one who bears enmity, even if not yet acting. Here both are in view: those who hate me and those who press me. Their anticipated response is “יָגִילוּ”—they will “exult,” a verb for intense, almost jubilant joy.

That verb will echo in the next verse. The enemies’ hoped-for “exultation” at the psalmist’s fall becomes, instead, the psalmist’s own joy in God’s salvation: “יָגֵל לִבִּי בִּישׁוּעָתֶךָ”—“my heart will exult in Your salvation” (v. 6). The psalm does not deny that someone will rejoice; it simply relocates the rejoicing.

The last word of the verse, “אֶמּוֹט”—“I totter,” brings back a familiar psalmic root. As we saw, many psalms use מוט to describe the ideal state of the righteous: “עוֹשֵׂה אֵלֶּה לֹא יִמּוֹט לְעוֹלָם”—“Who does these things shall never be shaken” (Psalm 15:5); “בַּל אֶמּוֹט”—“I shall not totter” (16:8). Psalm 21, another Davidic “לַמְנַצֵּחַ,” says of the king: “כִּי־הַמֶּלֶךְ בֹּטֵחַ בַּיהוָה, וּבְחֶסֶד עֶלְיוֹן בַּל־יִמּוֹט”—“For the king trusts in the LORD, and through the steadfast love of the Most High he shall not be shaken” (21:8). Here, by contrast, the psalmist is on the verge of that very shaking.

The logic of the verse is almost Deuteronomic. Deuteronomy 32:27 depicts God restraining His wrath “לְמַעַן לֹא־יֹאמְרוּ צָרֵינוּ”—“lest our adversaries say” that their own hand has triumphed. In both texts, the key concern is not simply the fate of Israel but the story that will be told about God if Israel falls. The psalmist leverages that concern: if I collapse, You will be misread.

**Verse 6**

וַאֲנִי בְּחַסְדְּךָ בָטַחְתִּי;  
יָגֵל לִבִּי בִּישׁוּעָתֶךָ;  
אָשִׁירָה לַיהוָה כִּי גָמַל עָלָי׃  

The closing verse is so familiar from liturgy that it is easy to miss how daring it is. After four “How long?”s and two “lest”s, we might expect a report of rescue: “You have heard; You have saved.” Instead, we get a confession of trust and a promise to sing, with no narrative bridge.

The opening “וַאֲנִי”—“But as for me”—pivots away from both enemies and imagined outcomes. “בְּחַסְדְּךָ בָטַחְתִּי”—“In Your *chesed* I have trusted.” חֶסֶד is one of the densest words in biblical Hebrew: kindness, mercy, but above all covenantal loyalty. God’s חֶסֶד is what endures “forever” even when everything else shifts: “כִּי לְעוֹלָם חַסְדּוֹ” (Psalm 136, refrain). To say “I have trusted in Your ḥesed” is to throw oneself not on any particular promise of outcome but on God’s character as bound to His people.

The verb is in the perfect: בָטַחְתִּי, “I have trusted.” This is not a sudden leap but a reaffirmation of a settled posture, now brought to speech in extremis. The next line moves into the future: “יָגֵל לִבִּי בִּישׁוּעָתֶךָ”—“My heart will exult in Your salvation.” Not “if You save me,” but “when.” The psalmist is, grammatically, already living inside the rescue.

The final colon is the most paradoxical: “אָשִׁירָה לַיהוָה כִּי גָמַל עָלָי”—“I will sing to the LORD, for He has dealt bountifully with me.” גָמַל can mean “deal fully with,” “repay,” or “ripen, bring to completion.” Psalm 116:7 uses it retrospectively: “שׁוּבִי נַפְשִׁי לִמְנוּחָיְכִי, כִּי ה’ גָּמַל עָלָיִכִי”—“Return, my soul, to your rest, for the LORD has dealt bountifully with you,” after describing a brush with death. Psalm 103:10 says God “has not dealt with us (לֹא גָמַל עָלֵינוּ) according to our sins.” Here, however, the perfect tense sits on the lip of the future. From the flow of the psalm, deliverance has not yet arrived; yet the singer speaks of it as already accomplished.

This is what commentators mean by “prophetic perfect”: using a past-tense form to describe a future event whose certainty, under God’s promise, is as good as completion. Malbim adds a theological nuance: the psalmist trusted only in חֶסֶד, sheer grace; but God’s גְּמוּל, His “dealing,” treats that grace as though it were earned, crediting the sufferer with a merit he does not in fact possess. Hence the double joy: not just that I am saved, but that You have dignified me by treating me as worth saving.

The verse also resolves the tension introduced in verse 5. There, the enemies hope to “exult” (יָגִילוּ) at the psalmist’s tottering. Here the very same root appears: “יָגֵל לִבִּי”—“my heart will exult”—and the tottering is replaced by song. The web of מוט/בַּל־יִמּוֹט across Psalms 13 and 21 is worth recalling. Psalm 21:8—“through the steadfast love of the Most High he shall not be shaken”—is almost a gloss on this verse: trust in חֶסֶד is what prevents the tottering feared in 13:5.

In the Greek Septuagint, verse 6 ends with a slightly expanded phrase: “I will sing to the name of the Lord Most High” (ψαλῶ τῷ ὀνόματι κυρίου τοῦ ὑψίστου). The translator heightens the cosmic scope: the God who seemed so absent is in fact “Most High,” worthy of a song that reaches beyond the individual crisis.

In Jewish liturgy, as we have seen, this verse has been torn from its original context of unanswered lament and sown into contexts of praise—daily, on Rosh Hashanah, on Simchat Torah. That is already an interpretation. The tradition bets, with the psalmist, that it is legitimate to say “He has dealt bountifully with me” before the evidence is in—that faith, in other words, is itself a way of telling time.
