## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (11)

1. What is the theological significance of God 'forgetting' (שָׁכַח) in covenant contexts? How does this relate to God 'remembering' Noah (Gen 8:1), Rachel (Gen 30:22), and the covenant (Exod 2:24)?
2. How does 'hiding the face' (הסתיר פנים) function in Deuteronomistic theology (Deut 31:17-18; 32:20) versus Psalms? Is this metaphor exclusively negative, or can it be disciplinary?
3. What does עֵצוֹת (cares/counsels) signify in v. 3? Does this suggest mental deliberation, anxiety, or futile self-reliance versus trust in God's counsel (Ps 1:1; 73:24)?
4. How does the 'sleep of death' (אִישַׁן הַמָּוֶת) relate to Sheol theology and the psalmists' understanding of death as silence (Ps 6:6; 30:10; 88:11-13)?
5. What is the function of the enemy motif in individual laments? Are these concrete historical enemies, spiritual forces, death itself, or symbolic representatives of anti-God forces?
6. How does חֶסֶד (steadfast love/faithfulness) function as the theological hinge enabling the shift from complaint to trust? What is its covenantal freight?
7. What is the temporal logic of בָטַחְתִּי (perfect: 'I have trusted')? Does this indicate habitual past action, or is it a performative present masked as perfect?
8. Is גָמַל עָלָי (he has been good/dealt bountifully) a true prophetic perfect, or does it recall past deliverances as warrant for present confidence? What other psalms use this verb?
9. How does Psalm 13's structure compare to other brief laments (Ps 3-7)? Is the speed of transition from lament to trust proportional to psalm length, or is this uniquely abrupt?
10. What is the significance of singing (שׁיר) as the final verb? How does song function differently from prayer/petition in Psalms? Does singing require deliverance first, or can it precede it?
11. How do the LXX additions in v. 6 ('I will sing to the name of the Lord Most High') expand the psalm's theology? What does this reveal about early interpretive traditions?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (5)

1. What is the precise semantic range of 'עֵצוֹת' (v. 3), and does it imply the psalmist is engaged in anxious internal deliberation that he must move beyond into trust?
2. How does the abrupt 'וַאֲנִי' (But I) in v. 6 function rhetorically? Is it a defiant act of will, a moment of revelation, or a liturgical structure designed to model faith?
3. Is the final verb 'גָמַל' (he has dealt bountifully) a true 'prophetic perfect' (speaking of the future as past), or does it recall a specific past act of God's goodness that serves as the basis for present trust?
4. What is the theological significance of God 'forgetting' (v. 2), and how does this accusation function within a covenant relationship where God promises to 'remember'?
5. How does the psalm's structure, particularly the unexplained resolution in v.6, challenge or redefine the typical cause-and-effect logic of petition-prayer?
