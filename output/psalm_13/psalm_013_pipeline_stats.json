      "How does 'hiding the face' (הסתיר פנים) function in Deuteronomistic theology (Deut 31:17-18; 32:20) versus Psalms? Is this metaphor exclusively negative, or can it be disciplinary?",
      "What does עֵצוֹת (cares/counsels) signify in v. 3? Does this suggest mental deliberation, anxiety, or futile self-reliance versus trust in God's counsel (Ps 1:1; 73:24)?",
      "How does the 'sleep of death' (אִישַׁן הַמָּוֶת) relate to Sheol theology and the psalmists' understanding of death as silence (Ps 6:6; 30:10; 88:11-13)?",
      "What is the function of the enemy motif in individual laments? Are these concrete historical enemies, spiritual forces, death itself, or symbolic representatives of anti-God forces?",
      "How does חֶסֶד (steadfast love/faithfulness) function as the theological hinge enabling the shift from complaint to trust? What is its covenantal freight?",
      "What is the temporal logic of בָטַחְתִּי (perfect: 'I have trusted')? Does this indicate habitual past action, or is it a performative present masked as perfect?",
      "Is גָמַל עָלָי (he has been good/dealt bountifully) a true prophetic perfect, or does it recall past deliverances as warrant for present confidence? What other psalms use this verb?",
      "How does Psalm 13's structure compare to other brief laments (Ps 3-7)? Is the speed of transition from lament to trust proportional to psalm length, or is this uniquely abrupt?",
      "What is the significance of singing (שׁיר) as the final verb? How does song function differently from prayer/petition in Psalms? Does singing require deliverance first, or can it precede it?",
      "How do the LXX additions in v. 6 ('I will sing to the name of the Lord Most High') expand the psalm's theology? What does this reveal about early interpretive traditions?"

      "What is the semantic range and theological freight of עֵצוֹת in v.3 - does it mean anxious deliberations, futile self-counseling, or simply 'cares'? How does this word choice relate to divine counsel theology elsewhere in Psalms?",
      "Why does the psalm use the unusual phrase 'sleep of death' (אִישַׁן הַמָּוֶת) rather than simply 'die' - what does the sleep metaphor contribute to understanding Sheol/death theology in Psalms?",
      "How does the fourfold עַד־אָנָה repetition function symbolically - is there significance to four (divine name tetragammaton, cardinal directions, completeness) or is this simply maximum tolerable repetition?",
      "What accounts for the abrupt shift to trust in v.6 without any narrative explanation (no theophany, oracle, or tangible deliverance) - is this a performative speech act where declaring trust constitutes trust?",
      "Is the final verb גָמַל עָלָי (v.6) a true prophetic perfect (future treated as accomplished) or does it recall past deliverances as warrant for present confidence? What other psalms use this verb in similar contexts?",
      "Why does the petition for eye-illumination (הָאִירָה עֵינַי) specifically reverse God's hidden face rather than simply asking 'show your face' - what does the eye/light focus contribute?",
      "Who are the enemies in vv.3,5 - personal opponents, national foes, death personified, or symbolic anti-God forces? How does their vagueness function rhetorically?",
      "What is the relationship between חֶסֶד (steadfast love, v.6) and God's hidden פָּנִים (face, v.2) - can covenant love persist when covenant face is absent?",
      "How does the LXX expansion in v.6 (adding 'I will sing psalms to the name of the Lord Most High') interpret the original Hebrew theology - what does this reveal about early Jewish understanding of praise-before-deliverance?",
      "Why specify 'grief in my heart all day' (יוֹמָם) in v.3 - does night bring relief, or is this synecdoche for totality? What does temporal specification contribute to the complaint?",
