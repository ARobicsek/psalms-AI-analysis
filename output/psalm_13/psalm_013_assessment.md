# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 13

The existing introduction and commentary are already strong: they take the psalm seriously as poetry, attend to Hebrew, and draw intelligently on Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Radak, Malbim, and Meiri. The fourfold עַד־אָנָה (“How long”), the ambiguity of עֵצוֹת, the “prophetic perfect” of גָמַל עָלַי, and the chiastic play of hidden face / dim eyes are all well observed. The draft also notices the lexical reversal from the enemies’ יָגִילוּ to the psalmist’s יָגֵל and connects verse 6 thoughtfully to Jewish liturgy.

The weaknesses are mainly of emphasis and completeness rather than error. For a lay-but-literate audience, the tone sometimes drifts toward seminar-room prose: grammatical labels (Hiphil, Qal, prophetic perfect) appear without enough “why this matters” explanation. Several compelling questions raised in the macro/micro analysis are only half-answered: for instance, how “hiding the face” functions in Deuteronomy versus Psalms; whether גָמַל is purely future or also recalls past grace; and how Psalm 13 converses with other psalms (4, 21, 27) that share its vocabulary of trust, light, and enemies.

The biggest missed opportunity is comparative quotation. The draft *mentions* many parallels—Deut 31, Jer 51, Ps 1, Ps 73, the Aaronic blessing, other “hidden face” texts—but rarely shows them. For this audience, seeing the Hebrew alongside a translation is indispensable. Likewise, the liturgical section is accurate but thin: it notes that verse 6 appears in Shacharit, but does not quote its actual placement with אַשְׁרֵי הָעָם or the Bedtime Shema’s use of פֶּן אִישַׁן הַמָּוֶת, or the selichot adaptations on 20 Sivan.

Poetically, some devices are asserted rather than demonstrated (e.g., the sound-shift from guttural to flowing); phonetic analysis should be used more sparingly and precisely. The related-psalms analysis (Psalms 4, 21, 27) is almost untouched, though it could illuminate how Psalm 13 condenses a larger pattern of fear and trust.

The revision should therefore: (1) keep the existing strengths; (2) tighten the prose; (3) quote key parallels (biblical and liturgical) with Hebrew and English; (4) integrate the related psalms; and (5) sharpen explanations of technical points for non-specialists.
