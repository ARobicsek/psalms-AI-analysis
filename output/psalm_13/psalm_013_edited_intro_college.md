### A six‑verse crash course in faith under pressure

If you want to see faith under pressure, Psalm 13 is six verses of concentrated drama.

It starts with a scream:  

> עַד־אָ֣נָה יְהוָה תִּשְׁכָּחֵנִי נֶצַח;  
> עַד־אָ֓נָה ׀ תַּסְתִּיר אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ מִמֶּנִּי׃  
> “How long, LORD, will You forget me forever?  
> How long will You hide Your face from me?”

By the end, the same speaker is saying calmly:

> וַאֲנִי בְּחַסְדְּךָ בָטַחְתִּי;  
> יָגֵל לִבִּי בִּישׁוּעָתֶךָ.  
> אָשִׁירָה לַיהוָה, כִּי גָמַל עָלָי׃  
> “But I, in Your *ḥesed* have trusted;  
> my heart will exult in Your deliverance.  
> I will sing to the LORD,  
> for He has dealt bountifully with me.”

Nothing in between tells us that God ever answered. There’s no earthquake, no prophet bursting in with an oracle. The only thing that obviously changes is the *speaking*. That’s the psalm’s central trick—and its teaching.

### A quick map of what we’re reading

Psalm 13 has three short movements:

1. **vv.2–3 – The “How long?” barrage**  
   Four times we get עַד־אָנָה (*ʿad anah*, “How long?”). Repeating the same phrase at the start of several lines is called **anaphora**—a rhetorical device where repetition hammers something in emotionally. Here it sounds like someone hitting “refresh” on heaven and nothing loads.

2. **vv.4–5 – The emergency prayer**  
   The tone shifts from complaint about God to direct commands to God: “Look!” “Answer!” “Light up my eyes!” The psalmist also explains *why* God should act: not just to save him, but to prevent enemies from gloating.

3. **v.6 – The pivot to trust and song**  
   Out of nowhere: “But I have trusted… my heart will exult… I will sing… for He has dealt bountifully with me.” The Hebrew verbs here are crucial; we’ll come back to them.

Once you see this shape, you can feel the emotional arc: desperation → urgent petition → chosen trust.

### God who “forgets” and God who “hides His face”

The first two complaints give us two pictures of divine absence:

> תִּשְׁכָּחֵנִי נֶצַח — “You forget me *forever*”  
> תַּסְתִּיר אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ — “You hide Your face”

The verb שָׁכַח (“to forget”) and its opposite זָכַר (“to remember”) are covenant words in the Bible. When God “remembers,” He acts on His promises:

- “וַיִּזְכֹּר אֱלֹהִים אֶת־נֹחַ” – “God remembered Noah” (Gen 8:1) and started ending the flood.  
- “וַיִּזְכֹּר אֱלֹהִים אֶת־רָחֵל” – “God remembered Rachel” (Gen 30:22) and she conceives.

So to say “You have *forgotten* me” is to say, “The covenant has stopped working—at least for me.”

“Hiding the face” is another loaded idiom. In the priestly blessing we ask:

> יָאֵר יְהוָה פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ —  
> “May the LORD make His *face* shine upon you” (Num 6:25).

God’s “face” = God’s felt presence, attention, and favor. When God threatens Israel in Deuteronomy, He says:

> וְהִסְתַּרְתִּי פָנַי מֵהֶם …  
> “I will hide My face from them…” (Deut 31:17–18).

So our psalm borrows the language of covenant curse—but the speaker never confesses sin. That’s the tension: “I haven’t abandoned You, but it feels like You’ve abandoned me.”

Psalm 27 plays with the same idiom but in a more hopeful tone:

> אַל־תַּסְתֵּר פָּנֶיךָ מִמֶּנִּי … אֱלֹהֵי יִשְׁעִי׃  
> “Do not hide Your face from me… O God of my deliverance” (Ps 27:9).

Psalm 13 is the stripped‑down, raw version.

### When God is silent: plans, anxiety, and the enemy on top

Verse 3 turns from God’s behavior to its impact on the speaker:

> עַד־אָ֨נָה אָשִׁית עֵצוֹת בְּנַפְשִׁי,  
> יָגוֹן בִּלְבָבִי יוֹמָם;  
> עַד־אָ֓נָה ׀ יָרוּם אֹיְבִי עָלָי׃  
>  
> “How long must I set *ʿeṣot* in my *nefesh*,  
> grief in my heart by day?  
> How long will my enemy be exalted over me?”

The little word עֵצוֹת (*ʿeṣot*) is nicely ambiguous. It comes from עֵצָה, which can mean “plan/counsel” or “thoughts/cares.” Medieval commentators split:

- **Ibn Ezra**: “I devise *plans* within myself”—desperate self‑rescue schemes, because God’s counsel seems missing.
- **Metzudat David**: “I set *thoughts* [of how] to escape the grief that is in my heart all day”—anxious ruminations.

Probably the poet likes both: instead of resting in God’s עֵצָה (“counsel”), as in:

> בַּעֲצָתְךָ תַּנְחֵנִי — “By Your counsel You guide me” (Ps 73:24),

the psalmist is stuck in his own looping *ʿeṣot*, and it is exhausting.

The word יוֹמָם (“by day / all day long”) is important. This isn’t a sudden panic attack; it’s chronic. The Meiri comments that even during the day, when people usually forget their troubles because they’re busy, this psalmist can’t get away from his grief.

And then there’s the enemy: יָרוּם אֹיְבִי עָלָי — “my enemy is lifted up over me.” The verb רוּם (“to be high”) gives a literal spatial metaphor: the enemy is “above,” the speaker “below.” Later psalms flip this: in Psalm 27:6, “now my head will be lifted up above my enemies” (*יָרוּם רֹאשִׁי עַל אֹיְבַי*). Psalm 13 is the “before” picture.

### “Look. Answer. Light up my eyes.”

Verses 4–5 switch from “How long?” questions to three imperatives (command forms):

> הַבִּיטָה, עֲנֵנִי יְהוָה אֱלֹהָי;  
> הָאִירָה עֵינַי, פֶּן־אִישַׁן הַמָּוֶת׃  
>  
> “*Look*, answer me, LORD my God!  
> *Make my eyes shine*, lest I sleep the sleep of death.”

- **הַבִּיטָה** (*habbîtah*) – “Look intently.” This is not “glance over here”; it’s “Pay focused attention,” the opposite of hiddenness.
- **עֲנֵנִי** (*ʿanēni*) – “Answer me.” The verb ענה in this sense assumes a prior cry. God’s silence is experienced as refusing to pick up the phone.
- **הָאִירָה עֵינַי** (*hāʾîrā ʿênay*) – literally “make my eyes shine.” In Hebrew, shining eyes = vitality. Jonathan tastes honey and “his eyes brightened” (1 Sam 14:27). The BDB lexicon notes this specific nuance: when God “enlightens the eyes,” He restores life, not just eyesight.

Then the great euphemism: פֶּן־אִישַׁן הַמָּוֶת — “lest I sleep the sleep of death.” Calling death “sleep” is common:

> “וְיָשְׁנוּ שְׁנַת עוֹלָם” —  
> “They shall sleep an everlasting sleep” (Jer 51:39).

Here the phrase “sleep of death” squeezes the metaphor and the reality together. The psalmist is not just tired; he feels close to actual dying.

Jewish liturgy picks up this line in the **Bedtime Shema**. Before sleep, many say:

> וְהָאֵר עֵינַי פֶּן אִישַׁן הַמָּוֶת —  
> “Enlighten my eyes lest I sleep the sleep of death.”

Every night’s sleep becomes a mini‑version of Psalm 13’s crisis: “Bring me back in the morning.”

### When God’s reputation is on the line

The next verse explains why God should care:

> פֶּן־יֹאמַר אֹיְבִי יְכׇלְתִּיו;  
> צָרַי יָגִילוּ כִּי אֶמּוֹט׃  
>  
> “Lest my enemy say, ‘I have prevailed over him’;  
> my foes will exult when I totter.”

The verb יָכֹל (“to be able / to prevail”) is the same root used in Jacob’s wrestling story:

> “כִּי־שָׂרִיתָ עִם־אֱלֹהִים וְעִם־אֲנָשִׁים וַתּוּכָל” —  
> “You have wrestled with God and with men, and have *prevailed*” (Gen 32:29).

So when the enemy says יְכׇלְתִּיו (“I have prevailed over him”), it’s not just “I won the fight”; it hints at “My power, or my god, beat his God.” That’s why Radak can hear this psalm as both David’s personal prayer *and* as the voice of Israel in exile: if God’s people fall, God’s reputation falls with them.

Notice also the emotional verb יָגִילוּ (*yāgîlū*, “they will exult”). It’s not calm satisfaction; it’s gloating joy. That word will come back with a twist.

### The sudden “But I…”

Then, with no warning, verse 6:

> וַאֲנִי בְּחַסְדְּךָ בָטַחְתִּי;  
> יָגֵל לִבִּי בִּישׁוּעָתֶךָ;  
> אָשִׁירָה לַיהוָה, כִּי גָמַל עָלָי׃  

Several things happen at once.

1. **“But I” (וַאֲנִי)**  
   The little וַאֲנִי (“But I”) sets a contrast: “Enemies might gloat, circumstances are awful—but this is how *I* will stand.” It’s a defiant word.

2. **Trust as a completed action**  
   בָטַחְתִּי (*bataḥtî*) is in the Hebrew **perfect tense**—a form usually describing completed action: “I have trusted.” The poet doesn’t say, “Okay, now I’ll start trusting.” He claims a history: trust has been his basic posture all along, underneath the anguish.

   The object of trust is בְּחַסְדְּךָ (*beḥasdekhā*), God’s *ḥesed*. *Ḥesed* is one of those big biblical words; BDB lists shades like “kindness,” “mercy,” “steadfast love.” The key idea is **covenant loyalty**—love that sticks by a relationship. So even when God’s *face* feels absent (hidden), God’s *ḥesed* is what the psalmist stakes everything on.

3. **The joy reversal**  
   Remember the enemies “exulting” (*יָגִילוּ*) in v.5? Now:

   > יָגֵל לִבִּי בִּישׁוּעָתֶךָ —  
   > “*My heart* will exult in Your salvation.”

   Same root גיל, but the subject has switched. The joy the enemies were fantasizing about ends up in the psalmist’s heart. That’s poetic justice.

4. **Singing before the rescue**  
   אָשִׁירָה לַיהוָה — “I will sing to the LORD.” In Hebrew this imperfect form can mean “I will (in the future)” but also has a **jussive** flavor—expressing a choice or resolve: “Let me sing / I am determined to sing.”

   In other psalms, singing usually happens *after* God rescues (e.g., Psalm 30: “You turned my mourning into dancing… therefore I will sing to You”). Here, the decision to sing is part of the move of trust, even before we hear of any actual deliverance.

5. **“For He has dealt bountifully with me” – the prophetic perfect**

   כִּי גָמַל עָלָי (*kî gāmal ʿalay*) is literally “for He has dealt (fully) with me.” The verb גמל can mean “to deal out / repay” or “to do good to.” Psalm 103:10 uses it negatively:

   > “וְלֹא כַעֲוֹנֹתֵינוּ גָּמַל עָלֵינוּ” —  
   > “He has not dealt with us according to our iniquities.”

   Psalm 116:7 uses it positively:

   > “שׁוּבִי נַפְשִׁי לִמְנוּחָיְכִי, כִּי יְהוָה גָּמַל עָלָיִכִי” —  
   > “Return, my soul, to your rest, for the LORD has dealt bountifully with you.”

   In Psalm 116 the speaker is looking back *after* deliverance. In Psalm 13, we never actually see the rescue—but the verb is still perfect (“has dealt”). Many scholars call this the **prophetic perfect**: using a past‑tense form to talk about a future act that is so certain, you can speak of it as already done. It’s like a sports fan saying, “We *won* the championship” when the game is still in the third quarter.

   Malbim notices a nuance: the psalmist originally trusted only in sheer *ḥesed*, not in any sense of “deserving.” But when God “deals bountifully,” He treats the person *as if* they were worthy. Grace, in Malbim’s reading, ends up dignifying the recipient.

### Psalm 13 in prayer life: from Shabbat mornings to bedtime

Jewish liturgy has adopted this psalm in ways that underline its message.

- On **Shabbat and festivals**, many communities recite the *entire psalm* in the expanded *Pesukei dezimra* (“verses of praise”) at **Shacharit**. It sits among happy psalms praising God’s kingship; its move from “How long?” to “I will sing” adds a dose of realism: praise can grow out of pain.
- Every day, across almost all rites, we recite verse 6 in the morning service, right after:  
  > אַשְׁרֵי הָעָם שֶׁיְהוָה אֱלֹהָיו׃  
  > “Happy is the people whose God is the LORD” (Ps 144:15).  
  Then:  
  > וַאֲנִי בְּחַסְדְּךָ בָטַחְתִּי…  
  The congregation moves from “Happy is that *people*” (third‑person, national) to “But *I* have trusted” (first‑person, individual). The psalm’s own move—from theology in general to “me, right now”—is enacted every morning.
- At night, as we saw, the Bedtime Shema borrows “enlighten my eyes lest I sleep the sleep of death,” quietly training people to see even ordinary sleep as a moment to practice Psalm‑13‑style trust.

Psalm 13 is short, but it ends up all over the daily and yearly cycle, precisely because it gives language for that awkward place where you still feel abandoned and still choose to trust.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

### Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

#### Full psalm

In Ashkenazic and Nusach Sefard traditions, **the entire Psalm 13** is recited during the expanded *Pesukei dezimra* (“Verses of Praise”) at **Shacharit on Shabbat and Festivals**. It appears among psalms like 19, 34, 90–150 that form a long chain of praise. Dropping this intense lament‑turned‑trust into a praise section reminds worshippers that real praise doesn’t ignore suffering; it passes *through* it.

#### Key verses

**Psalm 13:6 – וַאֲנִי בְּחַסְדְּךָ בָטַחְתִּי…**

> וַאֲנִ֤י ׀ בְּחַסְדְּךָ֣ בָטַחְתִּי;  
> יָ֤גֵ֥ל לִבִּ֗י בִּישׁוּעָתֶ֥ךָ;  
> אָשִׁ֥ירָה לַיהוָה, כִּ֖י גָמַ֣ל עָלָֽי׃  
> “But I have trusted in Your kindness;  
> my heart will exult in Your salvation.  
> I will sing to the LORD, for He has dealt bountifully with me.”

Across Ashkenaz, Sefard, and Edot HaMizrach, this verse appears **daily** in weekday *Shacharit* as the final line of the *Hodu* section of *Pesukei dezimra*. It directly follows:

> אַשְׁרֵי הָעָם שֶׁכָּכָה לוֹ;  
> אַשְׁרֵי הָעָם שֶׁיְהוָה אֱלֹהָיו׃ (Ps 144:15)  
> “Happy is the people for whom this is so;  
> happy is the people whose God is the LORD.”

The liturgy then continues:

> וַאֲנִי בְּחַסְדְּךָ בָטַחְתִּי,  
> יָגֵל לִבִּי בִּישׁוּעָתֶךָ…

So the congregation moves from a general statement about “the people” to an individual statement of trust, echoing the psalm’s own structure.

In **Edot HaMizrach** (Eastern) communities, this same verse is also highlighted on **Rosh Hashanah** and **Yom Kippur**, woven into special verse‑chains around the Torah service, emphasizing reliance on divine mercy on the Days of Judgment.

#### Phrases

**Psalm 13:4 – פֶּן־אִישַׁן הַמָּוֶת**

> הָאִירָה עֵינַי, פֶּן־אִישַׁן הַמָּוֶת׃  
> “Make my eyes shine, lest I sleep the sleep of death.”

In all major rites, a slightly expanded version appears in the **Bedtime Shema** (*Kri’at Shema al ha‑Mitah*), in the personal supplications after the blessing *HaMapil*:

> וְתְהֵא מִטָּתִי שְׁלֵמָה לְפָנֶיךָ;  
> וְהָאֵר עֵינַי פֶּן אִישַׁן הַמָּוֶת.  
> “May my bed be complete before You;  
> and enlighten my eyes lest I sleep the sleep of death.”

Each night, the worshipper quietly reenacts Psalm 13: asking God for another morning.

**Psalm 13:2 – עַד־אָ֣נָה יְהוָה**

> עַד־אָ֣נָה יְהוָה תִּשְׁכָּחֵנִי נֶצַח…  
> “How long, LORD, will You forget me forever…?”

In the Sefardic *Selichot* (penitential prayers) for the fast of **20 Sivan**, commemorating historical massacres, a piyyut (liturgical poem) echoes this cry:

> …עַד אָנָה יְהוָה אֶקְרָא מִמֵּצַר  
> “…How long, O LORD, will I call from the straits?”

Here Psalm 13’s personal lament is reused as the voice of a suffering community.
