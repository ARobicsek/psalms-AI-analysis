# Editorial Assessment (College Edition) - Psalm 13

The existing introduction and commentary are rich, learned, and make many excellent observations. Strengths include: close attention to Hebrew (e.g., *נֶצַח*, *עֵצוֹת*, *גָמַל*), good use of classical Jewish commentators, and sharp literary insights such as the reversal of *יָגִילוּ* (v.5) to *יָגֵל* (v.6) and the “hidden face / enlightened eyes” pattern. The overall macro‑thesis—Psalm 13 as a template for “crisis prayer” that moves from complaint to trust without any visible change of circumstance—is strong and worth keeping.

For a first‑year college audience, though, several problems appear:

- **Too much jargon, too fast.** Terms like “anaphora,” “chiastic,” “prophetic perfect,” “Hiphil,” “Qal,” “covenant curse,” and “Deuteronomistic” are used without clear, student‑friendly definitions.
- **Density and pacing.** Long paragraphs pack in BDB details, rabbinic quotations, and theological claims without enough signposting or “here’s why this matters.”
- **Voice and tone.** The tone is more like a journal article than a brilliant teacher over coffee. There’s little humor, few analogies, and not much hand‑holding through difficult ideas.
- **Missed chances to teach.** The draft mentions but doesn’t really unpack:
  - how *שָׁכַח* (“forget”) vs. *הִסְתִּיר פָּנִים* (“hide the face”) work elsewhere in Tanakh;
  - the “sleep of death” metaphor with concrete examples like Jer 51:39;
  - the connection to related psalms (4, 21, 27) that use the same vocabulary of sleep, trust, light, and enemies.
- **Liturgical section.** It’s informative but not well structured for learners; it needs clearer subsections, more explicit prayer quotations, and better explanation of what *Pesukei dezimra*, *Selichot*, etc. actually are.

In revising, I’ll keep the strong literary and traditional insights but:
- define every technical term as I go;
- break the introduction into clear, titled chunks;
- add concrete examples and a few light analogies;
- integrate cross‑references and liturgical usage in a more obviously “teaching” way;
- rework verse‑by‑verse commentary so each verse begins with the Hebrew line (plus translation) and then walks the reader through what’s going on and why it’s interesting.
