# Verse-by-Verse Commentary: Psalm 13

## Verse 1

לַמְנַצֵּ֗חַ מִזְמ֥וֹר לְדָוִֽד׃

The superscription `לַמְנַצֵּ֗חַ מִזְמ֥וֹר לְדָוִֽד` ("For the leader; a psalm of David") situates this intensely personal lament within the institutional worship life of ancient Israel. The term לַמְנַצֵּחַ (lamnatze'ach), derived from the root נצח meaning "to be pre-eminent" or "to endure," appears in fifty-five psalm titles and likely indicates that these psalms belonged to a curated collection known as "the Director's Collection"—a liturgical anthology predating the final compilation of the Psalter. The Chronicler's usage confirms this technical sense: in 1 Chronicles 15:21, we read that Levites were appointed לְנַצֵּחַ עַל־הַנְּגִינוֹת ("to direct with harps"), establishing נצח as a specialized musical-liturgical term.

What transforms this administrative detail into theological significance is the psalm's journey from David's voice to communal resource. Rashi, writing in the shadow of the First Crusade's massacres, read the fourfold עַד־אָנָה ("How long?") as corresponding to Israel's four exiles under Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome—thus אַרְבַּע פְּעָמִים כְּנֶגֶד אַרְבָּעָה גָּלֻיּוֹת וּבִשְׁבִיל כָּל יִשְׂרָאֵל נֶאֱמַר ("Four times, corresponding to the four kingdoms, and it is stated concerning all Israel"). This hermeneutic move universalizes David's personal crisis. When the temple choirmaster (the מְנַצֵּחַ) received this psalm, he did not treat it as a relic of royal biography but as a repeatable script for any sufferer's encounter with divine absence.

The Davidic attribution (לְדָוִד) functioned similarly. Whether compositional or dedicatory, it established the psalm as paradigmatic—the king's crisis becomes every Israelite's potential reality. Medieval liturgical tradition preserved this democratization: the verse now appears in the daily Shacharit across all rites, immediately following the communal declaration אַשְׁרֵי הָעָם שֶׁיְהוָה אֱלֹהָיו ("Happy is the people whose God is the LORD"). The juxtaposition is striking: from national blessing to individual desperation, the liturgy enacts the psalm's own movement from theological confidence to felt abandonment.

## Verse 2

עַד־אָנָה יְהוָה תִּשְׁכָּחֵנִי נֶצַח; עַד־אָנָה תַּסְתִּיר אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ מִמֶּנִּי׃

The assault of this verse lies in its relentless anaphora and theological audacity. The phrase עַד־אָנָה (`ʿadh-**'Ā**-nāh`, "How long?") hammers twice in succession, with the searing accusation that YHWH has "forgotten" (תִּשְׁכָּחֵנִי) the speaker—and not momentarily but נֶצַח (`**NE**-tsaḥ`, "forever," "perpetually"). This term, from the root נצח meaning "eminence" or "endurance," creates a theological oxymoron: the eternal God is accused of eternal forgetting. The BDB notes that נֶצַח can mean simply "a long duration" (cf. Psalm 9:19, עֶבְיוֹן לֹא יִשָּׁכַח לָנֶצַח, "the needy shall not always be forgotten"), but the hyperbolic force remains—the sufferer experiences divine absence as permanent.

Biblical Hebrew distinguishes carefully between "forgetting" and "ignoring." The verb שָׁכַח implies a lapse of memory, as when God "remembered" (זָכַר) Noah after the flood (Genesis 8:1) or Rachel after years of barrenness (Genesis 30:22). Covenant theology hinges on God's זִכָּרוֹן (memory): "I will remember my covenant" (וְזָכַרְתִּי אֶת־בְּרִיתִי, Leviticus 26:42). To say God "forgets" is to question the covenant's operative force. Radak notes that enemies will interpret this silence as proof that כִּי שָׁכַחְתָּנִי ("You have forgotten me"), making the question not merely personal but public—a matter of covenant reputation.

The second colon escalates from cognitive metaphor to relational one: תַּסְתִּיר אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ מִמֶּנִּי (`tas-**TIY**-r 'eth-pā-**NEY**-khā mim-**MEN**-niy`, "You hide Your face from me"). This idiom, deeply embedded in Israel's theological vocabulary, reverses the Aaronic blessing that petitions יָאֵר יְהוָה פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ ("May the LORD make His face shine upon you," Numbers 6:25). The concordance search reveals this "hidden face" appears primarily in contexts of covenant curse. In Deuteronomy 31:17-18, God warns that if Israel turns to other gods, וְהִסְתַּרְתִּי פָנַי מֵהֶם... וְאָנֹכִי הַסְתֵּר אַסְתִּיר פָּנַי ("I will hide My face from them... and I will surely hide My face"). The psalmist appropriates the curse language but inverts the theodicy: the sufferer has not apostatized, yet experiences the curse anyway.

The figurative language database shows "hidden face" appearing seven times in Psalms, always as withdrawal of divine favor. But Psalm 13 is distinctive—it lacks the penitential framework found elsewhere (contrast Psalm 51:11, "Do not cast me from Your presence"). Here the speaker protests divine absence without confessing sin, creating a crisis of covenantal logic that will drive the psalm's dramatic reversal.

## Verse 3

עַד־אָנָה אָשִׁית עֵצוֹת בְּנַפְשִׁי, יָגוֹן בִּלְבָבִי יוֹמָם; עַד־אָנָה יָרוּם אֹיְבִי עָלָי׃

The third and fourth עַד־אָנָה (`ʿadh-**'Ā**-nāh`) shift the complaint from God's actions to their devastating consequences in the psalmist's inner life and external circumstances. The verse creates a concentric pattern: divine withdrawal (v. 2) → psychological turmoil (v. 3a) → physical vulnerability (v. 3b), moving from theological abstraction to embodied suffering.

The phrase אָשִׁית עֵצוֹת בְּנַפְשִׁי (`'ā-**SHIY**-th ʿē-**TSŌTH** bə-naf-**SHIY**`) presents one of the psalm's most debated lexical puzzles. The noun עֵצוֹת can mean either "counsels" or "cares," and the semantic range profoundly affects interpretation. Ibn Ezra reads it as futile self-reliance: אַחֲשֹׁב וְאָשִׁית עֵצוֹת בְּנַפְשִׁי, כָּל עֵת בַּעֲבוּר הַיָּגוֹן ("I think and devise counsels in my soul, all the time because of the grief"). This reading contrasts human scheming with divine guidance—the speaker, abandoned by God's counsel (עֵצָה), resorts to manufacturing his own. The semantic opposition is pointed: in Psalm 1:1, the righteous avoid walking בַּעֲצַת רְשָׁעִים ("in the counsel of the wicked"), while in Psalm 73:24, God guides with His counsel (בַּעֲצָתְךָ תַנְחֵנִי). Without divine עֵצָה, the sufferer is left with self-generated עֵצוֹת—a poor substitute.

However, the Metzudat David reads עֵצוֹת as "cares" or "anxious thoughts": אָשִׁים עֵצוֹת אֵיךְ לְהִמָּלֵט מִן הַיָּגוֹן אֲשֶׁר בְּלִבָּבִי ("I set thoughts [of how] to escape from the grief that is in my heart"). This interpretation makes the parallel structure with the next phrase more symmetric—both clauses describe internal states rather than contrasting self-reliance with divine absence. The ambiguity may be deliberate, allowing both readings to resonate.

The temporal marker יוֹמָם (`yō-**MĀM**`, "all day," "daily") intensifies the chronic nature of this suffering. The Meiri observes astutely: אֲפִילוּ הַיּוֹם שֶׁמִּצַּד טִרְדַת הָעֲסָקִים אָדָם שׁוֹכֵחַ יְגוֹנוֹ ("even during the day, when due to preoccupation with affairs a person forgets his grief [in my case the grief never departs]"). This is not momentary distress but persistent, unremitting anguish—the kind that becomes one's new baseline reality.

The final colon—יָרוּם אֹיְבִי עָלָי (`yā-**RŪM** 'ō-yə-**VIY** ʿā-**LĀY**`)—completes the concentric movement from inner turmoil to external threat. The root רוּם typically means "to be high" or "to be exalted," and in this Qal form creates a spatial metaphor: the enemy is elevated "over" (עַל) the speaker. This is not a single defeat but an ongoing state of dominance. The enemy remains unnamed—whether personal foe, national adversary, or death itself (as v. 4 will suggest) is deliberately ambiguous, allowing the psalm to function across contexts. The fourfold עַד־אָנָה thus creates a totalizing complaint: cosmic (God's absence), psychological (inner turmoil), temporal (daily grief), and spatial (enemy's elevation)—every dimension of existence is mapped onto the crisis.

## Verse 4

הַבִּיטָה עֲנֵנִי יְהוָה אֱלֹהָי; הָאִירָה עֵינַי פֶּן־אִישַׁן הַמָּוֶת׃

The psalm pivots from complaint to urgent petition with three staccato imperatives that escalate in both intensity and theological intimacy. The first verb, הַבִּיטָה (`ha-biy-**TĀH**`, Hiphil imperative of נבט, "look!"), reverses the divine "hiding" of verse 2. The BDB specifies that the Hiphil of נבט means "to look intently," "to regard with consideration"—not casual glancing but focused attention. In 1 Samuel 16:7, God tells Samuel regarding Eliab: אַל־תַּבֵּט אֶל־מַרְאֵהוּ ("Do not look at his appearance"), using this same causative stem to indicate discerning vision that penetrates surfaces. The psalmist demands that God reverse the hidden face and actively behold.

The second imperative עֲנֵנִי (`ʿa-nē-**NIY**`, "answer me!") appears 19 times in Psalms, predominantly in contexts where the speaker has cried out but received no response. The root ענה in the Qal means "to answer," "to respond," and implies that a question or appeal has preceded it. The psalmist's silence from God is not benign absence but experienced as deliberate non-response—the covenantal equivalent of being ignored. Significantly, this command is framed by the fullest divine name in the psalm: יְהוָה אֱלֹהָי (`yə-hō-**WĀH** 'e-lō-**HĀY**`, "O LORD my God"). Where verse 2 used only יְהוָה, here the vocative adds אֱלֹהָי, intensifying the covenant claim. The possessive suffix asserts relationship even in abandonment: "You are MY God, whether You acknowledge me or not."

The third imperative—הָאִירָה עֵינַי (`hā-**'IY**-rāh ʿēy-**NAY**`, "restore the luster to my eyes," "make my eyes shine")—creates a brilliant chiastic reversal of verse 2's hidden face. There, God concealed פָּנֶיךָ ("Your face"); here, the speaker's עֵינַי ("my eyes") need illumination. The verb האיר in Hiphil means "to cause to shine," "to give light to," but with eyes as object, it carries the specific sense of restoring vitality. The BDB notes this is distinct from physical sight—it's about the luster that leaves eyes during illness, grief, or approaching death. Compare 1 Samuel 14:27, where Jonathan eats honey and וַתָּאֹרְנָה עֵינָיו ("his eyes brightened")—the return of life-force made visible in the eyes. The figurative language database confirms this reading: in Proverbs 29:13, God is described as מֵאִיר־עֵינֵי שְׁנֵיהֶם יְהוָה ("The LORD gives luster to the eyes of both"), parallel to giving life itself.

The motivation clause פֶּן־אִישַׁן הַמָּוֶת (`pen-'iy-**SHAN** ham-**MĀ**-weth`, "lest I sleep the sleep of death") employs a euphemism deeply rooted in biblical idiom. The phrase "sleep of death" appears explicitly here and in Jeremiah 51:39, 57 (of Babylon's enemies), but the equation of death with sleep permeates Scripture. Rashi notes: שֶׁהַמִּיתָה נִקְרֵאת שֵׁינָה, "וְיָשְׁנוּ שְׁנַת עוֹלָם" ("For death is called sleep, [as in Jeremiah 51:39]: 'and sleep a perpetual sleep'"). The construct phrase שְׁנַת הַמָּוֶת literalizes the metaphor—this is not restorative rest but the permanent sleep from which there is no waking. The psalmist stands at the threshold of Sheol, that shadowy realm where, as Psalm 88:11-13 laments, the dead do not praise and God's wonders are unknown.

The liturgical tradition preserves this petition in a poignant context: the Bedtime Shema (Kriat Shema Al HaMitah) incorporates the plea וְהָאֵר עֵינַי פֶּן אִישַׁן הַמָּוֶת ("and enlighten my eyes lest I sleep the sleep of death"), transforming the psalmist's crisis into a nightly petition. Each sleep becomes a minor death from which one prays to be awakened—a Jewish meditation on mortality that reframes the psalm's extremity as a quotidian spiritual practice.

## Verse 5

פֶּן־יֹאמַר אֹיְבִי יְכָלְתִּיו; צָרַי יָגִילוּ כִּי אֶמּוֹט׃

The motivation for divine intervention now shifts from personal survival to theological stakes—the enemy's potential triumph would constitute not merely the psalmist's defeat but a cosmic scandal. The verse consists of two tightly parallel clauses, both introduced by פֶּן ("lest"), projecting a nightmare scenario of enemy vindication.

The first clause—פֶּן־יֹאמַר אֹיְבִי יְכָלְתִּיו (`pen-yō'-**MAR** 'ō-yə-**VIY** yə-khol-**TIY**-w`, "lest my enemy say, 'I have prevailed over him'")—introduces direct discourse, allowing the enemy's hypothetical taunt to reverberate. The verb יָכֹל, "to prevail," "to overcome," appears 193 times in the Hebrew Bible and carries profound theological freight. Its most famous deployment is in Jacob's wrestling match with the divine figure: כִּי־שָׂרִיתָ עִם־אֱלֹהִים וְעִם־אֲנָשִׁים וַתּוּכָל ("you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed," Genesis 32:29). To "prevail" is not merely to win but to demonstrate superior power. If the enemy can say יְכָלְתִּיו, he claims not just military victory but theological superiority—his god (or his autonomous power) has proven stronger than YHWH's protection of His covenant partner.

The second clause—צָרַי יָגִילוּ כִּי אֶמּוֹט (`tsā-**RAY** yā-**GHIY**-lū **KIY** 'em-**MŌT**`, "my foes exult when I totter")—shifts from speech to emotion and from singular enemy (אֹיְבִי) to plural adversaries (צָרַי, "my foes"). The Malbim, with his characteristic precision, distinguishes between צַר and אוֹיֵב: יֵשׁ הֶבְדֵּל בֵּין צַר וְאוֹיֵב, שֶׁהַצַּר הוּא הַמֵּצִיר בְּפֹעַל, וְהָאוֹיֵב דּוֹרֵשׁ רָעָה וְאֵינוֹ מֵצִיר בְּפֹעַל ("There is a difference between 'adversary' [צַר] and 'enemy' [אוֹיֵב]: the adversary afflicts in actuality, while the enemy seeks harm but does not [yet] afflict in actuality"). The plural צָרַי suggests active persecutors, while the singular אֹיְבִי might represent a chief antagonist or, metaphorically, Death itself (as the psalm's trajectory from "sleep of death" to "tottering" implies).

The verb יָגִילוּ (`yā-**GHIY**-lū`, from גיל, "to exult," "to rejoice") will become the site of the psalm's most stunning reversal. This particular verb denotes intense, bodily joy—not quiet satisfaction but visible, sometimes raucous celebration. Its appearance here is proleptic irony: the enemies anticipate exultation, but verse 6 will transfer that very verb to the psalmist's heart (יָגֵל לִבִּי, "my heart will exult"). The poetic justice is precise—the emotional state the enemies covet will be bestowed on the sufferer instead.

The final verb, אֶמּוֹט (`'em-**MŌT**`, Qal imperfect of מוט, "I totter," "I slip," "I am shaken"), describes physical instability but functions metaphorically for complete collapse. The root מוט appears 39 times in Psalms, predominantly in contexts of righteous stability versus wicked downfall. Psalm 15:5 declares of the righteous: עֹשֶׂה אֵלֶּה לֹא יִמּוֹט לְעוֹלָם ("One who does these things shall never be shaken"). The figurative language database reveals that "tottering" imagery consistently describes vulnerability, weakness, and impending ruin—the moment before final collapse. By using this verb, the psalmist positions himself at the edge of the abyss, one tremor away from catastrophic fall.

Radak grasps the corporate dimension latent in this personal crisis: זֶה הַמִּזְמוֹר אֲמָרוֹ דָוִד בְּעֵת שֶׁהָיָה בְּצָרָה מֵאוֹיְבָיו אוֹ נֶאֱמַר עַל לְשׁוֹן הַגָּלוּת; וְהוּא הַנָּכוֹן ("This psalm David spoke in the time when he was in distress from his enemies, or it speaks in the voice of the exile; and this [latter interpretation] is correct"). The individual's survival has communal implications—when "I" totter, the covenant community trembles. The verse thus weaponizes the theological stakes: if God allows the enemy's exultation, it is not only the psalmist who falls but YHWH's own reputation.

## Verse 6

וַאֲנִי בְּחַסְדְּךָ בָטַחְתִּי, יָגֵל לִבִּי בִּישׁוּעָתֶךָ; אָשִׁירָה לַיהוָה כִּי גָמַל עָלָי׃

The psalm's extraordinary reversal occurs without warning, explanation, or narrative transition. No theophany intervenes, no oracle arrives, no circumstance changes—yet the voice transforms from desperate petition to confident declaration. The adversative וַאֲנִי (`wa-'a-**NIY**`, "But I") marks the pivot with stark emphasis: "But **I**—in contrast to the enemies and their anticipated exultation—have another reality."

The first clause—בְּחַסְדְּךָ בָטַחְתִּי (`bə-ḥas-**DKHĀ** vā-taḥ-**TIY**`, "I have trusted in Your steadfast love")—grounds present crisis in past relationship. The verb בָטַחְתִּי is a perfect tense, indicating completed action: "I have trusted" (not "I will trust" or "I am trusting"). This temporal anchoring is theologically crucial. The psalmist does not claim that circumstances have changed or that confidence has suddenly appeared—rather, he declares that trust has been operative all along, beneath and despite the complaint. The object of that trust is God's חֶסֶד (`**KHE**-sedh`), arguably the most theologically dense term in biblical Hebrew. The BDB dedicates an extensive entry to this noun, noting its semantic range includes "kindness," "lovingkindness," "mercy," but most fundamentally, "covenant loyalty." It appears 248 times in the Hebrew Bible, 127 times in Psalms alone, and carries the weight of covenantal obligation—God's חֶסֶד is not arbitrary kindness but His binding commitment to the covenant relationship, operative even when His face is hidden.

The second clause—יָגֵל לִבִּי בִּישׁוּעָתֶךָ (`yā-**GHĒL** li-**BIY** biy-shū-ʿā-**THE**-khā`, "my heart will exult in Your deliverance")—performs the lexical reversal promised in verse 5. There, צָרַי יָגִילוּ כִּי אֶמּוֹט ("my foes exult when I totter"); here, יָגֵל לִבִּי ("my heart will exult"). The identical root גיל is redistributed from enemy to psalmist, from plural adversaries to singular heart. The shift from צָרַי יָגִילוּ (Qal imperfect, 3mp) to יָגֵל לִבִּי (Qal imperfect, 3ms with לִבִּי as subject) is not merely grammatical but cosmically significant—the exultation the enemies sought is awarded to the sufferer instead. The future tense (imperfect) of יָגֵל treats deliverance as assured though not yet arrived. This is the heart of the psalm's performative force: faith reconfigures temporality, allowing future salvation to generate present joy.

The third clause—אָשִׁירָה לַיהוָה (`'ā-**SHIY**-rāh lay-hō-**WĀH**`, "I will sing to the LORD")—introduces song as the ultimate response to salvation. The verb שׁיר in the Qal means simply "to sing," but in the context of Israel's cult, it denotes liturgical praise, the formalized worship response to divine action. The future tense is again striking: "I will sing" projects praise into the anticipated moment of deliverance. This is not merely hopeful—it is enacted proleptically. The very speaking of "I will sing" is already a kind of singing, a performance of praise before the救いgaining.

The final clause—כִּי גָמַל עָלָי (`**KIY** ghā-**MAL** ʿā-**LĀY**`, "for He has dealt bountifully with me")—deploys what grammarians call the "prophetic perfect." The verb גָמַל is perfect tense, indicating completed action: "He **has** dealt," not "He will deal." Yet the deliverance has manifestly not yet occurred—the enemies still threaten, the sleep of death still looms. How can the psalmist say "He has dealt bountifully" when verse 4 still prays "lest I sleep the death of death"? This is the rhetorical genius of the prophetic perfect: faith treats God's future action as already accomplished, collapsing eschatological hope into present reality. The root גמל appears 37 times in biblical Hebrew with meanings ranging from "to complete," "to wean" (i.e., bring to maturity), to "to deal with" (either beneficially or punitively). In Psalm 116:7, after recounting a mortal crisis, the speaker declares: כִּי יְהוָה גָּמַל עָלָיְכִי ("for the LORD has dealt bountifully with you"). Psalm 13 makes the same declaration but without the narrative of rescue—the bounty is confessed before it is experienced.

Jewish liturgy preserves this climactic verse in multiple settings, most significantly in the daily Shacharit service across all traditions, where it appears after אַשְׁרֵי הָעָם שֶׁכָּכָה לוֹ אַשְׁרֵי הָעָם שֶׁיְהוָה אֱלֹהָיו ("Happy is the people for whom this is so, happy is the people whose God is the LORD"). The liturgical juxtaposition creates a profound theological movement: from third-person communal blessing (שֶׁיְהוָה אֱלֹהָיו, "whose God is the LORD") to first-person individual trust (וַאֲנִי בְּחַסְדְּךָ בָטַחְתִּי, "But I have trusted in Your kindness"). The community's theology becomes the individual's lived confession. On Simchat Torah in the Sefardic rite, this verse initiates the Hakafot (circuits with the Torah), linking the rejoicing over Torah with the psalm's movement from distress to deliverance: "הַרְאֵנוּ יְהוָה חַסְדֶּךָ וְיֶשְׁעֲךָ תִּתֶּן לָנוּ. וַאֲנִי בְחַסְדֶּךָ בָטַחְתִּי יָגֵל לִבִּי בִישׁוּעָתֶךָ" ("Show us Your kindness, O LORD, and grant us Your salvation. But I have trusted in Your kindness, my heart will exult in Your salvation"). The joy of Torah reception becomes the concrete instantiation of God's גְּמִילוּת חֶסֶד (dealing bountifully).

Radak reads the verse through the lens of exile: בְּחַסְדְּךָ בָטַחְתִּי בְּבָבֶל; יָגֵל לִבִּי בִישׁוּעָתֶךָ בְּמָדַי; אָשִׁירָה לַיהוָה בְּיָוָן; כִּי גָמַל עָלָי בֶּאֱדוֹם ("'I have trusted in Your kindness'—in Babylon; 'my heart will exult in Your salvation'—in Media; 'I will sing to the LORD'—in Greece; 'for He has dealt bountifully with me'—in Edom"). Each colon represents a stage of Israel's long suffering and incremental hope, with the final Edomite/Roman exile awaiting its resolution. This hermeneutic demonstrates how Psalm 13's structure—fourfold complaint answered by fourfold resolution—invited historical allegorization.

The Malbim, ever alert to lexical precision, notes that the sufferer distinguishes between trust based on חֶסֶד (divine grace unmerited) and joy based on גְּמִילָה (divine recompense as if merited): אֲנִי בָטַחְתִּי רַק בְּחַסְדְּךָ, שֶׁתַּעֲשֶׂה לִי מִצַּד הַחֶסֶד לֹא מִצַּד הַגְּמוּל כִּי אֵינֶנִּי רָאוּי לָזֶה, וְעַתָּה אָשִׁירָה לַיהוָה כִּי גָמַל עָלָי מִצַּד הַגְּמוּל, בְּטוּבוֹ חָשַׁב לִי כְּאִלּוּ אֲנִי רָאוּי לָזֶה מִצַּד מַעֲשַׂי ("I trusted only in Your mercy, that You would act for me from the side of grace, not from the side of recompense, for I am not worthy of this; but now I will sing to the LORD, for He has dealt with me from the side of recompense—in His goodness He reckoned to me as if I were worthy from the side of my deeds"). The theological sophistication here is striking: the psalmist begins with grace alone but concludes with God treating grace as if it were earned—divine generosity that dignifies the recipient by framing unmerited favor as deserved.

The psalm's genius lies in its refusal to resolve the theodicy problem. God's face remains hidden, the enemies still threaten, circumstances remain unchanged—yet trust is declared, joy is anticipated, and song is promised. The transformation occurs not in the world but in the speaking itself, in the performative act of confession that reframes reality according to covenant logic rather than experiential evidence. As the psalmist moves from the harsh, staccato gutturals of עַד־אָנָה (`ʿadh-**'Ā**-nāh`) to the flowing liquids and sibilants of אָשִׁירָה לַיהוָה (`'ā-**SHIY**-rāh lay-hō-**WĀH**`), the very phonetic texture of the language shifts—from interrogative assault to melodic affirmation, from complaint to praise, from death to life.
