“How long, O LORD?”—Psalm 13 is one of the Bible’s briefest laments, yet few lines in Scripture feel so exposed. In six verses the speaker travels from the conviction that God has forgotten him “forever” to a vow to sing because “He has dealt bountifully with me.” No rescue is narrated, no prophet arrives, no enemy is named. All we are given is language: complaint, petition, and then, somehow, trust.

The psalm opens with an institutional heading:

> לַמְנַצֵּחַ מִזְמֹר לְדָוִד׃  
> For the director; a psalm of David.

The word לַמְנַצֵּחַ probably means “for the director” or “choirmaster.” Chronicles uses the same root for Levites “to direct with harps” (1 Chronicles 15:21: לְנַצֵּחַ עַל־הַנְּגִינוֹת). Already, then, this private crisis is destined for public performance. And “of David” does not just name an author; every generation can put its own voice into the royal mouth. Radak can say of this psalm: “דוד בעת שהיה בצרה מאויביו או נאמר על לשון הגלות; והוא הנכון”—David spoke it in distress from his enemies, *or* it speaks in the voice of the exile, “and this is correct.”

#### The fourfold “How long?”

Verses 2–3 strike with the repeated cry עַד־אָנָה, “How long?”:

> עַד־אָ֣נָה יְהוָה תִּשְׁכָּחֵנִי נֶצַח;  
> עַד־אָ֓נָה ׀ תַּסְתִּיר אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ מִמֶּנִּי׃  
> עַד־אָ֨נָה אָשִׁ֪ית עֵצוֹת בְּנַפְשִׁי; יָגוֹן בִּלְבָבִי יוֹמָם;  
> עַד־אָ֓נָה ׀ יָרוּם אֹיְבִי עָלָי׃  

Four times in two verses the psalm hammers at heaven. Rashi, writing after the First Crusade, heard in these four a map of Jewish history: “אַרְבַּע פְּעָמִים כְּנֶגֶד אַרְבָּעָה גָּלֻיּוֹת”—four cries for the four exiles under Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome. Whether or not one accepts that allegory as the original intent, it shows how later Jews heard the psalm: a personal “I” large enough to contain a people’s centuries of waiting.

The four complaints also move in concentric circles. First, God’s behavior:

- “Will You forget me forever?”  
- “Will You hide Your face from me?”

Then the inner fallout:

- “How long shall I place עֵצוֹת in my life, grief in my heart all day?”

And finally, the outer danger:

- “How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?”

The Hebrew of that first question pushes the crisis as far as it can go: תִּשְׁכָּחֵנִי נֶצַח—“Will You forget me *forever*?” נֶצַח can mean simple “perpetuity,” but in a covenantal context it rubs against the Bible’s usual verb for God’s loyalty: זָכַר, “remember.” God “remembered” Noah in the ark (Genesis 8:1), remembered His covenant with the patriarchs when Israel groaned under slavery (Exodus 2:24). Here the psalm dares to suggest the opposite of that bedrock assurance.

The second colon deepens the metaphor: “hide Your face” (תַּסְתִּיר אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ) is biblical shorthand for withdrawing favor. Deuteronomy 31:17–18 makes it a formal covenant curse:

> “וְחָרָה אַפִּי בּוֹ בַּיּוֹם הַהוּא…  
> וְהִסְתַּרְתִּי פָנַי מֵהֶם…  
> וְאָנֹכִי הַסְתֵּר אַסְתִּיר פָּנַי”  
> “My anger shall blaze against them… I will hide My face from them… I will surely hide My face.”

There, the hidden face punishes idolatry. In Psalm 13, by contrast, no sin is confessed. The speaker experiences the curse without the stated cause. That dissonance—“I have not forsaken You, but You seem to have forsaken me”—is the theological tension in which the psalm lives.

#### Plans, grief, and the enemy’s height

Verse 3 turns from heaven to the self:

> “How long shall I place עֵצוֹת in my life,  
> grief in my heart all day?”

עֵצוֹת usually means “counsels” or “plans.” In Psalm 1:1, the happy man avoids “the counsel of the wicked” (בַּעֲצַת רְשָׁעִים); in Psalm 73:24, God “guides me with Your counsel” (בַּעֲצָתְךָ תַנְחֵנִי). Ibn Ezra hears our verse as frantic self-reliance: “אחשוב ואשית עצות בנפשי”—I keep devising plans in my own mind because of the grief. Metzudat David, more psychologically, glosses it as anxious thoughts of escape. The Hebrew can bear both: the mind oscillates between strategy and rumination, trying to think its way out of abandonment.

The grief is “יָגוֹן בִּלְבָבִי יוֹמָם”—“sorrow in my heart all day.” Meiri notes the cruelty of that adverb: “אפילו היום שמצד טרדת העסקים אדם שוכח יגונו”—even the busy daytime, when work usually distracts from pain, does not dull this ache.

Then, “How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?” (יָרוּם אֹיְבִי עָלָי). The verb רוּם, “to be high,” is spatial, almost visual: the enemy looms above. Psalm 27 uses it positively: “וְעַתָּה יָרוּם רֹאשִׁי עַל אֹיְבַי סְבִיבוֹתַי”—“And now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me” (27:6). Psalm 13 gives us the inverse image: for now it is the enemy, not the psalmist, who is “lifted up.”

Who is this enemy? Radak reads historically—David’s pursuers or, on the national level, the empires over Israel. Others have heard in the enemy a personification of death, given the “sleep of death” to come in verse 4. The psalm is deliberately nonspecific, which is why it can be prayed at a hospital bedside or on a national day of mourning with equal force.

#### “Look… answer… light up my eyes”

After four “how longs,” the grammar changes. Verse 4 fires off three imperatives:

> הַבִּיטָה עֲנֵנִי יְהוָה אֱלֹהָי;  
> הָאִירָה עֵינַי פֶּן־אִישַׁן הַמָּוֶת׃  
> “Look, answer me, LORD my God;  
> light up my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death.”

“Look” (הַבִּיטָה) reverses “hide Your face.” Where verse 2 pictured God turning away, verse 4 demands focused attention. “Answer me” insists that the silence has been heard as refusal.

“Light up my eyes” (הָאִירָה עֵינַי) plays against a famous blessing. In the priestly benediction, God is asked to make “His face shine upon you” (יָאֵר יְהוָה פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ, Numbers 6:25). Here the request is reduced to the bare minimum: even if Your face remains hidden, let my *eyes* shine again. In 1 Samuel 14:27 Jonathan tastes honey and “וַתָּאֹרְנָה עֵינָיו”—“his eyes brightened”; Proverbs 29:13 says “מֵאִיר עֵינֵי שְׁנֵיהֶם יְהוָה”—“The LORD gives light to the eyes of both” (rich and poor). To have bright eyes is to be alive, alert, capable of joy.

The alternative is “the sleep of death” (שֵׁנַת הַמָּוֶת). Jeremiah uses similar language of Babylon’s doomed revelers: “וְיֵשְׁנוּ שֵׁנַת עוֹלָם וְלֹא יִקָּצוּ”—“they shall sleep an everlasting sleep and not wake” (Jeremiah 51:39). Sleep here is not repose but the final extinguishing of consciousness.

Jewish liturgy takes this extremity and domesticates it into a nightly ritual. In the Bedtime Shema, one prays: “וּתְהֵא מִטָּתִי שְׁלֵמָה לְפָנֶיךָ, וְהָאֵר עֵינַי פֶּן אִישַׁן הַמָּוֶת”—“May my bed be whole before You, and light up my eyes lest I sleep the sleep of death.” Every going to sleep rehearses Psalm 13’s brinkmanship: I am about to surrender control; return me to wakefulness.

#### “Lest my enemy say…”

Verse 5 shifts the motive from survival to God’s reputation:

> “Lest my enemy say, ‘I have prevailed over him’;  
> my foes will exult when I totter.”

The verb “prevail” (יָכֹל) is the same used of Jacob after wrestling the mysterious figure at the Jabbok: “וַתּוּכָל”—“you have prevailed” (Genesis 32:29). If the enemy can boast “יְכׇלְתִּיו”—“I have prevailed over him”—the implication is theological: my god, or my power, has beaten yours.

Deuteronomy hears God Himself worrying about such talk. After threatening Israel with near-annihilation, God stays His hand “פֶּן־יֹאמְרוּ צָרֵינוּ”—“lest our adversaries say, ‘Our hand is high…’” (Deuteronomy 32:27). Psalm 13 taps the same logic. The psalmist does not say: “Save me because I am miserable,” but: “Save me so that the wrong story is not told about You.”

The last word of verse 5, “I totter” (אֶמּוֹט), is a favorite in Psalms. Of the righteous it is usually negated: “עוֹשֵׂה אֵלֶּה לֹא יִמּוֹט לְעוֹלָם”—“Who does these things shall never be shaken” (Psalm 15:5); “שִׁוִּיתִי ה’ לְנֶגְדִּי תָמִיד… בַּל אֶמּוֹט”—“I set the LORD always before me… I shall not totter” (Psalm 16:8). Here the psalmist stands on the edge, one tremor away from collapse, and imagines his enemies ready to burst into celebration at that moment.

#### Trust as a way of talking about time

Then, without explanation, comes verse 6:

> וַאֲנִי בְּחַסְדְּךָ בָטַחְתִּי;  
> יָגֵל לִבִּי בִּישׁוּעָתֶךָ;  
> אָשִׁירָה לַיהוָה כִּי גָמַל עָלָי׃  
> “But as for me, in Your steadfast love I have trusted;  
> my heart will exult in Your salvation;  
> I will sing to the LORD, for He has dealt bountifully with me.”

The adversative “But I” (וַאֲנִי) marks a swerve as sharp as any in the Psalter. Nothing external has changed; only the grammar has. The trust verb is in the perfect tense—בָטַחְתִּי, “I have trusted”—looking back over a history of dependence: this is not a new decision but the resurfacing of a life-long stance. The joy verb is future—יָגֵל, “my heart will exult”—as is “I will sing” (אָשִׁירָה). And then the closing verb is again perfect: גָמַל, “He has dealt bountifully with me.”

Hebrew sometimes uses the perfect to speak of the future so certain it can be talked about as past; scholars call this the “prophetic perfect.” Psalm 116:7 does something similar: “שׁוּבִי נַפְשִׁי לִמְנוּחָיְכִי, כִּי ה’ גָּמַל עָלָיִכִי”—“Return, my soul, to your rest, for the LORD has dealt bountifully with you,” said in the wake of a narrow escape. Our psalm is bolder: it says “He has dealt bountifully with me” while the enemies are still gloating in imagination.

The key noun is חֶסֶד—God’s “steadfast love,” “covenant loyalty.” It is the word that anchors Israel’s praise: “הוֹדוּ לַיהוָה כִּי־טוֹב, כִּי לְעוֹלָם חַסְדּוֹ”—“Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good, for His ḥesed is everlasting” (Psalm 136:1). Malbim draws a fine distinction: the psalmist trusted only in *ḥesed*—unmerited grace—but God’s גְּמוּל, His “dealing out” good, treats that grace as if it were earned, dignifying the recipient.

Jewish prayer books have singled out verse 6 as a compact creed of faith under pressure. In the weekday morning service it follows the verse “Happy is the people whose God is the LORD” (Psalm 144:15) so that the congregation moves from third-person statement to first-person testimony: “וַאֲנִי בְּחַסְדְּךָ בָטַחְתִּי, יָגֵל לִבִּי בִּישׁוּעָתֶךָ”—“But I, in Your steadfast love have trusted; my heart will rejoice in Your salvation.” On Simchat Torah it is placed on the celebrant’s lips as the Torah is danced around the synagogue. Trust, the liturgy suggests, is not a reward for deliverance; it is the condition for singing in advance.

Psalm 13 does not solve the problem of God’s hiddenness. It does something more modest and more audacious: it scripts how to speak when hiddenness is all one can see. The psalm moves from the pounding rhythm of עַד־אָנָה (ʿadh‑’Ā‑nāh) to the steadier cadence of אָשִׁירָה לַיהוָה. To pray it is to rehearse a shift many of us never make on our own: from “How long?” to “I will sing,” without waiting for the world to change.

  
## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

#### Full psalm

In Ashkenazic and Nusach Sefard rites, the entire Psalm 13 is recited in the expanded *Pesukei de‑Zimra* (Verses of Praise) on Shabbat and Festival mornings. It appears among a series of additional psalms inserted after the weekday core, so that the congregation, otherwise immersed in hymns of cosmic order and royal praise, briefly voices a stark personal lament:

> “עַד־אָ֣נָה יְהוָה תִּשְׁכָּחֵנִי נֶצַח… וַאֲנִי בְּחַסְדְּךָ בָטַחְתִּי…”  

The placement is suggestive: even on days defined by joy, the liturgy allows space for worshippers who feel forgotten. The psalm’s move from complaint to trust becomes a weekly rehearsal of spiritual resilience.

#### Key verses

The climax, Psalm 13:6,

> וַאֲנִי בְּחַסְדְּךָ בָטַחְתִּי; יָגֵל לִבִּי בִּישׁוּעָתֶךָ;  
> “But I, in Your steadfast love have trusted; my heart will rejoice in Your salvation,”  

is embedded in the weekday morning service across Ashkenaz, Sefard, and Edot ha‑Mizrach. It appears at the end of the *Hodu* section of *Pesukei de‑Zimra*, immediately after:  

> אַשְׁרֵי הָעָם שֶׁכָּכָה לוֹ; אַשְׁרֵי הָעָם שֶׁיְהוָה אֱלֹהָיו (Psalm 144:15).  

The sequence reads:

> “אַשְׁרֵי הָעָם… שֶׁיְהוָה אֱלֹהָיו.  
> וַאֲנִי בְּחַסְדְּךָ בָטַחְתִּי, יָגֵל לִבִּי בִּישׁוּעָתֶךָ.”  

“Happy is the people whose God is the LORD. But I, in Your steadfast love have trusted; my heart will rejoice in Your salvation.” The community’s general blessedness is immediately personalized as an “I” that still has to trust.

In the Edot ha‑Mizrach tradition for Rosh Hashanah, the entire verse is woven into the expanded *Pesukei de‑Zimra* on the Day of Judgment, again following אַשְׁרֵי הָעָם. On Yom Kippur it recurs during the Torah service as the scroll is taken from the ark, underscoring reliance on divine mercy when Israel stands most exposed.

#### Phrases

Verse 4’s phrase

> הָאִירָה עֵינַי פֶּן־אִישַׁן הַמָּוֶת  
> “Light up my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death”  

has entered the daily *Kriat Shema al ha‑Mitah* (Bedtime Shema). After asking for peaceful rest, the worshipper says:

> “וּתְהֵא מִטָּתִי שְׁלֵמָה לְפָנֶיךָ,  
> וְהָאֵר עֵינַי פֶּן אִישַׁן הַמָּוֶת.”  

“May my bed be whole before You, and light up my eyes lest I sleep the sleep of death.” The psalm’s extreme fear of dying under God’s hidden face becomes a nightly, almost gentle reminder of human fragility.

The opening cry עַד־אָנָה (“How long?”) is taken up in Sefardic *selichot* for the fast of the 20th of Sivan, a day of communal mourning. A piyyut laments persecution and pleads:

> “סִבְרָה הָרִשְׁעָה לְהָמִיר אֱמוּנַת הָאֵל הַיּוֹצֵר;  
> עַד אָנָה יְהוָה אֶקְרָא מִמֵּצַר.”  

“Wickedness thought to exchange the faith of the Creator God; how long, O LORD, shall I cry from the straits?” Here Psalm 13’s personal protest is harnessed to the memory of specific historical traumas.

The enemy clause of verse 5 is likewise re‑cast in that liturgy:  

> “צָרֵי יְהוּדָה יָגִילוּ כִּי אֶמּוֹט”—  
> “The foes of Judah will rejoice if I totter.”  

The original fear—“my foes will exult when I totter”—is put in national terms, turning the psalm into a script for a people on the verge of collapse.
