### Verse 1

**לַמְנַצֵּחַ מִזְמֹר לְדָוִד׃**  
“For the leader; a psalm of David.”

This little heading does more than just name the file.

לַמְנַצֵּחַ (*lamnatzēaḥ*) literally means “for the one who oversees / leads.” In the Psalms it’s a technical term for the **music director or choirmaster** in the Temple. We see the same root in 1 Chronicles 15:21, where certain Levites are appointed **לְנַצֵּחַ עַל־הַנְּגִינוֹת** — “to direct the music with harps.”

So from the start we know: whatever follows was meant to be sung **publicly**, not just whispered privately. This is already interesting. The content of Psalm 13 is brutally personal—“How long will You forget *me*?”—yet it’s handed to the choir. Ancient Israel is being taught to pray one person’s crisis together.

מִזְמֹר (*mizmor*) is the standard word for a psalm accompanied by plucked strings (probably something harp‑like). The phrase מִזְמֹר לְדָוִד can mean “a psalm *by* David” or “a psalm *belonging to* David / the Davidic collection.” For our purposes, the precise authorship matters less than the signal: this is a “Davidic‑style” prayer. Since David is Israel’s ideal king, his laments become model prayers for everyone.

Radak (Rabbi David Kimhi, a 13th‑century grammarian and commentator) reads the superscription this way:

> “זֶה הַמִּזְמוֹר אָמְרוֹ דָוִד בְּעֵת שֶׁהָיָה בְּצָרָה מֵאוֹיְבָיו, אוֹ נֶאֱמַר עַל לְשׁוֹן הַגָּלוּת; וְהוּא הַנָּכוֹן.”  
> “David said this psalm when he was in distress from his enemies, **or** it is spoken in the voice of the exile; and this latter is correct.”

In other words, starting from “a psalm of David” doesn’t lock it into David’s biography; it *opens* it up. Any generation in trouble can step into David’s words.

Finally, a small structural note: Psalm 21 begins with the exact same line, **לַמְנַצֵּחַ מִזְמֹר לְדָוִד**. Psalm 21 is a royal thanksgiving: “O LORD, in Your strength the king rejoices” (21:2). It’s a kind of “after” picture to Psalm 13’s “before.” The identical superscription quietly invites you to compare a king in crisis (Psalm 13) and a king in triumph (Psalm 21); both belong in the same liturgical world.

So in one short line we move from: private trouble → public song; David’s story → Israel’s story; this psalm → a small Davidic cluster (13, 21) about danger and deliverance.

### Verse 2

**עַד־אָ֣נָה יְהוָה תִּשְׁכָּחֵנִי נֶצַח;  
עַד־אָ֓נָה ׀ תַּסְתִּיר אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ מִמֶּנִּי׃**  

“How long, LORD, will You forget me forever?  
How long will You hide Your face from me?”

The first thing to notice is the double **עַד־אָנָה** (*ʿad anah*), “How long?” Repeating a phrase at the beginning of several lines like this is called **anaphora**—a poetic device where repetition builds intensity. Here the effect is like a drumbeat of frustration. And we’re only getting started; two more “How long?” lines follow in v.3.

The first complaint: תִּשְׁכָּחֵנִי (*tishkaḥēnî*)—“You forget me.” In everyday Hebrew, שָׁכַח just means “to forget,” but biblically, when God “remembers” or “forgets,” it’s about **acting (or not acting) on a relationship**:

- “וַיִּזְכֹּר אֱלֹהִים אֶת־בְּרִיתוֹ” — “God remembered His covenant” (Exod 2:24) and sent Moses.
- “עֶבְיוֹן לֹא יִשָּׁכַח לָנֶצַח” — “The needy shall not always be forgotten” (Ps 9:19) — implying that if they *are* “forgotten,” justice hasn’t happened yet.

Adding נֶצַח (*neṣaḥ*)—“forever / endlessly”—pushes the hyperbole: it *feels* like permanent abandonment. BDB notes that נֶצַח can mean “for a long time,” but emotionally, the speaker is at “this will never end.”

The second complaint intensifies the image: תַּסְתִּיר אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ (*tastîr et‑pāneikha*)—“You hide Your face.” As we saw in the intro, this idiom deliberately flips the priestly blessing:

> יָאֵר יְהוָה פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ — “May the LORD make His *face* shine upon you” (Num 6:25).

There, God’s shining face = favor and blessing. Here, a hidden face = perceived judgment or abandonment. Deuteronomy uses it as punishment language:

> “וְהִסְתַּרְתִּי פָנַי מֵהֶם… כִּי יִמָּצְאוּהוּ רָעוֹת רַבּוֹת”  
> “I will hide My face from them… and many evils will find them” (Deut 31:17).

Psalm 13 is daring because it takes that curse formula and applies it to someone who, as far as the psalm tells us, has *not* betrayed God. The theology the psalmist grew up with said: if God hides His face, you must have sinned. His experience says: “I haven’t, and yet Your face is gone.” He refuses to solve the problem by blaming himself or pretending everything’s fine; instead, he brings the contradiction to God.

Also note the vocative יְהוָה right in the middle—this is not abstract theory about “the divine”; it’s a direct address, like shouting someone’s name who won’t turn around.

### Verse 3

**עַד־אָ֨נָה אָשִׁית עֵצוֹת בְּנַפְשִׁי, יָגוֹן בִּלְבָבִי יוֹמָם;  
עַד־אָ֓נָה ׀ יָרוּם אֹיְבִי עָלָי׃**  

“How long must I set plans / thoughts in my *nefesh*,  
grief in my heart all day?  
How long will my enemy be exalted over me?”

We get our third and fourth **עַד־אָנָה**. The focus shifts inward (my *nefesh*, my heart) and outward (my enemy).

The phrase אָשִׁית עֵצוֹת בְּנַפְשִׁי (*ʾāšît ʿeṣot bənafshî*) is compact but rich. Literally: “I will set *ʿeṣot* in my *nefesh*.” Some unpacking:

- עֵצוֹת (*ʿeṣot*) – plural of עֵצָה, which covers ideas like “counsel, plan, scheme, thought, concern.” Context decides.
- נֶפֶשׁ (*nefesh*) here is “inner self / life,” not “soul” in the Greek sense.

Ibn Ezra hears frantic self‑strategy: “I think and set plans in my soul” — scrambling to figure out an escape route because no divine plan seems forthcoming. Metzudat David hears more like anxious rumination: “I set thoughts [about] how to escape from the grief that is in my heart all day.”

Either way, the key is **restlessness**. Instead of being led by God’s counsel—“בַעֲצָתְךָ תַּנְחֵנִי” (“By Your counsel You guide me,” Ps 73:24)—the psalmist is stuck looping through his own *ʿeṣot* and it doesn’t help.

יָגוֹן בִּלְבָבִי יוֹמָם – “grief in my heart *by day*.” יוֹמָם can mean “by day” as opposed to “by night,” or simply “all day long.” Meiri suggests a psychologically sharp reading: even during the day, when business normally distracts people from sadness, this psalmist can’t shake his grief. You could paraphrase: “I wake up sad, work sad, go to bed sad.”

The last colon pulls back to the social/political level: יָרוּם אֹיְבִי עָלָי — “my enemy is lifted up over me.” There’s no indication who this enemy is. It could be a personal foe, a national oppressor, or—even likely, given v.4—Death itself personified. The vagueness is deliberate: it makes the psalm reusable in many crises. The important thing is the **imbalance of power** the verb רוּם creates: the enemy is “up,” the speaker “down.”

Structurally, notice the concentric circles in vv.2–3:

- God’s absence (forgetting, hidden face)  
- Inner chaos (plans, grief)  
- Outer threat (enemy exalted)

The problem is total: theological, psychological, and social.

### Verse 4

**הַבִּיטָה, עֲנֵנִי יְהוָה אֱלֹהָי;  
הָאִירָה עֵינַי, פֶּן־אִישַׁן הַמָּוֶת׃**  

“Look, answer me, LORD my God!  
Make my eyes shine, lest I sleep the sleep of death.”

Here the psalmist stops describing and starts commanding. Three imperatives drive the line:

- **הַבִּיטָה** (*habbîtā*) – “Look!” from נבט, “to look attentively.” The Hiphil stem here (a verb pattern often meaning “cause to do X” or “do X intensively”) suggests not a casual glance but focused attention. It’s the reversal of “You hide Your face”; the speaker wants God’s gaze back on him.
- **עֲנֵנִי** (*ʿanēnî*) – “Answer me!” The root ענה in this sense presupposes a prior cry; silence now feels like intentional ignoring. And he frames it with the full covenant name: יְהוָה אֱלֹהָי (*Adonai Elohai*), “LORD, my God.” The possessive “my” insists on relationship even when it’s not felt.
- **הָאִירָה עֵינַי** (*hāʾîrā ʿênay*) – “Make my eyes shine.” The root אור (“to be light / to give light”) in Hiphil means “to cause to shine.” When applied to eyes, it refers to **restored vitality**, not getting new glasses. 1 Samuel 14:27: after Jonathan eats honey, “וַתָּאֹרְנָה עֵינָיו” — “his eyes brightened.” Ezra 9:8 uses a similar metaphor: God gives “light to our eyes” by reviving a battered community.

So the poet is saying, “Give me back the spark of life—spiritually, emotionally, physically.”

Then comes the motivation: פֶּן־אִישַׁן הַמָּוֶת — “lest I sleep the sleep of death.” The root ישׁן means “to sleep,” and as BDB notes, Biblical Hebrew often uses “sleep” as a polite or poetic way to say “die.” Jeremiah 51:39 describes Babylon’s downfall: “וְיָשְׁנוּ שְׁנַת עוֹלָם וְלֹא יִקִיצוּ” — “They will sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake up.”

Our verse pushes this softer metaphor and the ugly reality together: “sleep **of death**.” It’s as if to say, “I’m so drained that if You don’t re‑light my eyes, the sleep I’m about to slide into won’t have a morning.”

Liturgically, this line has had a surprisingly domestic afterlife. In the Bedtime Shema, we pray:

> וְהָאֵר עֵינַי פֶּן אִישַׁן הַמָּוֶת.  
> “Enlighten my eyes lest I sleep the sleep of death.”

So every night, Jews borrow Psalm 13’s extreme language to express a very everyday vulnerability: going to sleep and trusting God to wake you.

Poetically, verse 4 also quietly mirrors verse 2:

- v.2: **You hide Your face** (*תַּסְתִּיר אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ*) → my world goes dark.  
- v.4: **Make my eyes shine** (*הָאִירָה עֵינַי*) → bring back light.

Divine face and human eyes are linked in a kind of **chiasm**—a mirror‑pattern (A–B / B′–A′): hidden‑face / dark‑eyes → shining‑eyes / implied shining‑face.

### Verse 5

**פֶּן־יֹאמַר אֹיְבִי יְכׇלְתִּיו;  
צָרַי יָגִילוּ כִּי אֶמּוֹט׃**  

“Lest my enemy say, ‘I have prevailed over him’;  
my foes will exult when I totter.”

This verse explains the high stakes of God’s inaction.

First, the hypothetical enemy brag: פֶּן־יֹאמַר אֹיְבִי יְכׇלְתִּיו (*pen‑yōmar ʾoyvî yekhōltîv*)—“lest my enemy say, ‘I have prevailed over him.’” The verb יָכֹל can mean simply “to be able,” but in battle contexts it means “to win / overpower.” As mentioned in the intro, it has deep resonance from Jacob’s wrestling match:

> “וַיֹּאמֶר… כִּי־שָׂרִיתָ עִם־אֱלֹהִים וְעִם־אֲנָשִׁים וַתּוּכָל” —  
> “He said… ‘You have wrestled with God and with men and have **prevailed**’” (Gen 32:29).

So if the enemy can say “יְכׇלְתִּיו,” the implication is, “YHWH couldn’t protect His own; *I* could beat him.” It’s a miniature theology of victory.

Then the emotional scene: צָרַי יָגִילוּ כִּי אֶמּוֹט (*tsaray yagîlū kî ʾemmōṭ*) — “my foes will exult when I totter.” A couple of details:

- צָרַי (*tsaray*, “my foes”) is plural, from צַר (“adversary”). Malbim, always fond of fine distinctions, notes that an אֹיֵב (“enemy”) is one who *wants* to harm you, while a צַר is one who is *actively* causing trouble. So you get both the chief antagonist (singular אֹיְבִי) and the whole crowd of active harassers (plural צָרַי).
- יָגִילוּ (*yagîlū*) is from גיל, “to rejoice / exult.” This is not polite applause; think of fans storming the field because the other team finally fumbled.
- אֶמּוֹט (*ʾemmōṭ*) from מוֹט means “I totter / I am shaken.” Throughout Psalms, *not* being moved is a sign of security:  
  > “עֹשֵׂה־אֵלֶּה לֹא יִמּוֹט לְעוֹלָם” —  
  > “One who does these things shall never be shaken” (Ps 15:5).  
  Here we’re at the opposite pole: one step from collapse.

Notice the psychology: the psalmist isn’t only afraid of pain; he’s afraid of **shame**—of God’s apparent failure being used as a punchline by enemies. That’s why this isn’t just a private health scare; it’s a covenant issue. As Meiri hints, behind “I totter” stands “we”—Israel. If the people fall, the nations will say their God was powerless.

Also store away that verb יָגִילוּ. In the next verse, **the same root** will describe *the psalmist’s* heart. The joy doesn’t disappear; it changes owners.

### Verse 6

**וַאֲנִי בְּחַסְדְּךָ בָטַחְתִּי;  
יָגֵל לִבִּי בִּישׁוּעָתֶךָ;  
אָשִׁירָה לַיהוָה, כִּי גָמַל עָלָי׃**  

“But I, in Your steadfast love have trusted;  
my heart will exult in Your salvation.  
I will sing to the LORD, for He has dealt bountifully with me.”

This is the psalm’s shock cut. The circumstances haven’t changed on the page, but the *voice* has.

The opening וַאֲנִי (*vaʾanî*, “But I”) is a classic pivot. After all the “lest my enemy… my foes…” talk, the speaker asserts a different reality: whatever they do or say, “this is what *I* am doing.”

בְּחַסְדְּךָ בָטַחְתִּי — “In Your *ḥesed* I have trusted.” As before, *ḥesed* means God’s covenantal kindness/loyalty. The verb בָטַח (“to trust”) in the **perfect tense** (*bataḥtî*) suggests a completed, settled stance: “I have trusted (and still do).” It reaches back into the speaker’s history, not just a spur‑of‑the‑moment pep talk. Psalm 21:8 uses the same verb for the king:  

> “כִּי הַמֶּלֶךְ בֹּטֵחַ בַּיהוָה, וּבְחֶסֶד עֶלְיוֹן בַּל־יִמּוֹט” —  
> “For the king trusts in the LORD; through the *ḥesed* of the Most High he will not be moved.”

Our psalmist doesn’t *feel* very un‑moved (remember אֶמּוֹט in v.5), but he claims the same ground.

Next, the joy reversal: יָגֵל לִבִּי בִּישׁוּעָתֶךָ (*yāgēl libbî biyshuʿātekha*) — “my heart will exult in Your salvation.” Compare v.5: צָרַי יָגִילוּ כִּי אֶמּוֹט — “my foes exult when I totter.” The Psalm does elegant literary judo: the very *root* גיל, “to exult,” is transferred from enemies to the psalmist’s heart.

Note also the future sense here (“will exult”) versus the past sense of בָטַחְתִּי (“I have trusted”). Trust is anchored in past dealings; joy is projected into the future *when* salvation arrives. The psalmist lets that future joy “leak” back into the present as anticipation.

אָשִׁירָה לַיהוָה — “I will sing to the LORD.” This is not yet a report of singing; it’s a resolve. In Hebrew the form אָשִׁירָה can be both 1st person future and a kind of gentle **cohortative** (a verb form expressing “let me / I am determined to…”). Either way, song is being pledged *before* any narrated rescue. That’s crucial: praise here is an act of faith, not merely a reaction.

Finally, כִּי גָמַל עָלָי — “for He has dealt bountifully with me.” As we discussed above, גמל carries the idea of **dealing fully / rewarding / doing good**. Is this a memory of past rescues or a statement about the future stated as if already done—a **prophetic perfect**? Probably both. The psalmist’s logic often works like this: “You *have* been this kind of God to me/us; therefore I can speak of Your future help as already real.”

BDB notes that גמל is used for positive dealing in Psalms 116:7 (“for the LORD has dealt bountifully with you”) and neutral/negative dealing in 103:10 (“He has not dealt with us according to our sins”). Here it clearly leans positive; the LXX even paraphrases, “ὁ εὐεργετήσας με” — “the One who has done good to me.”

Liturgically, we underline this confidence by putting the verse on our lips **every morning** right after “Happy is the people whose God is the LORD.” It’s as if the siddur says: community theology is nice, but at some point you have to say, very personally, “But *I* have trusted… my heart will rejoice… I will sing… for He has dealt bountifully with *me*.”

So Psalm 13 doesn’t solve the problem of divine hiddenness; God’s face is still unseen. What it does is model a way of speaking—moving from “How long?” to “But I will sing”—that lets complaint and confidence live in the same prayer.
