# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 126

The existing introduction and commentary are already thoughtful: they identify the psalm’s temporal ambiguity, trace its shift from thanksgiving to petition to proverb, and handle the Negev / sowing imagery with real sensitivity. Medieval commentators are used well, and there is some attention to liturgy and modern reception.

What’s missing is the full use of the “deep web” material you’ve assembled. Several genuine “aha” opportunities are left on the table:

- The alternative etymology of כְּחֹלְמִים (*k’cholmim*) from חָלַם II (“be healthy”), and its potential pairing with the Negev streams imagery, deserves sustained treatment.
- The Ugaritic Baal cycle’s chain of “dream – sowing – flowing wadis” is noted but not really exploited to show how Psalm 126 demythologizes a Canaanite pattern.
- Rabbinic reception is only partially used. The Honi ha-Me’agel story (Ta’anit 23a) and the Talmudic re-reading of “אָז יִמָּלֵא שְׂחוֹק פִּינוּ” (*az yimale s’choq pinu*, “then our mouth will be filled with laughter,” Berakhot 31a) are too rich to omit.
- Zionist and Christian receptions (Slucki’s *Shivat Zion*, “Bringing in the Sheaves,” Brahms’ *Requiem*) can be better integrated to show how the agricultural metaphor has been repeatedly re-planted in new soils.

Technically, some Hebrew citations in the current material lack parallel English, and terms like *ketiv/qere* and “prophetic perfect” are used without definition. The revised version should correct those, weave in the ANE parallels and reception history more tightly, and make the psalm’s literary artistry visible without presuming specialist training.
