“When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like dreamers”: שִׁ֗יר הַמַּ֫עֲל֥וֹת בְּשׁ֣וּב יְהוָ֣ה אֶת־שִׁיבַ֣ת צִיּ֑וֹן; הָ֝יִ֗ינוּ כְּחֹלְמִֽים׃  
“A song of ascents. When YHWH restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like dreamers” (Psalm 126:1).

For many Jews this line is not first encountered on parchment but at a table: sung before *Birkat HaMazon* on Shabbat or at the Passover Seder, just when bodies are full and history feels close. It is an odd moment for a dream—hands sticky with wine, children drowsing in their chairs—and yet the psalm insists: redemption, when it comes, will feel unreal.

#### Time out of joint

From its first word, the psalm destabilizes time. The phrase בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה (*b’shuv YHWH*) can mean “when YHWH restored” (past) or “when YHWH restores” (future). Hebrew often uses a past tense to describe a certain future, what grammarians call a “prophetic perfect”: the future so sure it can be narrated as memory. Medieval commentators pulled in different directions.  

Rashi hears an unfulfilled promise and reads the verse as future perfect: when God will restore us, we will look back and say that our long exile was like a fleeting dream. Ibn Ezra, rationalist and grammarian, anchors the line to 538 BCE, the Persian decree that sent exiles back from Babylon. Radak tries to have both: yes, the psalm remembers that historical return, but verse 4’s plea—שׁוּבָה יְהוָה אֶת־שְׁבִיתֵנוּ, “Restore our fortunes, O YHWH”—shows that even after coming home they were still, in some sense, captive.

The noun at the heart of that opening line is itself double. The Masoretic pointing gives שִׁיבַת צִיּוֹן (*shivat Tzion*), “the return of Zion,” from the root שׁוּב (*shuv*, return). But a parallel form, שְׁבוּת (*sh’vut*), from שָׁבָה (*shavah*, take captive), lies just beneath the surface. Elsewhere the stock phrase שׁוּב שְׁבוּת (*shuv sh’vut*) means “restore the fortunes / reverse the captivity,” as in Job 42:10, וַיהוָה שָׁב אֶת־שְׁבוּת אִיּוֹב (“YHWH restored Job’s fortunes”). Our psalm deliberately sits on that seam. What God reverses is both a geography and a condition: people go home, and fate itself is turned inside out.

Modern historians complicate the story further. Judah was never an entirely empty land; many farmers stayed through the Babylonian period. Yet the psalm speaks of “the return of Zion” as though history has been reset. It gives language to the *gôlah*—the returning elite—for whom coming back does not simply add a layer to the past but overwrites it. “Shivat Tzion” is already an ideology as much as a description.

#### Dreamers—or convalescents?

The simile הָיִינוּ כְּחֹלְמִים (*hayinu k’cholmim*), “we were like dreamers,” seems straightforward: the restoration was so astonishing it felt unreal. Elsewhere a dream marks the insubstantial: “Like a dream after waking, O Lord, when You rouse Yourself, You despise their image” (כַּחֲלוֹם מֵהָקִיץ… תִּבְזֶה, Psalm 73:20). Here, too, the experience of deliverance is like that moment when nocturnal images still cling to the mind.

But philology suggests another, more bodily nuance. In Job 39:4 we read of wild animals, בְּנֵיהֶם יַחְלְמוּ (“their young ones grow strong”): *yachlemu* there does not mean “they dream,” but “they thrive, become healthy.” A related form in Isaiah 38:16 has the sense “restore me to health.” On this basis N. H. Tur-Sinai and others have proposed that חֹלְמִים (*cholmim*) in our psalm may echo this second root: “we were like those restored to health.”

The exile, then, is not only a nightmare from which one wakes but an illness. Zion is not merely re-entered; it is the sanatorium in which a wasted body fills out again. That reading suddenly aligns verse 1 with verse 4’s desert hydrology: שׁוּבָה יְהוָה אֶת־שְׁבִיתֵנוּ; כַּאֲפִיקִים בַּנֶּגֶב (“Restore our fortunes, O YHWH, like watercourses in the Negev”). The community in ruins and the land in drought are two faces of the same desiccation; both are waiting to be “re-hydrated.”

The rabbis, for their part, seized on the dream. The Babylonian Talmud (Ta’anit 23a) tells of Honi ha-Me’agel, troubled by our verse: “שִׁיר הַמַּעֲלוֹת בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה אֶת שִׁיבַת צִיּוֹן הָיִינוּ כְּחֹלְמִים—‘A Song of Ascents. When YHWH restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like dreamers.’ Is it possible,” Honi asks, “for a person to dream for seventy years?” He then falls asleep for precisely seventy years while a carob tree grows. Waking to a world in which no one knows him, Honi dies in alienation. The story literalizes the “seventy-year dream” of exile only to expose its cost: when history restarts, you may find yourself a stranger in your own redemption.

#### From spectators to participants

The first half of the psalm (vv. 1–3) reads like a thanksgiving scene remembered—or foreseen. Laughter and song spill out of bodies almost against their will: אָ֤ז יִמָּלֵ֪א שְׂח֡וֹק פִּינוּ֮; וּלְשׁוֹנֵ֢נוּ רִ֫נָּ֥ה (“Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with ringing shout,” v. 2). The verb יִמָּלֵא (*yimmalē’*, “will be filled”) imagines mouth and tongue as vessels suddenly brimful.  

Against this exuberance the psalm stages an interesting exchange of voices. The nations look on and say, הִגְדִּ֥יל יְהוָ֗ה לַעֲשׂ֥וֹת עִם־אֵלֶּה (“YHWH has done great things with these,” v. 2). Israel then repeats their words with a tiny but momentous edit: הִגְדִּ֣יל יְ֭הוָה לַעֲשׂ֥וֹת עִמָּ֗נוּ; הָיִ֥ינוּ שְׂמֵחִֽים׃ (“YHWH has done great things with us; we were joyful,” v. 3). Verbatim repetition with a pronoun shift—from “them” to “us”—turns external astonishment into internal testimony. Malbim, a 19th‑century commentator, reads this as a difference in vantage point: the nations marvel at geopolitical improbability; Israel tastes covenantal fidelity.

Yet just when the narrative seems to settle into satisfied memory, verse 4 jerks us into petition: שׁוּבָה יְהוָה אֶת־שְׁבִיתֵנוּ (“Restore our fortunes, O YHWH”). The grammar swings from perfect (“He has done great things”) to imperative (“Do it!”), from talking about God to talking to God. The effect is to reveal that the earlier “restoration” is either incomplete or liturgically projected into the future. The community has tasted something, but it is not finished.

The simile that completes verse 4 sharpens this request: כַּאֲפִיקִים בַּנֶּגֶב (“like watercourses in the Negev”). The *afikim* are not gentle streams; they are desert wadis, usually dusty scars in the landscape. In the rainy season, sudden downpours in the Judean hills send torrents roaring through them, transforming a parched expanse in a matter of hours. That is the kind of restoration the psalm begs for—not slow improvement but flash‑flood grace. The Talmud (Ta’anit 8b) collapses metaphor and reality: “Great is the day of rain, like the day of the ingathering of exiles, as it is said, ‘Restore our fortunes, O YHWH, like watercourses in the Negev.’” Rain *is* redemption.

#### Sowing in tears

The closing distichs (vv. 5–6) shift register again, from communal plea to proverbial wisdom:

הַזֹּרְעִ֥ים בְּדִמְעָ֗ה; בְּרִנָּ֥ה יִקְצֹֽרוּ׃  
“They who sow in tears shall reap with ringing shout” (v. 5).

הָ֘ל֤וֹךְ יֵלֵ֨ךְ ׀ וּבָכֹה֮ נֹשֵׂ֪א מֶֽשֶׁךְ־הַ֫זָּ֥רַע; בֹּֽא־יָבֹ֥א בְרִנָּ֑ה; נֹ֝שֵׂ֗א אֲלֻמֹּתָֽיו׃  
“Though he goes, he goes and weeps, bearing the measure of seed, he shall surely come with ringing shout, bearing his sheaves” (v. 6).

Here the psalm universalizes its particular history into an agricultural law of spiritual physics. Post‑exilic Judah was a subsistence economy; Haggai scolds, “You have sown much, and brought in little; you eat but are not satisfied” (זְרַעְתֶּם הַרְבֵּה וְהָבֵא מְעָט; חַגַּי 1:6). Seed is not an expendable metaphor; it is tomorrow’s bread. To carry a seed-bag into a marginal, drought‑prone field is to gamble your children’s rations on the sky’s goodwill. Little wonder the sower “goes and weeps,” afraid that nothing will sprout.

The rare phrase מֶשֶׁךְ־הַזָּרַע (*meshekh ha‑zara‘*) is evocatively obscure. It may be the “trail of seed” that falls from his hand, or the “bag of seed” he carries. Either way, it suggests measured scarcity, not abundance: there is only so much you can risk. What he carries back, by contrast, are אֲלֻמֹּתָיו (*alumotav*), “his sheaves”—a word that rings with an earlier dream: Joseph’s vision of his brothers’ sheaves bowing to his (Genesis 37:7). In Psalm 126, the dream of impossible exaltation reappears as the utterly prosaic fantasy of enough grain.

The Ugaritic Baal cycle offers a striking mythic backdrop. There, a dying god is “sown” in the earth and after a dream the wadis run with honey. Psalm 126 knows the pattern of “dream → sowing → flowing streams,” but empties it of gods. There is no Baal, only farmers; no sacred drama of death and resurrection, only the risky work of a people who trust that YHWH honors tears.

The verse’s Hebrew intensifies this rhythm. The construction הָלוֹךְ יֵלֵךְ / בֹּא יָבֹא (“going he goes… coming he comes”) is called an infinitive absolute: repeating the verb to emphasize duration and certainty. The man keeps trudging out, weeping; yet the line’s music already contains his return. The one thing that does not change is נֹשֵׂא (*nose’*, “bearing”): he always carries something. What shifts is content—from scarce seed to overflowing sheaves.

#### A psalm that refuses closure

Rabbinic tradition took the psalm’s deferral seriously. Berakhot 31a rules: “It is forbidden for a person to fill his mouth with laughter in this world, as it is said, אָז יִמָּלֵא שְׂחוֹק פִּינוּ (‘then our mouth will be filled with laughter’).” Unrestrained joy belongs to the “then” of verse 2, not the “now” of a world still sowing in tears. The Sephardic *Vidui ha‑Gadol* for Yom Kippur even turns the line against us: מִלֵּאנוּ שְׂחוֹק פִּינוּ בָעוֹלָם הַזֶּה—“We filled our mouths with laughter in this world,” a confession of having treated the incomplete as if it were final.

Modern Zionism, by contrast, read Psalm 126 with bracing literalism. Abraham Jacob Slucki titled his 1891 anthology of rabbinic pro‑settlement voices *Shivat Tzion* after our opening phrase, and early pioneers took “sowing in tears” as a call to actual agriculture. In the pre‑state debate over a national anthem, some lobbied for this very psalm—set to a popular melody—as a kind of sacred *Hatikvah*. In Protestant America, Knowles Shaw’s hymn “Bringing in the Sheaves” re-planted verses 5–6 in evangelical soil: now the “seed” is kindness or gospel preaching, and the “sheaves” are saved souls. Johannes Brahms opened his *German Requiem* with the same lines in German, using orchestration to move from the dark trudging of sowing to the luminous swell of harvest.

Across these wildly different appropriations, something constant emerges. Psalm 126 refuses to let joy and pain separate cleanly. It sanctifies the interval—the seventy-year dream, the flash‑flood hope, the tearful furrows—as the place where faith lives. Every recitation of “שׁוּבָה יְהוָה אֶת־שְׁבִיתֵנוּ” (“Restore our fortunes, O YHWH”) is spoken by people who have already, in some sense, come home and yet remain, just as truly, on the road; who walk out into fragile fields with small bags of seed, and trust that one day, coming home with sheaves will feel less like a dream.

---LITURGICAL-SECTION-START---

#### Full psalm

Psalm 126 is recited in full as *Shir HaMa‘alot* before *Birkat HaMazon* (Grace after Meals) on Shabbat, festivals, and joyous occasions in Ashkenazic and Sephardic rites. The table version begins:

שִׁיר הַמַּעֲלוֹת; בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה אֶת־שִׁיבַת צִיּוֹן; הָיִינוּ כְּחֹלְמִים׃  
“Song of Ascents. When YHWH restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like dreamers.”

Placed immediately before the blessings for food, the psalm reframes the meal as a foretaste of redemption: the “sheaves” of verses 5–6 become the bread just eaten; the joy of the table anticipates the laughter “then” when exile is fully reversed. At the Passover Seder, this same recitation in the *Barech* section explicitly links the exodus from Egypt to the future “return of Zion.”

In many communities, during the winter months Psalm 126 is also included in the chain of fifteen *Shir HaMa‘alot* (Psalms 120–134) recited after Shabbat Mincha, marking the day’s descent with a meditation on return and harvest.

In the Edot HaMizrach tradition, the full psalm appears in *Tikkun Leah*, the consolatory half of the midnight *Tikkun Chatzot*. There it is chanted after laments for the destroyed Temple, its opening “When YHWH restored…” sung precisely in the hour that remembers what has not yet been restored.

#### Key verses

**Psalm 126:5–6** – הַזֹּרְעִ֥ים בְּדִמְעָ֗ה; בְּרִנָּ֥ה יִקְצֹֽרוּ׃ הָ֘ל֤וֹךְ יֵלֵ֨ךְ ׀ וּבָכֹה֮ נֹשֵׂ֪א מֶשֶׁךְ־הַ֫זָּ֥רַע; בֹּֽא־יָבֹ֥א בְרִנָּ֑ה; נֹ֝שֵׂ֗א אֲלֻמֹּתָֽיו׃  
“Those who sow in tears shall reap with ringing shout. Though he goes, he goes and weeps, bearing the measure of seed, he shall surely come with ringing shout, bearing his sheaves.”

These verses are encountered liturgically wherever the whole psalm is recited. In the Passover Haggadah, they stand just before the table’s grace, so that the gathered family “sowing” generations of memory can imagine themselves returning with sheaves. In the Edot HaMizrach *Birkat ha-Ilanot* (Blessing of the Trees in Nisan), Psalm 126 is recited before the main benediction over blossoming fruit trees. The sight of trees in bud is framed by “Those who sow in tears shall reap with songs of joy,” reading the agricultural cycle as a sign of cosmic and national restoration.

#### Phrases

**וּלְשׁוֹנֵנוּ רִנָּה – “and our tongue with ringing shout” (v. 2)**  

In the Shabbat *Nishmat Kol Chai* prayer, this fragment is woven into a baroque catalogue of imagined praise:

וְאִלּוּ פִינוּ מָלֵא שִׁירָה כַּיָּם; וּלְשׁוֹנֵנוּ רִנָּה כַּהֲמוֹן גַּלָּיו… אֵין אֲנַחְנוּ מַסְפִּיקִים לְהוֹדוֹת לְךָ יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ  
“Were our mouth filled with song as the sea, and our tongue with ringing shout as the multitude of its waves… we would still be unable to thank You, YHWH our God.”

Here the psalm’s spontaneous joy becomes an argument for human inadequacy: even if our tongues rang like that, it would not suffice.

**אָז יִמָּלֵא שְׂחוֹק פִּינוּ – “then our mouth will be filled with laughter” (v. 2)**  

The Yom Kippur *Vidui ha-Gadol* of Rabbeinu Nissim, in the Edot HaMizrach rite, turns this promise into confession:

מִלֵּאנוּ שְׂחוֹק פִּינוּ בָּעוֹלָם הַזֶּה; נִאַצְנוּ, נִאַפְנוּ…  
“We filled our mouth with laughter in this world; we have spurned, we have acted immorally…”

Laughing “now” instead of “then” becomes a way of naming misplaced levity in an unredeemed world.

**אָז יֹאמְרוּ בַגּוֹיִם הִגְדִּיל יְהוָה לַעֲשׂוֹת עִם־אֵלֶּה – “Then they will say among the nations, ‘YHWH has done great things with these’” (v. 2)**  

In the Edot HaMizrach custom of *Seder Korban ha-Nesi’im* (the daily reading about the tribal princes’ offerings in Nisan), a *Yehi Ratzon* prayer ends with this line:

יֵרְאוּ שׂוֹנְאֵינוּ וְיֵבֹשׁוּ… כִּי אַתָּה יְהוָה עֲזַרְתָּנוּ וְנִחַמְתָּנוּ. אָז יֹאמְרוּ בַגּוֹיִם הִגְדִּיל יְהוָה לַעֲשׂוֹת עִם־אֵלֶּה׃  
“May our enemies see and be ashamed… for You, YHWH, have helped us and comforted us. Then they will say among the nations, ‘YHWH has done great things with these.’”

The original past testimony is here re-voiced as a future hope that the final redemption will be internationally visible.

**פִּינוּ וּלְשׁוֹנֵנוּ – “our mouth and our tongue” (v. 2)**  

A morning meditation in some Edot HaMizrach siddurim asks for guarded speech on Shabbat:

וְלִשְׁמוֹר פִּינוּ וּלְשׁוֹנֵנוּ שֶׁלֹּא נְדַבֵּר בַּשַּׁבָּת דִּבּוּר שֶׁל חוֹל וְשׁוּם דִּבּוּר אָסוּר  
“And to guard our mouth and our tongue, that we not speak on Shabbat speech of weekday, nor any forbidden speech.”

The pairing of “mouth” and “tongue” from Psalm 126 is repurposed for ethical discipline: the very instruments once “filled” with laughter and song must now be restrained.
