#### What’s this psalm actually about?

Psalm 126 opens with one of the most haunting lines in the Psalms:

> שִׁ֗יר הַמַּ֫עֲל֥וֹת בְּשׁ֣וּב יְהוָה אֶת־שִׁיבַ֣ת צִיּ֑וֹן;  
> הָ֝יִ֗ינוּ כְּחֹלְמִֽים׃  
> *“A Song of Ascents. When YHWH restored the fortunes of Zion,  
> we were like dreamers.”*

Already you have several questions:

- *“When”* did this happen—past, present, or future?
- What exactly is *“שִׁיבַת צִיּוֹן”* (*shivat Tziyon*)—“the return of Zion,” “the captivity of Zion,” “the fortunes of Zion”?
- And what does it mean to be *“כְּחֹלְמִים”* (*k’cholmim*)—“like dreamers”?

The superscription *שִׁיר הַמַּעֲלוֹת* (*shir ha‑ma‘alot*, “Song of Ascents”) tells you this psalm belongs to the little collection Psalms 120–134, probably used by pilgrims “going up” to Jerusalem or by Levites on the Temple steps. So imagine a group of travelers singing this together on the road up to Zion.

Historically, many readers hear verse 1 as referring to the end of the Babylonian exile, when some Judeans returned to Jerusalem around 538 BCE. God “turned things around” for Zion—and the people were stunned. The Hebrew *בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה* (*b’shuv YHWH*) can mean “when YHWH **restored**” in the past, but its form also allows “when YHWH **restores**” as a future scenario. The poet keeps it deliberately slippery. That lets the line work in three tenses at once:

- remembering a past deliverance,
- describing a hoped‑for future,
- and speaking into the singer’s messy present.

The noun *שִׁיבַת* (*shivat*) also carries a double meaning. Pointed one way, it looks like a noun from the root שׁ־ו־ב (“to return”): *“the return of Zion.”* Pointed another way, as *שְׁבוּת* (*sh’vut*), it comes from שׁ־ב־ה (“to take captive”) and in biblical idiom *שׁוּב שְׁבוּת* (*shuv sh’vut*) means “to restore fortunes / reverse captivity.” The psalm quietly holds both ideas: God brings people physically back and also reverses their whole situation.

Then *“הָיִינוּ כְּחֹלְמִים”*—“we were like dreamers.” Most readers connect this to the usual root חָלַם (“to dream”). The return felt too good to be true, like waking up into a happy dream after a long nightmare. Rabbinic tradition loved that. The Talmud (Ta‘anit 23a) tells the story of חוֹנִי הַמְעַגֵּל (*Honi ha‑Me‘aggel*, Honi the Circle‑Maker), who puzzled over this verse: “Can a person dream for seventy years?” In the story he quite literally falls asleep for seventy years—the length of the exile—and wakes up in a totally changed world. For Honi, the “dream” of restoration is disorienting as well as joyful.

A minority of scholars, noticing related words in Aramaic and Syriac, suggest a different root חָלַם (“to be strong, healthy”). Then *“הָיִינוּ כְּחֹלְמִים”* could mean “we were like people restored to health.” Exile is like an illness; coming home is like getting your strength back. That fits nicely with verse 4’s image of dry riverbeds suddenly filled with water.

You don’t have to pick one meaning and throw the other away. The point is the intensity of the reversal. Whether you imagine the fogginess of waking from a dream or the weakness of recovering from illness, verse 1 says: when God turns history around, normal categories—“Is this real? Am I okay?”—don’t quite work.

#### The structure: how the poem argues

Psalm 126 is short—only six verses—but it shifts gears twice in ways worth noticing.

**1. Verses 1–3: Remembered (or imagined) restoration**

> אָ֤ז יִמָּלֵ֪א שְׂח֡וֹק פִּינוּ֮ וּלְשׁוֹנֵ֢נוּ רִ֫נָּ֥ה;  
> אָ֭ז יֹאמְר֣וּ בַגּוֹיִ֑ם: הִגְדִּ֥יל יְ֝הוָה לַעֲשׂ֥וֹת עִם־אֵֽלֶּה׃  
> הִגְדִּ֣יל יְהוָ֣ה לַעֲשׂ֣וֹת עִמָּ֑נוּ;  
> הָיִ֥ינוּ שְׂמֵחִֽים׃  
> *“Then our mouth was filled with laughter,  
> and our tongue with joyful song.  
> Then they said among the nations,  
> ‘YHWH has done great things for them.’  
> YHWH has done great things for us;  
> we were rejoicing.”*

The double *אָז* (*az*, “then”) in verse 2 works like a drumbeat: **then** our mouths, **then** the nations. The imagery is delightfully physical: laughter (*שְׂחוֹק*, *s’choq*) fills the mouth; *רִנָּה* (*rinah*)—a ringing shout of joy—fills the tongue.

Then something clever happens. In verse 2, the nations say:

- *“הִגְדִּיל יְהוָה לַעֲשׂוֹת עִם־אֵלֶּה”* – “YHWH has done great things **with them**.”

In verse 3, Israel simply repeats the line but switches the pronoun:

- *“הִגְדִּיל יְהוָה לַעֲשׂוֹת עִמָּנוּ”* – “YHWH has done great things **with us**.”

Same verb (*הִגְדִּיל… לַעֲשׂוֹת*, “has done great things”), same word order—just moving from “them” to “us.” It’s like hearing someone admire your life from the outside and then saying, “Yes. That’s actually my story.” The psalm models how a community internalizes its own miracle.

Notice also the tenses: *הָיִינוּ* (*hayinu*, “we were”) and the perfect *הִגְדִּיל* (“has done”) sound like completed past actions. If the psalm stopped at verse 3, you’d have a neat little thanksgiving song about a finished salvation.

**2. Verse 4: Sudden petition**

It doesn’t stop.

> שׁוּבָ֣ה יְהוָ֣ה אֶת־שְׁבִיתֵ֑נוּ;  
> כַּאֲפִיקִ֥ים בַּנֶּֽגֶב׃  
> *“Restore, YHWH, our fortunes,  
> like watercourses in the Negev.”*

The mood flips. *שׁוּבָה* (*shuvah*) is an imperative—“Restore!” So even after all the past‑tense joy, the community still needs help now. That’s the heart of this psalm: holding memory of what God “has done” together with the ache of what God has *not yet* done.

The image is precise. *כַּאֲפִיקִים בַּנֶּגֶב* (*ka’afikim ba‑Negev*) refers to the dry riverbeds—wadis—in Israel’s southern desert. For most of the year they’re bare channels of dust. Then, after heavy rains up north, they can suddenly roar with flash floods, transforming the landscape in hours. The poet does **not** pray, “Restore us like a slow drip‑irrigation system.” The community asks for a dramatic, life‑changing rush.

**3. Verses 5–6: A wisdom‑style promise**

> הַזֹּרְעִ֥ים בְּדִמְעָ֗ה;  
> בְּרִנָּ֥ה יִקְצֹֽרוּ׃  
> הָ֘ל֤וֹךְ יֵלֵ֨ךְ ׀ וּבָכֹה֮ נֹשֵׂ֪א מֶֽשֶׁךְ־הַ֫זָּ֥רַע;  
> בֹּֽא־יָבֹ֥א בְרִנָּ֑ה;  
> נֹ֝שֵׂ֗א אֲלֻמֹּתָֽיו׃  
> *“Those who sow in tears  
> will reap with joyful song.  
> One goes along weeping,  
> carrying the measure of seed;  
> he will surely come with joyful song,  
> carrying his sheaves.”*

Here the psalm sounds like the book of Proverbs. It switches from “we” and “our” to a general rule: this is how the world, under God, tends to work. Sowing and reaping, tears and joy, going out and coming back.

The context matters. In a fragile, rain‑dependent farming economy, *הַזֹּרְעִים בְּדִמְעָה* (*ha‑zor‘im b’dim‘ah*, “those who sow in tears”) is not just a poetic way to say “sad people.” Seed was the family’s food. To plant it in dry soil was a terrifying gamble: if the rains fail, the seed dies in the ground and so might your children. Verse 6 zooms in on one farmer: *“הָלוֹךְ יֵלֵךְ וּבָכֹה”* (*halokh yelekh u‑vakho*, “going he goes and weeping”), carrying *מֶשֶׁךְ הַזָּרַע* (*meshekh ha‑zara‘*), probably “the bag” or “the small measure of seed.” When he returns, he carries *אֲלֻמֹּתָיו* (*alumotav*), “his sheaves”—far more than he planted.

So the psalm ends not with a description of something that already happened, but with a pattern and a promise: in God’s economy, risky, painful obedience is not wasted. Tears are not the last word.

#### Why this psalm still matters

Because Psalm 126 is so compact and so theologically “flexible,” Jewish and Christian traditions have reused it in wildly different ways.

- The rabbis tell the story of Honi to ask: what does it feel like when your world changes while you “sleep” through exile?
- Jewish liturgy puts this psalm before *Birkat HaMazon* (Grace After Meals) on Shabbat and festivals. Every festive meal rehearses: “We are people who have seen reversals. Our full table now is a tiny preview of *‘then our mouth will be filled with laughter’.*”
- Medieval mystics read *“שִׁיבַת צִיּוֹן”* as the exile of the *Shekhinah* (Divine Presence) and the “sheaves” as scattered sparks of holiness. Eating becomes “sowing,” and every mitzvah is part of gathering in the harvest of redemption.
- Early Zionist writers (late 19th century) titled collections *שיבת ציון* (*Shivat Tzion*, “Return of Zion”) and took the sowing image literally: buy land, plant vines, drain swamps. Redemption meant actual agriculture.
- In Christian tradition, verses 5–6 appear in funeral liturgies and in Brahms’s *Ein deutsches Requiem*, where “Those who sow in tears” comforts mourners that grief now will give way to joy.
- A 19th‑century American gospel song, “Bringing in the Sheaves,” rewired the metaphor so the “seed” becomes acts of kindness or preaching, and the “sheaves” are people brought to faith.

Under all these layers, the psalm keeps doing the same thing: it refuses to separate memory, pain, and hope. It teaches a way of standing in the middle of history—sowing with tears in dry ground—while still singing about the sheaves you haven’t seen yet.

For you as readers of biblical poetry, Psalm 126 is a great laboratory. In six verses you can watch Hebrew grammar creating temporal ambiguity, images doing heavy theological work, and later communities arguing with and re‑inhabiting the text. It’s a little poem with a very long afterlife.

---LITURGICAL-SECTION-START---

#### Full psalm

In most Ashkenazi and many Sephardi communities, Psalm 126 is sung in full as the introduction to *Birkat HaMazon* (Grace After Meals) on Shabbat, festivals, and at joyous meals like weddings.

The idea is simple: before thanking God for the particular meal, you step back and remember the bigger “meal”—God’s feeding, restoring, and bringing Israel home. On ordinary weekdays some communities instead recite Psalm 137 (“By the rivers of Babylon”), a lament over exile. On Shabbat and holidays, Psalm 126 flips the tone from mourning to joy and hope.

Because it’s used so often, many people know it by heart as *“Shir HaMa‘alot, b’shuv Adonai…”* without necessarily thinking about its words. Part of our task is to slow it down again.

#### Key verses

One line from verse 2 is woven into a major Shabbat and festival prayer:

> וּלְשׁוֹנֵ֢נוּ רִ֫נָּ֥ה – *“and our tongue [was filled] with joyful song”* (Psalm 126:2)

In the Shabbat *Nishmat Kol Chai* (“The breath of all that lives”) prayer, this becomes:

> וְאִלּוּ פִינוּ מָלֵא שִׁירָה כַיָּם,  
> **וּלְשׁוֹנֵנוּ רִנָּה כַּהֲמוֹן גַּלָּיו**…  
> *“Were our mouth as full of song as the sea,  
> and our tongue with joyful song like its many waves…”*

Here the psalm’s line, which originally described shock at national restoration, is turned into a hyperbole about how inadequate human praise is. Even if our mouths and tongues were maxed‑out with song, it still wouldn’t be enough.

Verses 5–6 are also recited in various Sephardi rites during *Tikkun Chatzot* (a midnight devotional lament over the Temple’s destruction) and during *Birkat Ha’Ilanot* (the blessing over blossoming fruit trees in the month of Nisan). The words

> הַזֹּרְעִ֥ים בְּדִמְעָ֗ה; בְּרִנָּ֥ה יִקְצֹֽרוּ׃  
> *“Those who sow in tears will reap with joyful song”*

are spoken while looking at new blossoms—very literally “sowing and reaping”—and at the same time asking for the “harvest” of redemption.

#### Phrases

Sometimes single phrases from the psalm get repurposed in surprising ways.

From verse 2:

> מָלֵא שְׂחוֹק פִּינוּ – *“our mouth was filled with laughter”*

In a Yom Kippur confession called *Vidui HaGadol* (“The Great Confession”), used in some Eastern communities, this becomes a sin:

> מִלֵּאנוּ שְׂחוֹק פִּינוּ בָּעוֹלָם הַזֶּה – *“We filled our mouths with laughter in this world”*

Here the issue is not joy itself, but wasting one’s life on trivial laughter instead of serious repair.

In other prayers, people ask God:

> לִשְׁמוֹר פִינוּ וּלְשׁוֹנֵנוּ – *“to guard our mouth and our tongue”*

echoing *“our mouth…our tongue”* in Psalm 126:2, but now about self‑control in speech, especially on Shabbat.

Liturgically, then, Psalm 126 is not just a historical memory. It’s a toolbox of images and phrases that get reused to talk about praise, repentance, nature, exile, and redemption—exactly the kind of afterlife a good poem wants.
