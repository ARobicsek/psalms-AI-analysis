      "What is the rhetorical and theological effect of the shift from 'them' (אֵלֶּה, v.2) to 'us' (עִמָּנוּ, v.3), and does this suggest quotation-then-appropriation structure?",

      "How does the agricultural metaphor relate to exilic/post-exilic theology—is there wordplay between זֶרַע (seed) and זֶרַע (offspring/descendants), connecting sowing to national restoration?",
      "What is the precise function and emphasis of the intensive verbal constructions (absolute infinitive) הָלוֹךְ יֵלֵךְ and בֹּא־יָבֹא in v.6—durative action, emphasis, certainty, or narrative vividness?",
      "How does Psalm 126 relate literarily and thematically to other Songs of Ascents, particularly those dealing with restoration (Psalms 122, 125, 129) and agricultural imagery (Psalm 128)?",
      "What is the relationship between מֶשֶׁךְ־הַזָּרַע ('seed-bag' or 'trail of seed') and אֲלֻמֹּתָיו ('his sheaves')—is there quantitative contrast (little seed vs. abundant harvest) or merely qualitative (what is sown vs. what is reaped)?",
