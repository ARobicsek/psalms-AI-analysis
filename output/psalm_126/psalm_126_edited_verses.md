**Verse 1**  
שִׁ֗יר הַמַּ֫עֲל֥וֹת; בְּשׁ֣וּב יְהוָה אֶת־שִׁיבַ֣ת צִיּוֹן; הָ֝יִ֗ינוּ כְּחֹלְמִֽים׃  
“A Song of Ascents. When YHWH restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like dreamers.”

The superscription שִׁיר הַמַּעֲלוֹת (*shir ha‑ma‘alot*, “Song of Ascents”) links this psalm to the pilgrimage collection (Psalms 120–134), probably sung by those ascending to Jerusalem. Already we are placed on a road.

The key phrase בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה (*b’shuv YHWH*) uses an infinitive form—literally “in (the) returning of YHWH”—that can point backward (“when YHWH restored”) or forward (“when YHWH restores”). Medieval readers divided along that fault. Ibn Ezra, attending to historical context, anchors it in the return from Babylon; Rashi hears it as “prophetic perfect,” a past tense used for a guaranteed future, so that the current exile will someday be reclassified as “a dream.”

The noun שִׁיבַת צִיּוֹן (*shivat Tzion*) is equally rich. Many manuscripts preserve a variant vocalization שְׁבִיתַת / שְׁבוּת צִיּוֹן (*sh’vit / sh’vut Tzion*), from שָׁבָה (*shavah*, “to take captive”), yielding “captivity/fortunes of Zion.” Elsewhere the idiom שׁוּב שְׁבוּת (*shuv sh’vut*) means “restore fortunes” or “reverse captivity,” as in Jeremiah 29:14, וְשַׁבְתִּי אֶת־שְׁבוּתְכֶם (“I will restore your fortunes”). Our verse knowingly leans on both roots: שׁוּב (*return*) and שָׁבָה (*captivity*). God is said to “return the return” and “reverse the captivity,” compressing geography, politics, and destiny into one act.

The simile הָיִינוּ כְּחֹלְמִים (*hayinu k’cholmim*), “we were like dreamers,” links this restoration to the Bible’s dream‑tradition (Joseph, Daniel), where dreams often mediate divine plans. But as noted in the introduction, a second root חָלַם (*ḥalam*) means “to be healthy, thrive.” In Job 39:4, בְּנֵיהֶם יַחְלְמוּ is best rendered “their young grow strong,” and Isaiah 38:16 uses a related form for “restore me to health.” Read this way, the psalm says, “we were like those restored to health”: exile was an illness, and return is convalescence. The double sense—unreal vision and recovered vitality—mirrors the community’s disorientation: one wakes from a long sickness blinking in the light.

Rabbinic tradition took the dream literally and theologically. Ta’anit 23a tells of חוֹנִי הַמְעַגֵּל, Honi the Circle-Maker, who ponders our verse and asks, “מי איכא דנים שבעין שנין בחלמא – Is it possible for a person to dream for seventy years?” He then sleeps seventy years beneath a rocky outcrop while a carob tree matures, waking to a world that has moved on. When the sages in the study hall do not recognize him, he prays for death: או חברותא או מיתותא, “companionship or death.” The story treats the seventy-year Babylonian exile as a kind of communal sleep, and exposes the pathos of waking into a reality you have longed for but no longer belong to. To be “like dreamers” is both ecstasy and estrangement.

Finally, note that the perfect verb הָיִינוּ (*hayinu*, “we were”) recurs in verse 3 (הָיִינוּ שְׂמֵחִים, “we were joyful”), bracketing the nations’ testimony. The psalm’s first movement is framed as remembered experience—but the petition that follows will insist that it is also, and perhaps more urgently, desired.

**Verse 2**  
אָ֤ז יִמָּלֵ֪א שְׂח֡וֹק פִּינוּ֮; וּלְשׁוֹנֵ֢נוּ רִ֫נָּ֥ה; אָ֭ז יֹאמְר֣וּ בַגּוֹיִ֑ם; הִגְדִּ֥יל יְ֝הוָ֗ה לַעֲשׂ֥וֹת עִם־אֵלֶּה׃  
“Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with ringing shout; then they said among the nations, ‘YHWH has done great things with these.’”

The double אָז (*az*, “then… then”) gives this verse its pulse: first the bodily reaction of Israel, then the commentary of the world. The verb יִמָּלֵא (*yimmalē’*, “was/will be filled”) portrays laughter not as voluntary amusement but as something that floods the mouth. The parallel phrase וּלְשׁוֹנֵנוּ רִנָּה (*ul’shonenu rinah*) adds the tongue, instrument of articulate praise, now overrun with רִנָּה (*rinah*), a “ringing cry” that can in other contexts be either supplication or jubilation. Here it is clearly the latter, but the word’s double life will matter in verses 5–6, where tears and *rinah* are paired.

The second colon shifts the scene outward: “then they will say among the nations.” The form יֹאמְרוּ (*yomru*, “they will say”) is imperfect, but in context it can be read as either future (“they shall say”) or narrating what happened (“then they said”). Either way, the content of their speech—הִגְדִּיל יְהוָה לַעֲשׂוֹת עִם־אֵלֶּה (*higdil YHWH la‘asot im‑eleh*, “YHWH has done great things with these”)—echoes Joel 2:21, גִּילִי וּשְׂמָחִי כִּי־הִגְדִּיל יְהוָה לַעֲשׂוֹת (“Rejoice and be glad, for YHWH has done great things”), where the “great things” are abundant rain and restored crops. That intertext silently aligns political restoration with ecological blessing.

Theologically, the nations’ chorus resonates with Deutero‑Isaiah’s vision: “YHWH has bared His holy arm before the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God” (חָשַׂף יְהוָה אֶת זְרוֹעַ קׇדְשׁוֹ… וְרָאוּ כׇּל־אַפְסֵי־אָרֶץ, Isaiah 52:10). Divine fidelity to Israel is meant to be legible beyond Israel.

Rabbinic halakhah reads this verse with characteristic caution. Berakhot 31a teaches: “אסור לאדם שימלא שחוק פיו בעולם הזה, שנאמר, אָז יִמָּלֵא שְׂחוֹק פִּינוּ—It is forbidden for a person to fill his mouth with laughter in this world, as it is said, ‘Then our mouth will be filled with laughter.’” R. Yohanan reports that from the day he heard this from his teacher, he never fully laughed again. Unchecked mirth is reserved for the eschatological “then” of complete restoration; in the meantime, joy is real but must be alloyed with awareness of what is broken.

Liturgically, the phrase וּלְשׁוֹנֵנוּ רִנָּה (*ul’shonenu rinah*) flowers in the *Nishmat* prayer: “Were our mouth full of song as the sea, and our tongue with ringing shout as the multitude of its waves…” (וְאִלּוּ פִינוּ מָלֵא שִׁירָה כַּיָּם; וּלְשׁוֹנֵנוּ רִנָּה כַּהֲמוֹן גַּלָּיו). There the intoxicating fullness of mouth and tongue from our psalm is stretched to cosmic proportions, only to underscore human inadequacy: even such praise would fall short.

**Verse 3**  
הִגְדִּ֣יל יְ֭הוָה לַעֲשׂ֥וֹת עִמָּ֗נוּ; הָיִ֥ינוּ שְׂמֵחִֽים׃  
“YHWH has done great things with us; we were joyful.”

This compact verse is rhetorically sophisticated. It repeats, almost word for word, the nations’ verdict from verse 2, but with a crucial modification: עִם־אֵלֶּה (*im‑eleh*, “with these”) becomes עִמָּנוּ (*imanu*, “with us”). The people of Zion internalize and endorse the external witness. What the nations saw as marvel they experience as mercy.

The verb הִגְדִּיל (*higdil*, “has made great / has done greatly”) in combination with לַעֲשׂוֹת (*la‘asot*, “to act”) is idiomatic intensification: “He has done great things.” In Joel this phrase refers to abundant rains; here it compresses a cluster of gifts—political reprieve, return to land, perhaps the rebuilding of Temple—into one evaluative statement. Malbim notes that for the nations, the “greatness” lies in historical improbability; for Israel, it lies in the re‑confirmation of a covenant announced to Abraham and reaffirmed after every catastrophe.

The second colon, הָיִינוּ שְׂמֵחִים (*hayinu s’meḥim*, “we were joyful”), is almost flat in Hebrew, two words where one might expect elaboration. It mirrors the earlier הָיִינוּ כְּחֹלְמִים (*hayinu k’cholmim*, “we were like dreamers”), forming a subtle inclusio: between “we were like dreamers” and “we were joyful” stretches the nations’ acclaim. The psalm suggests that the internal affect of joy and the altered state of dream are framed—and perhaps authenticated—by what outsiders see.

Grammatically, the perfect tense (“we were joyful”) could be retrospective or prophetic. Many medievals, including Meiri, understand the whole first half as using the “language of prophecy,” where future events are narrated as past to underscore their certainty. On this reading, “we were joyful” is a way of saying, “we shall surely be joyful,” the past tense itself a vehicle of hope.

At the same time, the ensuing imperative, שׁוּבָה יְהוָה (“Restore, O YHWH,” v. 4), whiplashes the reader from completed joy to unfinished need. Radak seizes on this: the psalm acknowledges both that “YHWH has done great things with us” in allowing any remnant to return, and that their joy is incomplete as long as the restoration is partial—Jerusalem’s walls broken, countryside barren, many exiles still in Babylon. The verse thus becomes the hinge between memory and petition.

From a liturgical standpoint, the line is heard at the Seder and Shabbat table as a daring affirmation: as we thank God for bread, we echo the nations’ imagined words and claim, perhaps prematurely, that “He has done great things with us.” The very act of reciting it in less‑than‑ideal circumstances is an exercise in what one might call grammatical faith.

**Verse 4**  
שׁ֥וּבָה יְ֭הוָה אֶת־שְׁבִיתֵ֑נוּ; כַּאֲפִיקִ֥ים בַּנֶּֽגֶב׃  
“Restore, O YHWH, our fortunes; like watercourses in the Negev.”

With verse 4, the psalm pivots sharply from narration to plea. The verb שׁוּבָה (*shuvah*, “return / restore”) is an imperative with a paragogic *he*—a suffix that often adds urgency or emotional color. Whereas verse 1 spoke of “when YHWH restored the fortunes of Zion,” here the community cries, “Restore our fortunes!” It is the same idiom (שׁוּב + שְׁבִית) now uttered not about God but to God.

The object אֶת־שְׁבִיתֵנוּ (*et‑sh’vitenu*) carries the same ambiguity as שִׁיבַת צִיּוֹן in verse 1. The *ketiv* (what is written) is commonly שְׁבוּתֵנוּ (*sh’vutenu*), “our captivity/fortunes”; the *qere* (what is read aloud) is שְׁבִיתֵנוּ (*sh’vitenu*), a form that echoes שִׁיבַת (*shivat*, return). The Masoretic willingness to preserve both suggests that, for them too, “captivity” and “return” were intertwined concepts.

The simile כַּאֲפִיקִים בַּנֶּגֶב (*ka’afikim ba‑Negev*) is geographically concrete. The Negev is the southern desert of Judah, largely dry. An אֲפִיק (*afik*) is a channel or ravine that serves as a riverbed in the rainy season but lies parched most of the year. When winter storms drench the highlands, flash floods roar through these gullies, sometimes in minutes turning dust to torrent.

The psalmist does not ask for a gentle stream but for such an afik-event: an abrupt, life‑altering inrush. Radak glosses: “The Negev is a dry land, thirsty for water; if watercourses pass through it, it is a great wonder and blessing—so is the return of our exile.” The metaphor thus denies any comfortable gradualism. After the tentative beginnings celebrated in verses 1–3, the community longs for something unmistakable.

The rabbis, acutely attuned to the agricultural dependence on rain, link this image directly to meteorology. Ta’anit 8b declares: “גדול יום הגשמים כיום קיבוץ גליות—Great is the day of rain like the day of the ingathering of exiles, as it is said, ‘Restore our fortunes, O YHWH, like watercourses in the Negev.’” Here the comparison runs both ways: as a flash flood transforms a desert, so a decisive ingathering will transform exile; conversely, each heavy rain is a rehearsal of redemption.

Behind this stands, as noted earlier, an older Canaanite pattern in the Baal cycle, where the storm god’s return brings the wadis to life. Psalm 126 has stripped out Baal and Mot, leaving bare land and Israel’s God. That theological editing is not cosmetic; it takes imagery that once legitimized nature‑deities and reassigns it to YHWH alone.

**Verse 5**  
הַזֹּרְעִ֥ים בְּדִמְעָ֗ה; בְּרִנָּ֥ה יִקְצֹֽרוּ׃  
“Those who sow in tears shall reap with ringing shout.”

We now leave the particular topography of Zion and the Negev for the proverbial field. הַזֹּרְעִים (*haz‑zor‘im*, “those who sow”) is a participle with the definite article, but in Hebrew this construction often has a generic force: “whoever sows.” The psalm broadens its lens from “our fortunes” to a universal pattern: toil through lament, joy in harvest.

The phrase בְּדִמְעָה (*b’dim‘ah*, “in tears”) may tempt a sentimental reading—pious melancholy rewarded with happiness. In the post‑exilic economy, however, sowing was terrifyingly literal. Haggai 1:6 depicts a failed agrarian cycle: “You have sown much and brought in little; you eat without being satisfied” (זְרַעְתֶּם הַרְבֵּה וְהָבֵא מְעָט; אָכוֹל וְאֵין לְשָׂבְעָה). Seed was not surplus; it was potential bread. Casting it into a dry field was an act of desperation.

Radak, sensitive to this, writes: “The seed is precious in arid land, and the poor man carrying it goes weeping, fearing it will be delayed and not sprout due to the dryness of the land.” The “tears” are not decorous; they are the anxiety of a parent risking the pantry on the weather.

בְּרִנָּה יִקְצֹרוּ (*b’rinah yiktzoru*, “they shall reap with ringing shout”) answers that anxiety with a mirror image. The same *rinah* that filled tongues in verse 2 now accompanies the sickle. The parallel is antithetical in mood (tears vs. *rinah*) but synthetic in logic: the second colon completes the first by sketching a necessary consequence. The psalm offers a kind of moral meteorology: labor carried out through lament, under the right sky, will not be wasted.

Later tradition explicitly moralizes the image. Hosea 10:12 exhorts, “Sow for yourselves righteousness, reap according to kindness” (זִרְעוּ לָכֶם לִצְדָקָה; קִצְרוּ לְפִי־חֶסֶד), making “sowing” the performance of justice and “reaping” the reception of divine mercy. Meiri reads Psalm 126 along similar lines: the commandments (*mitzvot*) done with difficulty in exile are seeds; the eschatological reward is harvest.

Christian reception universalized the proverb. Brahms chose Luther’s German of this verse (“Die mit Tränen säen, werden mit Freuden ernten”) to open his *German Requiem*, setting it to a darkly trudging rhythm that blossoms into luminous chords at “Freuden” (“joys”). The 19th‑century American hymn “Bringing in the Sheaves” reframes sowing as evangelistic labor and reaping as gathering converts. In both, the psalm’s agricultural anxiety becomes an existential one: mourning, effort, and fidelity are not the end of the story.

**Verse 6**  
הָ֘ל֤וֹךְ יֵלֵ֨ךְ ׀ וּבָכֹה֮; נֹשֵׂ֪א מֶֽשֶׁךְ־הַ֫זָּ֥רַע; בֹּֽא־יָבֹ֥א בְרִנָּ֑ה; נֹ֝שֵׂ֗א אֲלֻמֹּתָֽיו׃  
“Though he goes, he goes and weeps, bearing the measure of seed, he shall surely come with ringing shout, bearing his sheaves.”

Verse 5 stated the proverb; verse 6 dramatizes it in miniature. The plural “those who sow” becomes a singular figure: one farmer, trudging towards his field. The construction הָלוֹךְ יֵלֵךְ (*halokh yelekh*, “going he goes”) combines an infinitive absolute with a finite verb, a Hebrew way of stressing ongoing action: he keeps on going. בֹּא יָבֹא (*bo yavo*, “coming he comes”) later in the verse has the same form, underscoring the certainty and fullness of his return.

וּבָכֹה (*uvakho*, “and weeping”) rivets the reader to his inner state. This is not a stoic figure; every step is accompanied by tears. The object he carries, מֶשֶׁךְ־הַזָּרַע (*meshekh ha‑zara‘*), is lexically intriguing. BDB understands *meshekh* here as “a trail, drawing,” perhaps the line of seed dropping from his hand. Ibn Ezra takes it as the “vessel in which the sower carries the seed,” a seed-bag. The root מָשַׁךְ (*mashakh*) means “draw, pull,” suggesting effort and extension. Either way, the phrase conveys both the preciousness of the content and the strain of the task.

The second half reverses the emotional weather: בֹּא־יָבֹא בְרִנָּה (*bo yavo b’rinah*, “he shall surely come with ringing shout”). The adverbial infinitive + verb again amplifies certainty: he will indeed come. The tears have not vanished from memory, but they are now overlaid by *rinah*. What he bears on the return journey are אֲלֻמֹּתָיו (*alumotav*), “his sheaves”—bundles of stalks gathered into armfuls.

That noun, אֲלֻמָּה (*alumah*), appears elsewhere only in Joseph’s dream: “My sheaf rose and also stood upright, and behold, your sheaves gathered around and bowed down to my sheaf” (וְהִנֵּה קָמָה אֲלֻמָּתִי… וְתִשְׁתַּחֲוֶיןָ לַאֲלֻמָּתִי; Genesis 37:7). Psalm 126 gives us another dream of sheaves, but democratized: not a single sheaf of supremacy but “his sheaves”—the hard‑won bounty of an ordinary laborer. Where Joseph’s dream fueled family jealousy, this harvest quiets fear.

The verse is artfully chiastic (mirror‑structured):

- A: going out (הָלוֹךְ יֵלֵךְ)  
  - B: weeping (וּבָכֹה)  
    - C: bearing seed (נֹשֵׂא מֶשֶׁךְ־הַזָּרַע)  
  - B′: with *rinah* (בְּרִנָּה)  
    - C′: bearing sheaves (נֹשֵׂא אֲלֻמֹּתָיו)  
- A′: coming in (בֹּא יָבֹא)

At the center is the act of נֹשֵׂא (*nose’*, “bearing”), unchanged, even as contents and emotions invert. The journey itself—out and back, sowing and reaping—frames the transformation.

The Talmud exploits this in a homely agricultural midrash. Ta’anit 5a imagines an ox ploughing in famine: “When it goes out [to plough], it goes and weeps, bearing the trail of seed; when it returns, it eats clumps of grass from the furrow, as it is said, הָלוֹךְ יֵלֵךְ וּבָכֹה… בֹּא יָבֹא בְרִנָּה (‘he keeps going and weeping… he shall surely come with ringing shout’).” The beast’s experience of want and satisfaction becomes a commentary on Israel’s sowing in exile and rejoicing in redemption.

As the psalm’s last word, אֲלֻמֹּתָיו (*alumotav*, “his sheaves”) dangles without further verb; the harvest is pictured but not consumed, the joy sounded but not described. We leave the farmer mid‑stride, arms full. In liturgical time, we are always there: still going out with seed, already imagining the weight of sheaves.
