# Introduction Essay

When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion, "הָיִינוּ כְּחֹלְמִים" (*hayinu k'cholmim*)—"we were like dreamers." The opening verse of Psalm 126 contains within its five Hebrew words the entire arc of Jewish collective memory: the astonishment of return, the surreality of redemption, and the lingering question of whether either is truly complete. This seventh Song of Ascents, a mere six verses long, manages to hold in suspension an impossible duality: ecstatic memory and petitionary anguish, past and future, arrival and waiting. The psalm's enduring power lies not in resolving this tension but in making it the very engine of faith.

The central interpretive challenge of Psalm 126 has always been its temporal instability. Does "בְּשׁוּב ה׳ אֶת־שִׁיבַת צִיּוֹן" (*b'shuv Adonai et-shivat Tzion*) describe a past event—the return from Babylonian exile in 538 BCE—or does it project a future, messianic restoration? Medieval commentators split on this question. Rashi reads the entire psalm as prophetic future perfect: "When God *will* return us... we *will have been* like dreamers," imagining the current exile as a fleeting dream compared to the future redemption. Ibn Ezra, anchored in grammatical peshat, insists the text speaks historically of the Persian-period return. Radak attempts synthesis: the historical return was miraculous but incomplete—verse 4's imperative "שׁוּבָה ה׳ אֶת־שְׁבִיתֵנוּ" (*shuvah Adonai et-sh'vitenu*, "Restore our fortunes, O LORD") reveals that even after the return, they remain in some captivity. This debate is not merely academic. The psalm's temporal ambiguity is its genius, allowing every generation of worshipers to locate themselves simultaneously in all three tenses: remembering past deliverance, lamenting present incompleteness, and trusting in certain future redemption.

The macro structure reinforces this temporal triangulation through genre modulation. Verses 1-3 function as thanksgiving, narrating a completed restoration in perfect-tense verbs. The nations witness Israel's transformation and declare "הִגְדִּיל ה׳ לַעֲשׂוֹת עִם־אֵלֶּה" (*higdil Adonai la'asot im-eleh*, "The LORD has done great things for them"), which Israel then appropriates: "הִגְדִּיל ה׳ לַעֲשׂוֹת עִמָּנוּ הָיִינוּ שְׂמֵחִים" (*higdil Adonai la'asot imanu hayinu s'meḥim*, "The LORD has done great things for us; we are joyful"). This verbatim repetition with pronoun shift—from *them* to *us*—marks a pivot from external validation to internal affirmation. But verse 4 shatters this celebratory mood with an urgent petition in the imperative: "Restore!" Suddenly the past-tense thanksgiving reveals itself as incomplete. The genre shifts again in verses 5-6 to proverbial wisdom, universalizing the experience through agricultural metaphor. The psalm moves the community from passive recipients of divine action (vv. 1-3) to active participants in a divinely ordained cycle (vv. 5-6), from spectators of miracle to laborers in the field.

The psalm's two central images—the watercourses of the Negev and the sowing-reaping cycle—deserve close attention, for they encode the theological stakes. The petition "כַּאֲפִיקִים בַּנֶּגֶב" (*ka'afikim baNegev*, "like watercourses in the Negev") invokes a specific meteorological phenomenon. The Negev, Israel's southern desert, is characterized by wadis—riverbeds that remain dust-dry for months until winter rains in the Judean highlands trigger sudden, violent flash floods. What matters here is not gradual irrigation but overwhelming transformation. The psalmist is not praying for a trickle of improvement; he invokes the image of life-giving deluge instantly converting barren channels into roaring streams. This is the physics of redemption: sudden, total, unmistakable.

The agricultural metaphor that follows maps this hydrological hope onto human labor. "הַזֹּרְעִים בְּדִמְעָה בְּרִנָּה יִקְצֹרוּ" (*hazor'im b'dim'ah b'rinah yiktzoru*, "Those who sow in tears will reap with songs of joy"). Modern readers often sentimentalize the "tears" as poetic melancholy, but in the subsistence economy of post-exilic Judah—where Haggai 1 records crop failure and famine—these tears represent existential dread. Seed corn was the most precious commodity, the food a family could eat today to survive but must instead bury for a hoped-for harvest. If the rains fail, the seed dies and the family starves. The phrase "נֹשֵׂא מֶשֶׁךְ־הַזָּרַע" (*nosei meshekh-hazara*, "bearing the measure/trail of seed") in verse 6 emphasizes the preciousness of what is being risked. The BDB lexicon notes *meshekh* can mean "a drawing, drawing up, a trail," suggesting not abundance but the careful, anxious carrying of limited seed. The intensive construction "הָלוֹךְ יֵלֵךְ וּבָכֹה" (*halokh yelekh uvakho*, "going he goes and weeping")—with its absolute infinitive emphasizing duration—depicts the long, tearful trudge to the field. The antithesis "בֹּא־יָבֹא בְרִנָּה נֹשֵׂא אֲלֻמֹּתָיו" (*bo-yavo b'rinah nosei alumotav*, "coming he comes with joyful song, bearing his sheaves") presents the return not as gradual satisfaction but as sudden reversal, the sheaves multiplying far beyond the seed. This is not a metaphor about perseverance generally; it is a prayer that God will honor the community's life-risking investment of faith.

The psalm's vocabulary of return is itself contested. The phrase "שִׁיבַת צִיּוֹן" (*shivat Tzion*) in verse 1 contains a textual variant that shapes interpretation. The Masoretic pointing reads *shivat*, from the root *sh-v-b* (to return), suggesting physical movement. But many manuscripts reflect a ketiv/qere divergence with *sh'vut*, from *sh-b-h* (to take captive), meaning "captivity" or, by idiom, "fortunes." The phrase "שׁוּב שְׁבוּת" (*shuv sh'vut*, "restore the fortunes/return the captivity") appears across biblical literature as a technical term for reversal of fate. This ambiguity is productive: the restoration is both a physical return to land and a liberation from bondage, both geographical and ontological.

Even more intriguing is the opening simile "הָיִינוּ כְּחֹלְמִים" (*hayinu k'cholmim*). The standard rendering "we were like dreamers" links the clause to the Joseph and Daniel narratives, where dreams are vehicles of divine revelation. The return was so miraculous it felt surreal, like waking from nightmare into impossible good. But N.H. Tur-Sinai proposed an alternative: the root may be *ḥ-l-m II*, cognate with Syriac and Aramaic forms meaning "to be healthy, strong, recovered." This would yield "we were like those restored to health," shifting from psychology (disbelief) to pathology (recovery). The nation in exile was sick; return to Zion was restoration of vitality. This reading, while less common, finds support in Job 39:4 ("their young ones are in good liking") and creates elegant parallelism with verse 4's hydrological renewal: as the wadis are revitalized by water, the people are revitalized by return. Whether "dreamers" or "healed ones," the core idea holds: the restoration induces an altered state, a transformation so total it defies ordinary consciousness.

The rabbinic tradition seized on the "dream" to explore temporal dislocation. The Babylonian Talmud (Ta'anit 23a) records that Honi the Circle Maker puzzled over the verse: "Is it possible for a man to dream for seventy years?" The ensuing narrative—in which Honi falls asleep for seven decades, wakes to find himself unrecognized, and dies in isolation—uses the psalm to expose the tragedy of the "seventy-year dream." The restoration has occurred, but the personal cost is the loss of one's world. Honi represents the pre-exilic Jew who cannot function in the post-exilic reality. The "dream" is not only joy; it is rupture.

Psalm 126's liturgical placement reveals how Jewish tradition resolved (or rather, ritualized) its temporal ambiguity. By prescribing it as the prelude to *Birkat Hamazon* on Shabbat and festivals—in explicit contrast to the mournful Psalm 137 recited on weekdays—the liturgy transforms the text from historical memory into eschatological anticipation. Every festive meal becomes a rehearsal of the ultimate restoration, the "sheaves" a foretaste of messianic abundance. The Zohar and Lurianic Kabbalah deepened this reading: the "captivity of Zion" is the exile of the *Shekhinah* (Divine Presence), and the "sheaves" are the holy sparks scattered among the nations. "Sowing in tears" becomes the mystical labor of gathering these sparks from the *kelipot* (husks of impurity). The meal is cosmic *tikkun*, repair.

Modern Zionism appropriated the psalm with striking literalism. Abraham Jacob Slucki's 1891 collection *Shivat Zion*—the title taken directly from verse 1—marshaled rabbinic endorsements for settlement, reinterpreting the metaphorical "sowing" as an actual command for agriculture. The return was no longer God's miracle to be awaited but a human project to be enacted. The debate over Israel's national anthem—between *Hatikvah* and Psalm 126 set to music—encapsulated the tension between secular activism and religious expectation. Brahms' *Ein deutsches Requiem* (1868) universalized the psalm differently, using verses 5-6 to assure the living that present grief is prelude to comfort, stripping the text of its nationalist frame.

What earned this psalm its place in the canon is its refusal to let memory rest. It insists that every restoration is both real and incomplete, that joy and tears are not sequential but simultaneous. The sower weeps because he risks everything; he will sing because God honors risk. The psalm does not resolve this paradox but sanctifies it, making the act of faith—the sowing—coextensive with redemption itself. We are always like dreamers, always sowing, always waiting for the streams to flood.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

Psalm 126 occupies a central place in Jewish liturgy, recited in full as the customary prelude to *Birkat Hamazon* (Grace After Meals) on Shabbat, festivals, and joyous occasions across Ashkenazic and Sefardic traditions. This practice deliberately contrasts with weekday usage, when the mournful Psalm 137 ("By the rivers of Babylon") is recited, thereby marking the sanctity of the festive occasion. Known by its incipit *Shir HaMa'alot*, the psalm is typically sung communally before the formal *zimmun* (invitation to prayer), transforming the act of grace into an anthem of redemption and gratitude.

Individual verses and phrases from the psalm appear across the liturgy in revealing ways. The phrase "וּלְשׁוֹנֵנוּ רִנָּה" (*ul'shonenu rinah*, "and our tongue with joyous song") from verse 2 is embedded in *Nishmat Kol Chai*, the climactic prayer concluding *Pesukei Dezimra* on Shabbat and festivals. There it forms part of a grand poetic passage: "וְאִלּוּ פִינוּ מָלֵא שִׁירָה כַּיָּם וּלְשׁוֹנֵנוּ רִנָּה כַּהֲמוֹן גַּלָּיו" ("Were our mouths as full of song as the sea, and our tongues with joyous song as the multitude of its waves..."), transforming the psalm's expression of dream-like redemption into a universal declaration of human inadequacy before divine majesty.

In the Edot HaMizrach tradition, the psalm appears in additional contexts: as part of the *Tikkun Leah* section of the midnight *Tikkun Chatzot* devotional; during *Birkat Ha'Ilanot* (Blessing of the Trees) in Nissan; and in the penitential *Vidui HaGadol* of Yom Kippur, where "מִלֵּאנוּ שְׂחוֹק פִּינוּ בָּעוֹלָם הַזֶּה" ("we filled our mouths with laughter in this world") becomes a confession of misplaced levity. These varied uses—from cosmic repair to agricultural blessing to penitential introspection—demonstrate the liturgy's capacity to read the psalm simultaneously as past memory, present reality, and future hope.
