**Verse 1**

שִׁ֗יר הַמַּ֫עֲל֥וֹת |  
בְּשׁ֣וּב יְהוָה אֶת־שִׁיבַ֣ת צִיּ֑וֹן; |  
הָ֝יִ֗ינוּ כְּחֹלְמִֽים׃  

*“A Song of Ascents. When YHWH restored the fortunes of Zion,  
we were like dreamers.”*

Start with the title. *שִׁיר הַמַּעֲל֥וֹת* (*shir ha‑ma‘alot*, “Song of Ascents”) likely means a song sung “going up”—either pilgrims ascending to Jerusalem or Levites ascending the Temple steps. So you can imagine this psalm performed on the move, with people literally climbing as they talk about a spiritual “ascent.”

The opening phrase *בְּשׁ֣וּב יְהוָה* (*b’shuv YHWH*) is grammatically tricky. It’s a verbal noun: “in the turning back by YHWH,” usually translated “when YHWH restored.” Hebrew perfect forms often talk about the past, but in poetry they can also be “prophetic perfects,” describing a future event as if it has already happened because it is so certain. That’s why commentators split: does this psalm look back at the return from Babylon, or forward to some hoped‑for future? The Hebrew safely allows both, and that ambiguity is part of the point. Every singer can stand somewhere between exile and restoration and still say these words.

Next, *שִׁיבַ֣ת צִיּ֑וֹן* (*shivat Tziyon*). As we saw, the consonants can be read either from שׁוּב (“to return”)—“the return of Zion”—or from שָׁבָה (“to take captive”)—“the captivity/fortunes of Zion.” In a lot of biblical passages the idiom *שׁוּב שְׁבוּת* (*shuv sh’vut*) means “reverse someone’s situation, restore their fortunes.” So the phrase here has a double edge: God both brings exiles home and fundamentally flips Zion’s status from disgraced to honored. The compactness of Hebrew lets one little construct phrase carry that whole arc.

Finally, the famous simile: *הָ֝יִ֗ינוּ כְּחֹלְמִֽים* (*hayinu k’cholmim*, “we were like dreamers”). On the straightforward reading, חָלַם is the regular verb “to dream.” The community experiences God’s action as so unexpected it feels unreal, dreamlike. Other psalms use dream imagery negatively—*“like a dream when one awakes”* (Psalm 73:20)—to say the wicked are ephemeral. Here it’s almost the opposite: the bad years melt away like a dream, and the new reality feels too good to grasp.

The alternative “healed ones” reading (from a cognate root meaning “to be strong, healthy”) is lexically possible and theologically rich: exile as sickness, return as convalescence. Even if students don’t buy the alternative root, just hearing it forces you to see another dimension of the metaphor: psychological disorientation and physical weakness. Either way, verse 1 presents restoration as an altered state of consciousness. You don’t calmly tick a box: “Exile over.” You stagger around like someone waking up or learning to walk again.

The Talmud’s Honi story plays with that. When he literally “dreams” the seventy years of exile away, he wakes to find that although national restoration has happened, his personal connections are gone. He dies saying, “Either companionship or death.” That midrash is not the “original meaning,” but it’s a sharp comment: even good reversals are costly and strange. The psalm gives you a line—“we were like dreamers”—big enough to hold both the joy and the disorientation.

**Verse 2**

אָ֤ז יִמָּלֵ֪א שְׂח֡וֹק פִּינוּ֮ |  
וּלְשׁוֹנֵ֢נוּ רִ֫נָּ֥ה; |  
אָ֭ז יֹאמְר֣וּ בַגּוֹיִ֑ם: |  
הִגְדִּ֥יל יְ֝הוָה לַעֲשׂ֥וֹת עִם־אֵֽלֶּה׃  

*“Then our mouth was filled with laughter,  
and our tongue with joyful song.  
Then they said among the nations,  
‘YHWH has done great things with these [people].’”*

Notice the double *אָז* (*az*, “then”). Hebrew poetry often uses repetition to create emphasis and progression—what scholars call *synthetic parallelism* (“A, and what’s more, B”). First *then* comes Israel’s reaction; *then* comes the watching world’s commentary.

The imagery is wonderfully bodily. *יִמָּלֵא שְׂחֹק פִּינוּ* (*yimmale s’choq pinu*)—“our mouth was filled with laughter”—suggests unstoppable, overflowing joy. This is not a polite chuckle. Then *וּלְשׁוֹנֵנוּ רִנָּה* (*ul’shonenu rinah*): *רִנָּה* is a “ringing cry,” a shout. Sometimes it’s a cry for help; here the parallel with laughter makes it clearly a shout of praise.

You get an interesting contrast between “inside” and “outside.” Internally, the people are laughing and singing. Externally, *בַגּוֹיִם* (*va‑goyim*, “among the nations”), onlookers are interpreting. Their line, *“הִגְדִּיל יְהוָה לַעֲשׂוֹת עִם־אֵלֶּה”* (*higdil YHWH la‘asot im‑’elleh*), is a compact Hebrew idiom. The verb *הִגְדִּיל* (*higdil*) in the causative stem means “to make great” or “to do something big.” Combined with *לַעֲשׂוֹת* (*la‘asot*, “to act / to do”), it comes out as “has done great things.” The preposition *עִם* (*‘im*, “with / for”) plus *אֵלֶּה* (*’elleh*, “these”) keeps a slight distance: the nations call Israel “these people,” not “our friends.”

Why does it matter that the nations speak? This picks up a big prophetic theme, especially in Isaiah: Israel’s restoration is supposed to be public evidence of YHWH’s power and faithfulness. Think of Isaiah 52:10: *“All the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.”* Psalm 126 imagines that recognition happening: former enemies or indifferent neighbors look at this rescued, laughing community and are forced to shrug and say, “Their God really did something.”

Liturgically, the phrase *וּלְשׁוֹנֵנוּ רִנָּה* gets repurposed in *Nishmat Kol Chai* to say, “Even if our tongues were full of *rinah* like the waves of the sea, it still wouldn’t be enough to praise You.” That’s almost the reverse situation: in the psalm, the people can hardly *avoid* laughing and shouting; in the prayer, they insist that even maximum praise falls short. Both uses lean on the same image of a tongue so full of song it’s about to burst.

Verse 2 also prepares verse 3. We’ve heard what the nations say *about* Israel; now Israel will take those very words into its own mouth.

**Verse 3**

הִגְדִּ֣יל יְ֭הוָה לַעֲשׂ֥וֹת עִמָּ֗נוּ; |  
הָיִ֥ינוּ שְׂמֵחִֽים׃  

*“YHWH has done great things for us;  
we were rejoicing.”*

This verse is almost a photocopy of the nations’ line in verse 2, with one crucial shift. Where the nations said *עִם־אֵלֶּה* (*‘im‑’elleh*, “with these [people]”), Israel now says *עִמָּנוּ* (*‘imanu*, “with us”). Same verb, same structure, different pronoun.

That’s rhetorically powerful. It shows a kind of theological echo: Israel hears what outsiders are saying about them and then claims it from the inside. You can imagine a call‑and‑response performance:

- Group A (representing the nations): *“YHWH has done great things with these!”*
- Group B (Israel): *“Yes—YHWH has done great things with us; we were rejoicing.”*

The second colon, *“הָיִינוּ שְׂמֵחִים”* (*hayinu s’mechim*, “we were rejoicing”), is grammatically simple but emotionally loaded. Again the perfect *הָיִינוּ* points to a completed state: “we were” or “we had been” joyful. Set next to the imperative in verse 4, it creates a tension: the psalm remembers—or imagines—an intense period of joy that now seems to be in the rearview mirror.

Some medieval Jewish commentators lean into the future‑oriented reading here. Rabbi David Kimhi (*Radak*, a 12th–13th‑c. grammarian) notes that prophets often describe future events in the past tense to stress their certainty. On that view, verses 1–3 are a kind of “flash‑forward”: Israel sings about the coming redemption as though it had already happened, then in verse 4 drops back into present‑tense petition.

Either way, verse 3 is a hinge. It wraps up the “then” with a terse “We were rejoicing”—no adjectives, no details, just the blunt fact of joy. And because the line is so compact, it’s easy for worshipers in quite un‑joyful circumstances to put it on and inhabit it. For one moment in the liturgy, you say “we were joyful” whether you feel it or not, which can itself be an act of hope.

**Verse 4**

שׁוּבָ֣ה יְ֭הוָה אֶת־שְׁבִיתֵ֑נוּ; |  
כַּאֲפִיקִ֥ים בַּנֶּֽגֶב׃  

*“Restore, YHWH, our fortunes,  
like watercourses in the Negev.”*

This is the psalm’s plot twist. After three verses that sound like praise for a completed salvation, we suddenly get a cry: *שׁוּבָה יְהוָה* (*shuvah YHWH*, “Restore, YHWH!”). Grammatically, *שׁוּבָה* is an imperative form of the verb שׁוּב (“to return, to turn back”). The longer *‑ה* ending often adds emotional weight—think of it as “O, turn!” rather than a flat command.

The object phrase *אֶת־שְׁבִיתֵנוּ* (*et‑sh’vitenu*) repeats the root from verse 1, again with that *shivat/sh’vut* ambiguity: “our captivity, our fortunes, our restoration.” The written form in the Masoretic Text actually points one way and the marginal reading (*qere*) another, which is like the scribes quietly telling you, “Read it both ways.” The community’s problem is not just that some bodies are in the wrong place (exile); it’s that their whole situation—political, economic, spiritual—is out of joint.

Then the simile: *“כַּאֲפִיקִים בַּנֶּגֶב”* (*ka’afikim ba‑Negev*, “like watercourses in the Negev”). The noun *אֲפִיקִים* (*afikim*) refers to channels or streambeds—wadis—that are usually bone‑dry in the Negev desert. Most of the year, they look like scars across the landscape. But when heavy rains fall in the hill country, these channels can suddenly fill with raging torrents of water. Locals know to treat them with respect; flash floods there kill people even today.

So what kind of restoration is the psalmist praying for? Not a slow, almost invisible improvement in conditions, but a shocking, public, life‑giving surge. The community feels like a dry riverbed—shaped for water but empty. They long for God to turn the surprise of verses 1–3 (“we were like dreamers”) into their present climate.

The rabbis in tractate *Ta‘anit* pick up this image and say: “Great is the day of rain like the day of the ingathering of exiles,” quoting this verse. They effectively collapse the comparison: rain *is* a little exile‑ending in miniature. That’s helpful to carry back to verses 5–6. When you see a farmer sowing in dry ground, you’re watching someone live in the gap between this petition (“restore us like floodwaters”) and the promise (“those who sow in tears will reap in joy”).

**Verse 5**

הַזֹּרְעִ֥ים בְּדִמְעָ֗ה; |  
בְּרִנָּ֥ה יִקְצֹֽרוּ׃  

*“Those who sow in tears  
will reap with joyful song.”*

Here the psalm shifts into a proverb. The subject, *הַזֹּרְעִים* (*ha‑zor‘im*), is a participle: “those who are sowing.” It’s plural and general: anyone, anywhere, who finds themselves planting under miserable conditions. The second colon supplies the outcome: *“בְּרִנָּה יִקְצֹרוּ”* (*b’rinah yiktzoru*), “with *rinah*—ringing joy—they will reap.” This is classic *antithetic parallelism*: one line states one side of reality (sowing + tears), the second states the opposite (reaping + joy), inviting you to see the connection.

It’s easy to make this sentimental: “If you’re sad now, you’ll be happy later.” But the actual agricultural picture is much sharper. In post‑exilic Judah, as books like Haggai show, harvests were unreliable. Seed was precious. When a farmer walks out to sow, he has a stark choice: eat the grain now and survive a little longer, or bury it in the hope that rain will come and multiply it. The “tears” in *בְּדִמְעָה* (*b’dim‘ah*) are not just emotional overflow; they’re fear and risk.

What does this have to do with exile and restoration? Several traditional Jewish commentators connect the “seed” here with *mitzvot*—acts of obedience—done under suffering. Radak writes that “the sowing is the performance of commandments in exile, done in tears because of the pressure of exile; the reaping is the good reward at the time of redemption.” That’s a moralizing extension, but it fits the logic of the metaphor: you entrust something costly to a future you can’t see.

Modern scholars also hear an echo of Canaanite myths, where the death and “sowing” of a fertility god bring rain back to the land. Psalm 126 seems to reuse the sowing image but strip away the dying god: here the one who goes into the ground is not a deity but ordinary people’s hope and labor, and the one who responds is YHWH.

For the flow of the psalm, verse 5 universalizes the community’s experience. The people of Zion are not uniquely tragic or uniquely blessed; they share a pattern with every farmer, artist, parent, or student who invests hard work and tears with no guarantee. That sets up verse 6, which zooms in on one such person and walks with him to the field and back.

**Verse 6**

הָ֘ל֤וֹךְ יֵלֵ֨ךְ ׀ וּבָכֹה֮ |  
נֹשֵׂ֪א מֶֽשֶׁךְ־הַ֫זָּ֥רַע; |  
בֹּֽא־יָבֹ֥א בְרִנָּ֑ה; |  
נֹ֝שֵׂ֗א אֲלֻמֹּתָֽיו׃  

*“Going he goes and weeping,  
carrying the measure of seed;  
coming he will surely come with joyful song,  
carrying his sheaves.”*

The last verse takes the proverb of verse 5 and makes it a little story. Two features of the Hebrew highlight this.

First, the doubled verb forms: *הָלוֹךְ יֵלֵךְ* (*halokh yelekh*, “going he goes”) and *בֹּא יָבֹא* (*bo yavo*, “coming he will surely come”). This construction is called an *infinitive absolute* plus a finite verb. You can think of it as putting the verb in bold: it can express either continuity (“he keeps going”) or certainty (“he will definitely go”). Here it probably carries both: the long trudge out, and the equally real, if not yet visible, journey back.

Second, the two *נֹשֵׂא* (*nose*, “carrying”) phrases form a neat contrast. On the way out, he is *“נֹשֵׂא מֶשֶׁךְ הַזָּרַע”* (*nose meshekh ha‑zara‘*). *מֶשֶׁךְ* is rare; it likely means the “bag” or “small measure” of seed, or the “trail” of seed he draws out behind him. Either way, the emphasis is on smallness and preciousness. On the way back, he is *“נֹשֵׂא אֲלֻמֹּתָיו”* (*nose alumotav*), “carrying his sheaves”—heavy bundles of harvested grain. The cargo has changed from potential to abundance.

Between those two *nose* phrases, the emotional weather also flips: *וּבָכֹה* (*u‑vakho*, “and weeping”) becomes *בְּרִנָּה* (*b’rinah*, “with joyful song”). If you map the verse out, you can see a little chiastic pattern:

- A: going
  - B: weeping
    - C: carrying seed
  - B′: with joyful song
    - C′: carrying sheaves
- A′: coming

The activity of “carrying” stays the same; what you carry, and how you feel while carrying it, change.

In the context of Psalm 126, that’s the final image you’re meant to walk away with. The community that prayed “Restore us like watercourses” is in the position of this farmer: they have already “sown” something costly—trust, obedience, maybe actual crops in a half‑ruined land—but they are still on the outward journey, still crying. The psalm doesn’t specify *when* the return with sheaves happens or what form it takes. It just insists that in God’s economy, such a return is as built‑in as harvest following sowing.

The verse has had a long afterlife. The American hymn “Bringing in the Sheaves” takes this image and makes the “seed” into acts of kindness or evangelism and the “sheaves” into people you’ve helped. Brahms, in his *German Requiem*, sets the German version to music that starts heavy and plodding, then rises into a bright, flowing melody as the “sheaves” appear. Both are commentaries in sound on what the Hebrew already does: it lets you feel the weight of the walk out and the surprising lightness of the walk back.

For a first‑century pilgrim singing this on the road to Jerusalem, or for anyone reciting it before grace after meals, verse 6 quietly invites self‑placement: Right now, am I in the “going out weeping” stage, or the “coming back singing” stage—or, as is often the case, somehow in both at once? The psalm leaves you there, between memory and hope, still sowing.
