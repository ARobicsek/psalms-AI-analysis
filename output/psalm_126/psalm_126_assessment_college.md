# Editorial Assessment (College Edition) - Psalm 126

The existing introduction and commentary are rich and insightful, but pitched more at graduate students than first‑years. Several things make it hard for beginners to digest:

- **Density and pacing.** Long paragraphs pack multiple arguments—philology, theology, reception history—into a single flow. Students will lose the thread. We need shorter sections with signposts: “Here’s the puzzle,” “Here’s one way to read it,” “So what?”

- **Unexplained jargon.** Terms like *prophetic future perfect*, *macro structure*, *peshat*, *kethiv/qere*, *ontological*, and references to “BDB” or “Deutero‑Isaiah” appear without quick glosses. First‑years can handle grammar, but need each label explained the moment it shows up.

- **Assumed background.** Figures like Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Radak, Tur‑Sinai, and Malbim appear as if students already know who they are. Same with liturgical pieces like *Tikkun Chatzot*. A one‑sentence ID for each would help a lot.

- **Missed engagement opportunities.** The essay mentions very cool things—Honi the Circle Maker, Baal‑cycle echoes, Brahms, Zionist debates—but often in a compressed, “for scholars” way. These are exactly the stories that can hook students if told more narratively and tied back to the text.

- **Tone.** The current voice is excellent academic prose; for this audience we want something closer to a seminar: direct, curious, and occasionally playful, always circling back to “why this line matters for how the psalm works.”

What follows keeps the scholarly substance but slows down, defines terms, and foregrounds the big ideas and “aha” moments.
