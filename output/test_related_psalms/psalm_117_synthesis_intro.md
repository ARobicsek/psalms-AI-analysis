# Introduction Essay: Psalm 117

The shortest psalm in the Psalter—a mere two verses, seventeen Hebrew words—makes the boldest theological claim: that the nations of the earth should praise Israel's God not for acts of universal creation or providence, but because His *ḥesed* (חֶסֶד, steadfast covenant love) has "prevailed over *us*" (עָלֵינוּ). This is the paradox at the heart of Psalm 117. The poet summons *kol-goyim* (כׇּל־גּוֹיִם, all nations) and *kol-ha'ummim* (כׇּל־הָאֻמִּֽים, all peoples) to worship the LORD, yet offers as justification an experience that is conspicuously particular: God's faithfulness to Israel. The psalm thus embodies a radical missionary theology—that YHWH's election of Israel is not an end in itself but a means of universal revelation, making Israel's covenant history the very grounds for Gentile praise.

The structure reinforces this theological movement. The psalm opens with a double imperative—*hallelu* (הַֽלְל֣וּ, praise!) and *shabbeḥuhu* (שַׁ֝בְּח֗וּהוּ, extol Him!)—creating emphatic synonymous parallelism that leaves no ambiguity about the command's urgency. The anaphoric repetition of *kol* (כׇּל, all) at the head of each colon intensifies the universalism: this is not an invitation but a summons, issued to the totality of humanity. Yet the motivation clause introduced by *ki* (כִּֽי, for) shifts the focus dramatically. The verb *gavar* (גָבַר, prevailed/was mighty) takes as its subject not YHWH Himself but His *ḥesed*, His covenant loyalty. This is an unusual grammatical choice; BDB notes that *gavar* typically takes personal subjects, suggesting strength or victory in conflict. Here, divine love is personified as an overwhelming force that has "prevailed over us"—where "us" (*'alenu*, עָלֵ֨ינוּ) can only refer to Israel.

The preposition *'al* (עַל) deserves attention. In other contexts, *gavar 'al* can suggest military victory or dominance "over" an opponent (as in Genesis 7:18-20, where the flood waters "prevail over" the earth). But in Psalm 103:11, the only other instance in the Psalter where *ḥesed* is the subject of *gavar*, the phrase is *gavar ḥasdo 'al-yere'av* (His steadfast love is mighty toward those who fear Him), where *'al* clearly indicates direction or beneficence rather than conquest. The liturgical context supports this reading; the phrase *ki-gavar 'alenu ḥasdo* appears in the Edot HaMizrach tradition as an introductory supplement before *Baruch She'amar* in *Pesukei Dezimra*, framing it as a declaration of divine favor rather than dominance. Yet the verb's martial overtones remain audible—God's mercy has "conquered" His people not through force but through relentless faithfulness.

This leads to the psalm's second motivation: *ve'emet-YHWH le'olam* (וֶאֱמֶת־יְהֹוָ֥ה לְעוֹלָ֗ם, and the truth/faithfulness of the LORD is forever). The pairing of *ḥesed* and *'emet* (אֱמֶת) is formulaic, echoing the Sinai covenant revelation in Exodus 34:6-7, where YHWH declares Himself "abounding in *ḥesed* and *'emet*." The concordance reveals this pair appearing throughout the Psalter (25:10, 40:11, 57:3, 61:7, 85:10, 86:15, 89:14), always in covenantal contexts. But here the formula undergoes a subtle transformation. Where Exodus 34:6 describes God's character as "abundant in *ḥesed* and *'emet*" (*rav-ḥesed ve'emet*), Psalm 117 splits them temporally: *ḥesed* is described with a perfect-tense verb (*gavar*, completed action in past time), while *'emet* extends into eternity (*le'olam*). The rhetorical effect is to ground YHWH's eternal reliability in historical acts of covenant faithfulness—past deliverance becomes the guarantee of future constancy.

The psalm's brevity is itself a rhetorical strategy. At seventeen words, it functions as what Radak called a "concentrated" statement, "compressing" complex theology into epigrammatic form. This compression makes the psalm supremely memorable and repeatable, ideal for liturgical use. Indeed, its placement within the Egyptian Hallel collection (Psalms 113-118), recited at major festivals, suggests it served as a responsive doxology or congregational refrain. The closing *Hallelujah* (הַֽלְלוּ־יָֽהּ) creates an inclusio with the opening *hallelu*, framing the theological statement as a self-contained liturgical unit. The shortening of the divine name from *YHWH* (יְהֹוָה) to *Yah* (יָהּ) in the closing formula is also significant; Klein's dictionary identifies *Yah* as an archaic, poetic form appearing primarily in early biblical poetry (Exodus 15:2, the Song of the Sea) and in late psalmic Hallel formulas. Its use here may signal both antiquity and intimacy—the shortened form creating a sense of direct, unmediated praise.

But why should Gentiles praise YHWH for what He did for Israel? The logic appears counterintuitive. One might expect a universalist psalm to emphasize God's role as creator of heaven and earth (as in Psalm 100:3, 146:6, or 134:3) or His provision for all humanity. Instead, Psalm 117 grounds universal worship in particular covenant history. The traditional commentators wrestled with this. Ibn Ezra suggested that *goyim* refers to nations "under David's hand"—subjugated peoples who witnessed YHWH's faithfulness to Israel and were thereby compelled to acknowledge His power. Radak took a more eschatological approach, reading the psalm as prophetic of the messianic age when "all the nations will praise Yah" because they will finally recognize that God's faithfulness to Israel reveals His universal sovereignty. The Meiri synthesized these views, arguing that the psalm demonstrates how God's particular acts of redemption for Israel become paradigmatic, revealing His character to all peoples.

The semantic distinction between *goyim* (גּוֹיִם) and *'ummim* (אֻמִּֽים) may illuminate this logic. BDB suggests that *goyim* typically refers to ethnic or national groups (often with political connotations, as in "nations" or "Gentiles"), while *le'ummim* (from the root *le'om*, לְאֹם) carries more poetic weight, appearing primarily in parallelism with *goyim* to intensify universalism (as in Psalm 2:1, "Why do the *goyim* rage and the *le'ummim* plot in vain?"). The doubling creates a merism—not just some nations but *all* peoples, without exception. This rhetorical amplification suggests that Israel's experience of divine *ḥesed* is meant to be not merely witnessed but paradigmatic: what God did for "us" reveals what He desires for "all."

Paul's citation of Psalm 117:1 in Romans 15:11 as part of his scriptural argument for Gentile inclusion in the Messiah illuminates this missionary reading. Paul strings together a chain of Old Testament texts (Deuteronomy 32:43, Psalm 18:49, Psalm 117:1, Isaiah 11:10) to demonstrate that the Torah itself anticipated Gentile worship of Israel's God. For Paul, the psalm's imperative to the nations was not merely eschatological hope but apostolic mandate: Israel's experience of covenant mercy creates the condition for Gentile faith. This interpretive move—treating Israel's particular redemption as a universal testimony—appears latent in the psalm itself, where the *ki* clause functions not as exclusionary ("praise Him because He loved *us* and not you") but as evidential ("praise Him because His faithfulness to us proves His character is reliable").

Psalm 117 thus earns its place in the canon not despite its brevity but because of it. In two verses, it crystallizes the Bible's missional logic: election serves revelation. God chooses Israel not to hoard divine favor but to make it visible, to create a people whose experience of *ḥesed* becomes the world's evidence of God's character. The psalm's universalism is not abstract or generic—it doesn't appeal to the heavens and the earth or the seas and their fullness. Instead, it makes the scandalous claim that Israel's covenantal history is itself the universal truth. The brevity enforces the point: there is nothing more to say. If God's steadfast love has prevailed over us, and if His faithfulness endures forever, then what other conclusion can the nations draw but *Hallelujah*?

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

Psalm 117 is recited in its entirety as part of the full Hallel service (Psalms 113-118) following the Shacharit Amidah on festivals (Pesach, Shavuot, Sukkot), Rosh Chodesh, Chanukah, and during the Nirtzah section of the Passover Seder. This placement situates the psalm within contexts of communal celebration and thanksgiving, where its themes of divine faithfulness and universal praise resonate with the festival's commemorative focus on redemption. The psalm's appearance in Hallel reflects the tradition's understanding of it as a hymn of praise appropriate for moments when Israel recalls God's saving acts.

Beyond its full recitation, individual phrases from Psalm 117 appear in various liturgical contexts across different traditions. The phrase *ki-gavar 'alenu ḥasdo ve'emet-YHWH le'olam* (כִּי־גָבַר עָלֵינוּ חַסְדּוֹ וֶאֱמֶת־יְהֹוָה לְעוֹלָם, "For His mercy has prevailed over us, and the truth of the Lord endures forever") is recited in the Edot HaMizrach tradition as an introductory supplement before *Baruch She'amar* during *Pesukei Dezimra* on Shabbat, Rosh Hashanah, and Yom Kippur. This usage recontextualizes the verse, transforming it from a motivation for universal praise into a personal or communal affirmation of God's enduring mercy at the threshold of the morning praise service.

The phrase *'alenu ḥasdo* (עָלֵינוּ חַסְדּוֹ, "His mercy is upon us") appears in Sefard tradition during the Simchat Torah Hakafot and in Shabbat Zemirot, where it is embedded in the liturgical declaration: "מִכָּל אוֹם גָּבַר עָלֵינוּ חַסְדּוֹ" ("Over all nations His mercy has prevailed upon us"). This formulation emphasizes God's particular relationship with Israel while maintaining the psalm's universalist framing, suggesting that the liturgy reads the psalm as affirming both Israel's unique covenantal experience and God's ultimate sovereignty over all peoples. The recurrence of these phrases across diverse liturgical occasions—from daily Shabbat observance to High Holidays to festival celebrations—demonstrates the tradition's recognition of Psalm 117's theological density despite (or perhaps because of) its extreme brevity.
