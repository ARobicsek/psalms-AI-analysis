## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (10)

1. What is the semantic range and differentiation between גּוֹיִם (goyim) and אֻמִּים (ummim)? Are these precise synonyms or do they carry distinct connotations (ethnic vs. political groupings, for instance)?
2. How does the verb גָבַר function elsewhere in the Psalter and biblical literature? What does it mean for חֶסֶד to 'prevail' or 'be mighty' - does this suggest overwhelming abundance, victory over opposition, or something else?
3. What is the theological relationship between חֶסֶד and אֱמֶת in covenant contexts? Where else are they paired (concordance study), and does the pairing have formulaic significance?
4. How does Psalm 117 relate to other universalistic psalms (e.g., Psalms 67, 96-99, 100)? Does it represent a distinct strand of universalism, and how does its brevity compare to more elaborate universal praise hymns?
5. What is the liturgical function and placement of Psalm 117 within the Egyptian Hallel (Psalms 113-118)? How would it have been performed in Second Temple worship?
6. How does Paul's citation of this psalm in Romans 15:11 interpret its universalism in relation to Gentile inclusion in the Messiah? Does Paul's hermeneutic illuminate the psalm's original intent?
7. What is the significance of the prepositional phrase עָלֵינוּ (over us/toward us/upon us)? Does it suggest direction, abundance, or overwhelming presence?
8. What Ancient Near Eastern parallels exist for calling foreign nations to praise one's national deity? Is this phenomenon unique to Israel's monotheistic claims?
9. Why is this the shortest psalm in the Psalter? Is brevity itself a rhetorical or liturgical strategy, and does the psalm's position between the longer Psalms 116 and 118 create intentional contrast?
10. How does the LXX's use of κραταιόω ('to strengthen/confirm/make mighty') for גָבַר affect interpretation? Does the Greek suggest active strengthening versus the Hebrew's stative 'being mighty'?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (10)

1. Why does the psalm use גָבַר (prevail/be mighty) rather than a more typical verb like רַב (be great/abundant) for describing חֶסֶד—does this suggest חֶסֶד overcame opposition or obstacle?
2. What is the semantic distinction between גּוֹיִם and אֻמִּים, and why use both terms in parallel—are they true synonyms or do they shade meaning differently (ethnic vs. political groupings, e.g.)?
3. How does the prepositional phrase עָלֵינוּ (upon/over/toward us) function—does עַל suggest overwhelming abundance, directional movement, or superiority?
4. Why place the shortest psalm in the Psalter between much longer Psalms 116 and 118—is brevity itself a rhetorical statement or liturgical strategy?
5. What is the logic by which Israel's experience of divine חֶסֶד compels Gentile praise—is it evidential (they witness it), vicarious (they benefit from it), or paradigmatic (it reveals YHWH's character)?
6. How does the shift from the divine name יְהֹוָה (v.1, v.2b) to the shortened form יָהּ (v.2c) function rhetorically or theologically?
7. Does the perfect tense of גָבַר point to a specific historical moment (Exodus? Return from exile?) or to ongoing covenant history, and how would this affect interpretation?
8. What Ancient Near Eastern parallels exist for calling foreign nations to praise one's national deity, and is this summons unique given Israel's monotheistic claims?
9. How does the LXX's κραταιόω (active strengthening/confirming) rather than stative 'being mighty' shift the nuance of גָבַר—does it suggest YHWH's חֶסֶד actively strengthened Israel?
10. Why does the psalm use covenant-specific vocabulary (חֶסֶד/אֱמֶת) rather than more universal divine attributes (creator, judge, provider)—what does this reveal about Israel's missional theology?
