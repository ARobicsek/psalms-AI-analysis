# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 117

What works: The draft rightly locates Psalm 117’s paradox—calling all nations to praise on the basis of God’s covenant fidelity to Israel—and traces it through the psalm’s compact structure. The treatment of gavar (“prevailed”) is strong, noticing the personification of hesed and citing Psalm 103:11. The link to Exodus 34:6 and the recurring pair hesed/’emet is accurate. The liturgical anchoring (Hallel; Mizrahi use before Baruch She’amar) is helpful. The essay also uses reception history well (Ibn Ezra, Radak; Paul’s citation in Romans 15:11).

What needs work: 
- Tone and framing: “missionary theology” is anachronistic for a Hebrew psalm; prefer “election for the sake of revelation.” 
- Missed intertextual opportunities: Psalm 117 sits inside a web of Hallel echoes. Psalm 115:1 (“for the sake of Your hesed and Your ’emet”) stands only a page away and should be brought into view; so should Psalm 100’s final line and Psalm 146’s “keeps faith forever.” 
- Overuse of phonetic transcription: the prosodic analysis leans on stress patterns that are not crucial here; keep sound-play comments, but use transliteration only when it serves a clear point.
- The LXX: note more clearly that the Greek uses a verb meaning “to make mighty/confirm” (κραταιόω), nudging readers toward the sense of “decisive, victorious mercy.” 
- The preposition ’al (“upon/over/toward”): the draft mentions it, but should reinforce the beneficent sense with Psalm 33:22; 90:17.
- ANE parallels: briefly register that summoning other nations to praise a god is uncommon outside Israel’s monotheistic frame; within the Psalter compare Psalms 67; 96–98. 
- Liturgical section: good begins, but it needs clearer structure, Hebrew quotations from the prayers, and sharper theological payoff (“how the community reads the psalm by using it this way”).

Figurative language: The personification of hesed as a prevailing force could be sharpened with concrete biblical parallels (Gen 7:18’s “the waters prevailed”) and contrasted with more common abundance verbs (rav, rabah). Patterns and frequency are noticed but not pressed into a distinctive reading of this psalm’s choice of gavar.

Bottom line: tighten terminology, highlight the Hallel intertextual web, right-size the sound analysis, expand ANE and LXX notes, and strengthen the liturgical section with quotations and interpretation.
