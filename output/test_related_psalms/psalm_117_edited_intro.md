Seventeen Hebrew words, two verses, and a bold claim: the peoples of the earth should praise Israel’s God because His steadfast love has “prevailed over us.” Psalm 117 is tiny by design. It does not rehearse creation or the moral order; it does not list reasons in a swelling catalogue. Instead, it compresses a theology of election and universality into an epigram. The nations (goyim) and peoples (’ummim) are summoned to praise—before any reason is given. Only then does the psalm supply the motive: “For His hesed has prevailed upon us, and the faithfulness of YHWH endures forever.”

The shape is classical hymn: summons to praise, followed by motivation, sealed with Hallelujah. Hebrew poetry typically works through parallelism, a pairing of lines (cola) in which the second line restates, intensifies, or completes the first. Verse 1 asks for universal praise twice—“Praise… all nations; extol Him, all peoples”—a form of synonymous parallelism that doubles the audience (goyim/’ummim) and the act (hallelu/shabbehu). The repeated kol (“all”) at the beginnings is anaphora (repeated word at line openings), creating a drumbeat of inclusion.

But verse 2 springs the paradox. The reason the nations should praise is not a general benefit but Israel’s particular story: “For (ki) His hesed has gavar ‘alenu.” The verb gavar means “to prevail, be mighty, overcome.” It often carries a martial or competitive edge: “the waters prevailed” in the Flood (Genesis 7:18–20); “for as high as the heavens over the earth, so has His hesed prevailed over those who fear Him” (Psalm 103:11). Here, hesed—God’s covenant loyalty—acts like a conquering force that “overwhelms” Israel. The preposition ’al (“over/upon/toward”) can imply dominance or beneficence. The Psalter shades it toward blessing: “May Your hesed, O YHWH, be upon us (’alenu)” (Psalm 33:22); “May the favor (no‘am) of the Lord our God be upon us (’alenu)” (Psalm 90:17). Psalm 117 seems to hold both senses together with a thumb on the side of mercy—God’s love has not merely been abundant; it has proven stronger than counterforces.

The pair “hesed and ’emet” (steadfast love and faithfulness) echoes the divine self-declaration at Sinai: “abounding in hesed and ’emet” (Exodus 34:6). The Psalter reworks that pair across its length. Strikingly, Psalm 115:1—only two psalms earlier in Hallel—prays, “Not to us, O YHWH… but to Your name give glory, because of Your hesed, because of Your ’emet” (עַל־חַסְדְּךָ עַל־אֲמִתֶּךָ). Psalm 117 transposes the pair into a compressed timeline: hesed is told as accomplished victory (“has prevailed”), while ’emet is projected without horizon (“the faithfulness of YHWH is forever”). Past rescue becomes the warrant for future reliability. The Greek translators (the Septuagint, or LXX) render gavar with a verb meaning “to make mighty/confirm” (κραταιόω), nudging the line toward “He has powerfully confirmed His mercy upon us”—a nuance that preserves the sense of decisive triumph.

Why address the nations at all? Israel’s poets were not shy about summoning creation to praise (Psalms 96–98; 148), but calling foreign peoples to acclaim Israel’s God for Israel’s sake is rarer and depends on Israel’s monotheistic claim: the God who bound Himself to this people is, in fact, the God of all. Medieval commentators offer different angles. Ibn Ezra, ever concise, reads the nations as those “under David’s hand,” who saw YHWH’s fidelity to Israel and were compelled to acknowledge it. Radak widens the lens to the messianic future when the nations will recognize God’s sovereignty through Israel’s redemption. Malbim imagines concrete historical ripples: when YHWH rescued Israel, surrounding nations benefited and thus had their own reasons to praise. A later reader, Paul, cites Psalm 117:1 in Romans 15:11 among a chain of texts to argue for the inclusion of Gentiles in praise of Israel’s God; whether or not one shares his christological conclusion, his hermeneutical instinct is close to the psalm’s: Israel’s particular deliverance is evidence for a universal truth.

Psalm 117’s brevity is not an accident of composition; it is a strategy. It functions like a liturgical refrain in the Egyptian Hallel (Psalms 113–118), the festival collection for Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot. Hallel begins with God’s raising of the lowly (Psalm 113), moves through thanksgiving for rescue (Psalms 114–116), and culminates in national acclamation (Psalm 118). Set just before that climax, Psalm 117 crystallizes the logic of the whole: God’s steadfast love toward Israel, proven in history, discloses who God is—for everyone. The closing “Hallelujah” (הַלְלוּ־יָהּ) forms an inclusio (a frame with repeated words at the beginning and end) with the psalm’s opening “Praise,” and the shortened divine name Yah, found both in early poetry (Exodus 15:2) and in late Hallel formulae, lends an air of liturgical intimacy.

A final word on terms. Parallelism is the basic engine of Hebrew verse: one line paired with a second that restates, sharpens, or completes it. Anaphora is beginning successive lines with the same word. Inclusio brackets a unit with repeated words or ideas. The “perfect” verb tense in biblical Hebrew often views an action as complete; here, “has prevailed” presents hesed as a finished triumph. These simple pieces serve a sparse, forceful theology: election serves revelation. YHWH’s fidelity to Israel is not a private possession but a public proof.

#### Full psalm

Psalm 117 is recited in full as part of Hallel (Psalms 113–118) at Shacharit on festivals (Pesach, Shavuot, Sukkot), Chanukah, and Rosh Chodesh. At the Passover Seder, it appears in the second half of Hallel before the fourth cup. Its position between Psalms 116 and 118 turns it into a hinge: the individual’s thanksgiving (116) gives way to a universal summons (117) and then to Israel’s national acclamation (118).

#### Phrases

כִּ֥י־גָ֘בַ֤ר עָלֵ֨ינוּ ׀ חַסְדּ֗וֹ וֶאֱמֶת־יְהֹוָ֥ה לְעוֹלָ֗ם (“For His mercy has prevailed over us, and the faithfulness of YHWH endures forever,” 117:2). In Edot HaMizrach, this line is said as an optional opening before Baruch She’amar on Shabbat, Rosh Hashanah, and Yom Kippur: יש אומרים: כִּי גָבַר עָלֵינוּ חַסְדּוֹ וֶאֱמֶת יְ־הוָה לְעוֹלָם הַלְלוּיָהּ; בָּרוּךְ שֶׁנָּתַן לְעַמּוֹ יִשְׂרָאֵל… (“Some say: For His mercy has prevailed over us… Hallelujah; Blessed is He who gave to His people Israel…”). The line becomes a threshold confession: before the praise section begins, the congregation names God’s prevailing mercy as the premise of worship.

עָלֵינוּ חַסְדּוֹ (“His mercy is upon us,” 117:2). In Sefard communities this phrase is embedded in Simchat Torah Hakafot and in Shabbat zemirot: מִכָּל אוֹם גָּבַר עָלֵינוּ חַסְדּוֹ (“Over every nation His mercy has prevailed upon us”). The abbreviated quotation heightens the psalm’s central claim—divine mercy “upon us”—and reads it as covenantal constancy celebrated in dance and at table.

וֶאֱמֶת־יְהֹוָה לְעוֹלָם (“the faithfulness of YHWH is forever,” 117:2). Ashkenazi High Holiday piyyutim sometimes weave this clause into the Kedushah of the Amidah on Yom Kippur Shacharit (e.g., “מֶלֶךְ וֶאֱמֶת יְהוָה לְעוֹלָם הַלְלוּיָהּ” – “King—and the faithfulness of YHWH is forever—Hallelujah”), a liturgical flourish that turns the psalm’s conclusion into an affirmation of God’s unchanging sovereignty at the day’s holiest moment.

These uses show how tradition “hears” Psalm 117: as a compact credo that inaugurates praise (“His mercy has prevailed”), fuels celebration (“His mercy is upon us”), and anchors awe (“His faithfulness is forever”).
