# Verse-by-Verse Commentary: Psalm 117

## Verse 1

**Hebrew Text:**
הַֽלְל֣וּ אֶת־יְ֭הֹוָה כׇּל־גּוֹיִ֑ם שַׁ֝בְּח֗וּהוּ כׇּל־הָאֻמִּֽים׃

**English Translation:**
"Praise the LORD, all nations; extol Him, all peoples."

The verse opens with a rhetorical shock: a double imperative addressed to *kol-goyim* (כׇּל־גּוֹיִם, all nations) and *kol-ha'ummim* (כׇּל־הָאֻמִּֽים, all peoples), summoning the Gentile world to worship Israel's God before any justification is offered. This is not invitation but command, and the anaphoric repetition of כׇּל ("all") at the head of each colon intensifies the universalism through emphatic parallelism. The phonetic transcription reveals the verse's rhythmic power: `**HAL**-lū 'eth-yə-hō-**WĀH** kol-gō-**YIM** shab-**ḤŪ**-hū kol-hā-'um-**MIY**-m`. The stress pattern creates a 3+3 balance (stresses on HAL, WĀH, YIM in the first colon; ḤŪ, MIY in the second), with the guttural `kh` sound in `shab-**ḤŪ**-hū` adding visceral force to the exhortation.

The pairing of *hallelu* (הַֽלְל֣וּ, praise) and *shabbeḥuhu* (שַׁ֝בְּח֗וּהוּ, extol) is not mere synonymous parallelism but intensification. BDB distinguishes *hallel* as the common term for liturgical praise, while *shabaḥ* is a late Aramaism (appearing primarily in Psalms 117, 147, 63, and 145) meaning "to laud" or "commend." The choice of this rarer, more formal verb in the second colon elevates the register, moving from the general call to praise toward a more solemn, official act of public commendation. Ibn Ezra, reading the psalm through a Davidic lens, suggests that *goyim* refers to "nations under David's hand"—subjugated peoples compelled by Israel's military success to acknowledge YHWH's power. Yet the psalm's placement in the Egyptian Hallel collection and its liturgical use at festivals points beyond any historical moment to an eschatological vision.

The semantic distinction between *goyim* and *'ummim* merits attention. BDB notes that *goyim* typically designates ethnic or national groups with political connotations (often translated "Gentiles" or "nations"), while *le'ummim* (from the root לְאֹם) is a more poetic term appearing primarily in parallelism with *goyim* to create a merism—a totality expressed through complementary parts. The doubling suggests not merely some nations but *all* peoples without exception, from every ethnic and political configuration. Radak, writing in 13th-century Provence, interprets this universalism eschatologically: "This psalm is for the days of the Messiah... all the nations will praise Yah because they will all acknowledge Him then." The brevity—just two verses—underscores the psalm's epigrammatic force, making it supremely memorable for liturgical repetition.

The verse's appearance in Jewish liturgy reinforces its universal scope. It is recited in its entirety as part of the full Hallel (Psalms 113–118) during festivals, Rosh Chodesh, Chanukah, and at the Passover Seder's Nirtzah section. This positioning within Hallel—the liturgical celebration of divine redemption—transforms the call to Gentile praise from mere wishful thinking into a covenantal expectation: Israel's experience of deliverance becomes the world's evidence of God's character. Paul's citation of this verse in Romans 15:11 as scriptural proof for Gentile inclusion in the Messiah illuminates the psalm's missionary logic latent in the Hebrew text itself. The apostle strings together a catena of Old Testament texts (Deuteronomy 32:43, Psalm 18:49, Psalm 117:1, Isaiah 11:10) to argue that the Torah itself anticipated Gentile worship—not as an eschatological surprise but as the divinely intended telos of Israel's election. The psalm's opening imperative, then, is not merely predictive but programmatic: Israel exists *for* the nations' praise.

## Verse 2

**Hebrew Text:**
כִּ֥י־גָ֘בַ֤ר עָלֵ֨ינוּ ׀ חַסְדּ֗וֹ וֶאֱמֶת־יְהֹוָ֥ה לְעוֹלָ֗ם הַֽלְלוּ־יָֽהּ׃

**English Translation:**
"For His steadfast love has prevailed over us, and the truth of the LORD endures forever. Hallelujah."

The *ki* (כִּי, for) introduces the theological paradox at the psalm's heart: the nations should praise YHWH *because* His covenant loyalty has "prevailed over us"—where "us" (עָלֵ֨ינוּ) can only refer to Israel. The verb *gavar* (גָבַר) is striking. BDB indicates that *gavar* typically takes personal subjects and means "to be strong," "to prevail," or "to overcome," often with martial overtones (Genesis 7:18-20, where floodwaters "prevail over" the earth; 2 Samuel 1:23, where warriors are "mightier than" enemies). Here, divine *ḥesed* (חַסְדּ֗וֹ, steadfast covenant love) is personified as an overwhelming force. This is unusual: one expects a verb like *rabah* (to be abundant) or *gadol* (to be great). The only other instance in the Psalter where *ḥesed* is the grammatical subject of *gavar* is Psalm 103:11: "כִּי כִגְבֹהַּ שָׁמַיִם עַל־הָאָרֶץ גָּבַר חַסְדּוֹ עַל־יְרֵאָיו" ("For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is His steadfast love toward those who fear Him"). The comparative context—divine mercy as high as the heavens—suggests *gavar* here conveys overwhelming magnitude rather than military conquest, yet the verb's semantic range retains an echo of triumph.

The preposition עַל (*'al*) adds complexity. It can mean "over" (suggesting dominance), "upon" (suggesting beneficent covering), or "toward" (indicating direction). The NJPS translation opts for "toward," but the martial connotations of *gavar* pull the phrase toward "prevailed over us"—as if God's mercy conquered Israel through relentless faithfulness rather than through force. Rashi glosses: "כְּלוֹמַר: וְאַף כִּי אֲנַחְנוּ, אֲשֶׁר גָּבַר עָלֵינוּ חַסְדּוֹ" ("That is to say: and surely we [must praise Him], for His kindness has overwhelmed us"). The Meiri, synthesizing medieval rationalist exegesis, explains that God's particular acts for Israel become paradigmatic: "כי גבר עלינו חסדו... להוציאנו מתחת ידם ומתחת סבלותם" ("For His mercy has prevailed over us... to bring us out from under their hand and from under their burdens"). The phrase's appearance in Edot HaMizrach liturgy as an introductory supplement before *Baruch She'amar* in Pesukei Dezimra on Shabbat, Rosh Hashanah, and Yom Kippur recontextualizes it: what begins as motivation for universal praise becomes a personal or communal affirmation of experienced divine mercy at the threshold of the morning praise service.

The pairing of *ḥesed* (חֶסֶד) and *'emet* (אֱמֶת) is formulaic, echoing the Sinai covenant revelation in Exodus 34:6-7, where YHWH declares Himself "רַב־חֶסֶד וֶאֱמֶת" ("abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness"). This covenant pair appears throughout the Psalter (25:10, 40:11, 57:3, 61:7, 85:10, 86:15, 89:14), always in covenantal contexts. But here the formula undergoes subtle transformation. Where Exodus 34:6 describes God's character as "abundant in *ḥesed* and *'emet*," Psalm 117 splits them temporally: *ḥesed* is described with a perfect-tense verb (*gavar*, completed action in past time), while *'emet* extends into eternity (*le'olam*, לְעוֹלָ֗ם). The rhetorical effect is profound: past deliverance becomes the guarantee of future constancy. God's faithfulness (*'emet*) is not abstract principle but demonstrated reliability—He kept His promise "שֶׁהִבְטִיחַ אֶת הָאָבוֹת" ("that He promised the Patriarchs"), as Rashi notes, citing Genesis 15:18-21. Radak reinforces this temporal arc: "עד שהוציאנו מן הגלות שלא הייתם מאמינים שיוכל להיות, ועתה הודו ואמרו כולם ואמת ה׳ לעולם" ("Until He brought us out from exile, which you would not have believed could happen, and now acknowledge and say, all of you, that the truth of the LORD is forever").

The closing *Hallelujah* (הַֽלְלוּ־יָֽהּ) creates an inclusio with the opening *hallelu* (הַֽלְל֣וּ), framing the psalm as a self-contained liturgical unit. The phonetic transcription highlights the verse's rhythmic closure: `kiy-**GHĀ**-var ʿā-**LĒY**-nū ḥas-**DŌ** we-'e-meth-yə-hō-**WĀH** lə-ʿō-**LĀM** hal-lū-**YĀH**-h`. The stress pattern moves from the central *gavar* through *ḥesed* to the eternal *le'olam*, culminating in the shortened divine name *Yah* (יָהּ). Klein's dictionary identifies *Yah* as an archaic, poetic form appearing primarily in early biblical poetry (Exodus 15:2, the Song of the Sea) and in late psalmic Hallel formulas. Its use here signals both antiquity and intimacy—the shortened form creates a sense of direct, unmediated praise that closes the circle opened by the initial imperative to the nations. This brevity is itself a rhetorical strategy: at seventeen Hebrew words, the psalm compresses complex theology into epigrammatic form, making it supremely memorable and repeatable for liturgical use.

The psalm's logic now becomes clear. Why should Gentiles praise YHWH for what He did for Israel? Because Israel's covenantal history is not an end in itself but a revelation of divine character. The psalmist does not appeal to universal acts of creation or providence (contrast Psalm 100:3, 146:6, 134:3) but to particular covenant experience. Yet this particularity becomes universal testimony: if God's *ḥesed* has "prevailed" over Israel, and if His *'emet* endures *le'olam*, then the nations can trust His character. Election serves revelation. The missionary theology is latent but unmistakable: Israel's experience of divine faithfulness becomes the world's evidence that YHWH is worthy of worship. The Malbim, writing in the 19th century as a polemicist against the Haskalah, argues that the phrase demonstrates how even non-Israelite nations benefit from God's covenant fidelity to Israel: "גם הגוים כולם... יהללו את ה׳ על כי גבר עלינו חסדו, שעי״ז ניצולו גם השבוים ההמה" ("Even all the nations... will praise the LORD because His mercy has prevailed upon us, for through this even those captives were saved"). The psalm thus embodies Israel's missional calling: to be a light to the nations not through self-promotion but through transparent fidelity to the covenant, making visible to all peoples the character of the God who keeps His promises.
