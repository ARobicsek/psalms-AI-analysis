**Verse 1**

“הַֽלְל֣וּ אֶת־יְהוָה כׇּל־גּוֹיִם; שַׁבְּח֗וּהוּ כׇּל־הָאֻמִּֽים.”  
“Praise YHWH, all nations; extol Him, all peoples.”

The psalm begins with a double imperative—הַלְלוּ (“praise”) and שַׁבְּחוּהוּ (“extol him”)—that exemplifies synonymous parallelism, where the second colon restates and intensifies the first. The two addressees, “nations” (גּוֹיִם) and “peoples” (אֻמִּים), are likewise paired terms. BDB notes that le’om/’ummim is a poetic word for people-group that frequently stands in parallel with goy/goyim (cf. Psalm 2:1: “לָמָּה רָגְשׁוּ גוֹיִם… וּלְאֻמִּים יֶהְגּוּ רִיק,” “Why do the nations rage… and the peoples mutter vain things?”). The effect is a merism of humanity’s public life—the political (“nations”) and the kin-cultural (“peoples”)—claiming the whole. The anaphora of כׇּל (“all”) at the head of each colon hammers the point.

The verbs sharpen the register. הִלֵּל is the Psalter’s ordinary verb for liturgical praise; שִׁבֵּחַ, a late (Aramaic-tinged) verb, often means “to laud/commend” in a formal sense (BDB s.v. שׁבח²). The second colon thus “steps up” the call: not only common praise but public commendation is required. The line fits the hymnic pattern: a summons first, reasons later. It is also a rhetorical gambit. The psalmist commands the world before explaining why it should listen.

The address to the nations has analogues within the Psalms (e.g., Psalm 67; 96–98; 100). It is relatively unusual in ancient Near Eastern hymnody, where deities are often national patrons; here Israel’s poet presumes a universal claim. Set within Hallel, the summons resonates with Psalm 115’s open challenge to the nations—“לָמָּה יֹאמְרוּ הַגּוֹיִם: אַיֵּה־נָא אֱלֹהֵיהֶם?” (“Why should the nations say, ‘Where is now their God?’,” 115:2)—and Psalm 118’s worldwide triumph. The call is either anticipatory (the eschatological acknowledgement Radak describes), evidentiary (the witnesses Ibn Ezra imagines), or both.

Reception is instructive. Paul cites “Praise the Lord, all you nations” in Romans 15:11 as one bead in a chain (Deut 32:43; Ps 18:49; Ps 117:1; Isa 11:10) to argue that Israel’s Scriptures foresee Gentile praise. His hermeneutic depends on the psalm’s own logic: the summons is not parochial but genuinely universal. Jewish liturgy keeps the line at the center of festival celebration; recited by Israel, the call to the nations has the texture of vocation—Israel exists so that this praise will happen.

Formally, this verse is terse (only five words per colon in Hebrew) and balanced. The two cola mirror each other in syntax: imperative + object + addressee; imperative + pronominal suffix + addressee. That syntactic parallelism creates the “rhythm of thought” that biblical poetry favors. Sound-play is present but not programmatic; what drives the line is the semantic symmetry and the boldness of its horizon: “all… all.”

**Verse 2**

“כִּ֥י־גָ֘בַ֤ר עָלֵ֨ינוּ ׀ חַסְדּ֗וֹ; וֶאֱמֶת־יְהוָ֥ה לְעוֹלָ֗ם. הַֽלְלוּ־יָֽהּ.”  
“For His steadfast love has prevailed upon us; and the faithfulness of YHWH is forever. Hallelujah.”

The ki (“for”) now supplies what the first verse withheld: the reason for universal praise. The shock is deliberate: the “because” is not cosmic order or general providence, but Israel’s particular experience—“upon us” (עָלֵינוּ). The theological work is done by a verb and a pair. The verb is גָבַר (gavar), “to be strong, prevail,” a word used for winning struggles and overcoming resistance. Floodwaters “prevailed” (וַיִּגְבְּרוּ) over the earth (Genesis 7:18–20); lifting Moses’ hands made “Israel prevail” (כִּי־גָבַר יִשְׂרָאֵל, Exodus 17:11). In the Psalter the only other instance of hesed as the subject of gavar is Psalm 103:11: “גָּבַר חַסְדּוֹ עַל־יִרְאֵיו” (“His steadfast love has prevailed over those who fear Him”). The psalmist chooses gavar instead of common abundance verbs (רַב/רָבָה), personifying hesed as a force that wins. The preposition עַל can suggest dominance (“over”) or beneficent covering (“upon, toward”). Elsewhere it marks blessing: “יְהִי־חַסְדְּךָ יְהוָה עָלֵינוּ” (“May Your hesed be upon us,” Psalm 33:22); “וִיהִי נֹעַם… עָלֵינוּ” (“May the favor… be upon us,” Psalm 90:17). Here it likely carries both, but the idiom of blessing leans the line toward “has overwhelmed us for good.”

Next comes the covenant pair: hesed and ’emet. From Exodus 34:6 onward, “abounding in hesed and ’emet” is a shorthand for God’s covenant character. The pair saturates the Psalms (25:10; 40:11; 57:3; 61:7; 86:15; 89:14), and in Hallel specifically it frames the theology: “Not to us… for the sake of Your hesed, for the sake of Your ’emet” (115:1). Psalm 117 splits the pair across time: hesed as a decisive past act (“has prevailed”), ’emet as open-ended reliability (“forever”). The LXX’s choice of a verb meaning “to make mighty/confirm” (κραταιόω) fits this rhetorical arc: Israel’s experience confirms God’s character; God’s character guarantees the future.

The logic that puzzled readers—why should Gentiles praise YHWH for what He did for Israel?—is clarified by this temporal pivot. Israel’s deliverance is not a private exception but the proof of the rule. Radak’s messianic reading catches one trajectory (“then all nations will praise Yah”), while Malbim’s historical reading imagines neighboring peoples benefiting from Israel’s rescue. Both reflect the psalm’s core intuition: God’s election of Israel is a means of public revelation.

The verse ends where it began: “הַלְלוּ־יָּהּ.” This is inclusio, a device where a unit is framed by repeated words or themes to mark its unity and underline its point. The shortened name Yah, used in early song (Exodus 15:2) and in the Hallel sequence, gives the doxology a kind of temple intimacy. In liturgy, the line migrates: Mizrahi communities place “כִּי גָבַר עָלֵינוּ חַסְדּוֹ” before Baruch She’amar, letting the grammar of the psalm (“for”) become the grammar of worship (“because…”). Sefard communities lift “עָלֵינוּ חַסְדּוֹ” into Hakafot and zemirot, turning a bare clause into a communal refrain. Either way, the line’s figurative punch remains: mercy that “prevails” is mercy experienced as victory.

Formally the verse moves from the perfect (“has prevailed”) to the unbounded (“forever”), from particular (“upon us”) to universal praise (“Hallelu-Yah”). The A→B progression—reason → open horizon → doxology—lays bare the psalm’s thesis in its tightest form: a history of hesed is the world’s invitation to trust God’s ’emet.
