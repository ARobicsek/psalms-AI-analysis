## Thematic Threads
1. Sevenfold 'voice of LORD' creates liturgical completeness - ritual magic number
2. Geographic progression: cosmic waters → Lebanon/Sirion → Kadesh → temple - territorial mapping
3. Rhetorical movement: cosmic summons → natural devastation → liturgical response → eternal kingship → covenantal peace
4. Imagery progression: divine beings → destructive power → playful animals → birth pangs → universal worship
5. Temporal complexity: present imperatives, ongoing storm description, past flood reference, eternal kingship, future blessing

## Notes for Synthesis
LEXICON: Rare storm vocabulary (חֹצֵ֗ב, יְחוֹלֵ֣ל), divine epithets (אֵֽל־הַכָּב֥וֹד), geographic terms (שִׂרְיֹ֗ן, מִדְבַּ֥ר קָדֵֽשׁ)
CONCORDANCE: Track 'mabbul' usage, 'voice of LORD' formula variations, 'sons of gods' occurrences
FIGURATIVE: Animal imagery for cosmic forces, birth metaphors, craftsman language for divine action
COMMENTARY: Verses with textual difficulties (v.1 LXX, v.6 'skip', v.9 temple location, v.10 flood reference)
