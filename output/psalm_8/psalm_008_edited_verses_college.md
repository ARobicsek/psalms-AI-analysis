**Verse 1**  
לַמְנַצֵּחַ עַל־הַגִּתִּית; מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד.  

Two quick pieces. First, לַמְנַצֵּחַ (“for the leader”) marks a performance direction—think “to the choirmaster.” Second, עַל־הַגִּתִּית (al‑haggittit) is the head-scratcher. It shows up only in Psalms 8, 81, and 84. Three live options:
- An instrument or tune from Gath (a Philistine city)—Rashi goes this way.
- A musical mode or choir assignment (Ibn Ezra; Radak mentions this too).
- The LXX reads “about the winepresses,” hinting at a harvest-festival tune.

Why care? Because Psalms 8, 81, 84 all mix creation/kingship themes with temple praise. So “gittith” likely signals a festive, communal setting where cosmic sovereignty and human vocation are on display. Also, this is “מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד,” “a psalm of David,” which in the Psalter often marks royal theology—useful to keep in mind when v. 6–9 democratize royal imagery for all humans.

Notice how little you need to make a world: a leader, a tune, and a question under the stars.

**Verse 2**  
יְהוָה אֲדֹנֵינוּ, מָה־אַדִּיר שִׁמְךָ בְּכׇל־הָאָרֶץ; אֲשֶׁר תְּנָה הוֹדְךָ עַל־הַשָּׁמָיִם.  

The double name—יְהוָה אֲדֹנֵינוּ (“YHWH, our Lord”)—holds intimacy (“our”) and sovereignty (“Lord”) together. The line “מָה־אַדִּיר” is wonder-speech: “How majestic!” The framing role of this sentence makes it an inclusio (bookend) for the psalm (see also v. 10).

The puzzle is אֲשֶׁר תְּנָה הוֹדְךָ עַל־הַשָּׁמָיִם. Hebrew allows two readings of תְּנָה here:
- “You have set Your splendor above the heavens” (past declaration).
- “Set Your splendor above the heavens!” (imperative—an exhortation).

Either way, “above the heavens” asserts transcendence: God is not the sky; God’s splendor outruns it. This matters because v. 4 will bring us back to the moon and stars as “finger-work.” The poet begins by placing God beyond the heavens before turning to their beauty. It keeps us from nature-worship while letting us adore nature as art.

Sound note: “מָה־אַדִּיר” pairs well with “הוֹדְךָ”—you can almost feel the loft in the vowels. Say it out loud.

**Verse 3**  
מִפִּי עוֹלְלִים וְיוֹנְקִים, יִסַּדְתָּ עֹז; לְמַעַן צֹרְרֶיךָ, לְהַשְׁבִּית אוֹיֵב וּמִתְנַקֵּם.  

The whiplash is intentional: from “above the heavens” to infant mouths. Two terms for tiny humans—עֺלְלִים (babes) and יוֹנְקִים (nurslings). “יִסַּדְתָּ” means “You have founded/laid a foundation.” עֹז usually means “strength/stronghold.” So: “Out of baby mouths, You established a fortress.” The LXX famously reads “praise,” but the Hebrew image is a fortress built out of babble. That’s delicious paradox: God defeats foes with what looks like weakness.

Who are the foes (צֹרְרֶיךָ… אוֹיֵב וּמִתְנַקֵּם)? In a creation psalm, probably not Philistines. Think cosmic opponents to God’s rule: chaos, arrogance, anything that pretends to be ultimate. Note the verb לְהַשְׁבִּית (“to silence/stop”). Infant praise “shuts down” the enemy.

Two quick intertexts:
- Proverbs 18:10 calls God’s name a “tower of strength” (מִגְדַּל־עֹז). Strength as a fortress is a biblical pattern.
- Matthew 21:16 quotes this verse when children shout “Hosanna” in the Temple. That follows the LXX “praise” reading. Our Hebrew still sings “fortress”—God’s “defense system” often looks like the world’s weakness.

Talmudic footnote: Sanhedrin 38b imagines angels citing our verse’s “what is man?” to argue against humanity. God tolerates the risk. So, yes, infant praise is risky too. God’s OK with that.

**Verse 4**  
כִּֽי־אֶרְאֶה שָׁמֶיךָ, מַעֲשֵׂה אֶצְבְּעֹתֶיךָ; יָרֵחַ וְכוֹכָבִים, אֲשֶׁר כּוֹנָנְתָּה.  

We move to first-person wonder: “When I behold Your heavens…” Two details jump out.

(1) “The work of Your fingers” (מַעֲשֵׂה אֶצְבְּעֹתֶיךָ). Not hands—fingers. Fingers suggest delicate craftsmanship (compare Ex 31:18: “written by the finger of God”). The heavens are filigree, not brute force.

(2) Moon and stars, not the sun. Likely because the poet is literally looking at the night sky. Also, Genesis 1 intentionally demythologizes sun and moon as mere “lights.” Psalm 8 goes smaller still: finger-work “set in place” (כּוֹנָנְתָּה—established firmly). Order, not combat, builds this world.

Liturgical aside: many Sephardi Kiddush Levanah rites recite verses about the moon’s establishment; some communities include Ps 8:4 before blessing the new moon. It fits: you’re literally gazing at “מַעֲשֵׂה אֶצְבְּעֹתֶיךָ.”

**Verse 5**  
מָה־אֱנוֹשׁ, כִּי־תִזְכְּרֶנּוּ; וּבֶן־אָדָם, כִּי תִפְקְדֶנּוּ.  

The question at the center. Two terms for “human”: אֱנוֹשׁ (frail mortal) and בֶּן־אָדָם (earthling). Two verbs of divine attentiveness:
- זָכַר (remember): often means remember-and-act (Ex 2:24; Ps 106:4).
- פָּקַד (visit/attend): purposeful visitation for care or judgment (Gen 21:1; Ex 32:34).

So the sense is: “What are frail mortals that You actively remember them, earthlings that You personally attend to them?” Under the stars, that is a fair question.

Counter-voice: Job 7:17–18 flips this into protest—“What is man that You make much of him… that You examine him every morning?” Same vocabulary, different mood. The Bible keeps both prayers: amazed gratitude (Psalm 8) and weary complaint (Job). That’s honest religion.

A favorite rabbinic story (Sanhedrin 38b): when the angels objected to creating such a risky species, God created us anyway and said, “Even to gray hairs I will bear.” Human dignity in the Bible rests not on our size or strength but on God’s stubborn attention.

**Verse 6**  
וַתְּחַסְּרֵהוּ מְעַט מֵאֱלֹהִים; וְכָבוֹד וְהָדָר תְּעַטְּרֵהוּ.  

Here’s the crux. מֵאֱלֹהִים can mean “God” or “divine beings/angels.” The LXX chose “angels,” which shaped Hebrews 2:7 (“for a little while lower than the angels”). The Hebrew allows either:
- “A little less than God” → maximal imago Dei; audacious.
- “A little less than angels” → humanity as near the angelic; classic Jewish medieval reading (Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Radak).

Either way, the effect is royal: “You crown him (תְּעַטְּרֵהוּ) with glory and majesty.” Those are God-words (e.g., Ps 104:1: “הוֹד וְהָדָר לָבָשְׁתָּ,” “You are clothed in splendor and majesty”). Psalm 8 spreads the coronation beyond kings to every human. It democratizes royal ideology: not “the king alone is God’s image,” but “humanity as such is crowned.” That has ethical teeth: dignity is universal.

The verb עָטַר (“to crown/encircle”) appears again in Ps 65:12: “You crown the year with Your goodness.” Crowns encircle. Here, dignity encircles human life—not self-bestowed, but given.

**Verse 7**  
תַּמְשִׁילֵהוּ בְּמַעֲשֵׂי יָדֶיךָ; כֹּל שַׁתָּה תַחַת־רַגְלָיו.  

Dominion installed. תַּמְשִׁילֵהוּ (Hiphil: “You cause him to rule”) stresses delegation—humans don’t seize authority; God grants it. “Over the work of Your hands”: the same creation whose heavens were finger-work is handed to human stewardship. The shift from fingers (v. 4) to hands (v. 7) is lovely: delicate heavens vs. entrusted earth.

“Everything under his feet” echoes royal imagery (cf. Ps 110:1: “Make your enemies a footstool”) but is defanged here: not enemies, creation itself is “underfoot,” i.e., placed within human responsibility. Footstool language also marks God’s presence (Ps 99:5; 132:7). Psalm 8 is careful: God remains King; human rule is vice-regency.

In short: image-of-God means stewardship, not entitlement.

**Verse 8**  
צֹנֶה וַאֲלָפִים כֻּלָּם; וְגַם בַּהֲמוֹת שָׂדָי.  

The dominion catalog begins with the animals humans live with:
- צֹנֶה (a rare form for צֹאן): flocks—sheep and goats.
- אֲלָפִים: cattle/oxen.
- “All of them”—broad coverage, likely also working animals (horses, donkeys, camels) by implication, as Radak notes.
- Then “also beasts of the field” (wildlife).

Rashi notes צֹנֶה likely carries the sense of managed flocks (as in Num 32:24 “גְּדֵרוֹת לְצֹנַאֲכֶם,” “pens for your flocks”). The movement is sensible: from most domesticated to less so. Dominion here is not about crushing; it’s about culture—tending, harnessing, learning.

Ethically, this line supports a stewardship reading of “rule”: the creatures nearest our livelihood (food, clothing, labor) are precisely those we’re bound to care for.

**Verse 9**  
צִפּוֹר שָׁמַיִם וּדְגֵי הַיָּם; עֹבֵר אׇרְחוֹת יַמִּים.  

Now sky and sea. “Birds of the heavens… fish of the sea.” The finale is poetic and fascinating: “whatever travels the paths of the seas.” Two good readings:
- Human navigation: by ingenuity we “pass through” sea-paths (ships!), extending dominion to the realm least natural to us.
- Marine migration: creatures literally travel sea “paths”—currents and routes known to whales and salmon long before sonar.

Either way, order has been inscribed on the waters. The line resonates with creation’s subduing of the watery deep (without naming any chaos monster here) and extends human agency into the far places. Fun fact: nineteenth-century oceanographer Matthew Maury credited “paths of the seas” with inspiring his study of ocean currents.

In short: Psalm 8 riffs on Genesis 1:26–28’s “rule over fish of the sea and birds of the heavens,” but adds the maritime flourish to make you feel it.

**Verse 10**  
יְהוָה אֲדֹנֵינוּ, מָה־אַדִּיר שִׁמְךָ בְּכׇל־הָאָרֶץ.  

Back to the opening line—the inclusio closes. Notice the small but meaningful omission: v. 2 added “Set Your splendor above the heavens”; v. 10 does not. Why? Because the poem has already shown it. After walking through infants, stars, a central question, a coronation, and a creaturely catalog, you don’t need to say “above the heavens” again. The journey has made God’s majesty “in all the earth” visible in a new way—through human vocation exercised within creation.

Liturgically, this line is a natural doxology—no surprise it shows up in High Holiday praise. Theologically, endings like this are invitations: go do the dominion well, and the earth will be full of “how majestic is Your name.” That’s a good last line to carry back into daylight from a starry night.
