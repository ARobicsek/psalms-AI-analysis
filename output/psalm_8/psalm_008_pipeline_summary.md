### Ugaritic & Ancient Near Eastern Parallels

*No Ugaritic parallels found.*

## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (9)

1. What is the precise meaning of 'elohim' in v. 6 - divine beings, angels, or God himself?
2. How does the distinction between 'work of Your fingers' (v. 4) and 'work of Your hands' (v. 7) function theologically?
3. What is the musical/liturgical significance of 'al-hagittith' in the superscription?
4. How does the enemy/avenger language in v. 3 relate to the creation theme of the rest of the psalm?
5. What creation theology connections exist between this psalm and Genesis 1:26-28?
6. How do the Ugaritic divine council parallels illuminate the 'little less than divine' language?
7. What is the relationship between the 'name' theology in the inclusio and ancient Near Eastern name theology?
8. How does the movement from 'mindful/remember' to 'visit/attend' in v. 5 function in Hebrew thought?
9. What is the significance of the progression from domestic animals to wild beasts to birds to fish in vv. 8-9?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (12)

1. Why does the psalm use 'fingers' for creating heavens (v. 4) but 'hands' for earth-works given to human dominion (v. 7)? Is this a deliberate theological distinction between divine artistry levels?
2. What is the meaning of 'elohim' in v. 6 - God, gods, divine beings, or angels? How does this choice affect the psalm's anthropology?
3. Why does v. 3 introduce enemy/avenger language in what is otherwise a creation meditation? Is there a cosmic conflict subtext?
4. What does the rare and possibly textually uncertain verb 'תְּנָה' in v. 2 actually mean? Why do translations vary so wildly (give, set, cover)?
5. Why does the closing inclusio (v. 10) deliberately omit the 'heavens' phrase from v. 2? What theological work does this truncation perform?
6. What is 'al-hagittith' in the superscription? Why do LXX translators render it as 'concerning winepresses'?
7. How do the two verbs in v. 5 ('remember' and 'visit/attend') differ semantically? Are they progressive stages of divine care?
8. Why are only moon and stars mentioned in v. 4, with no reference to the sun? Is this a nocturnal meditation, or is the omission theologically significant?
9. What is the significance of the elaborate phrase 'passes through the paths of the seas' (v. 9) rather than simply 'sea creatures'?
10. How does the infant/suckling imagery (v. 3) relate to the broader theme of human dignity through divine reversal?
11. Why does the domestic animal category get emphasized with 'all of them' (v. 8) but not the wild animals?
12. Is there a Genesis 1 creation order being followed or deliberately disrupted in the catalogue of vv. 8-9?
