## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (9)

1. What is the precise meaning of 'elohim' in v. 6 - divine beings, angels, or God himself?
2. How does the distinction between 'work of Your fingers' (v. 4) and 'work of Your hands' (v. 7) function theologically?
3. What is the musical/liturgical significance of 'al-hagittith' in the superscription?
4. How does the enemy/avenger language in v. 3 relate to the creation theme of the rest of the psalm?
5. What creation theology connections exist between this psalm and Genesis 1:26-28?
6. How do the Ugaritic divine council parallels illuminate the 'little less than divine' language?
7. What is the relationship between the 'name' theology in the inclusio and ancient Near Eastern name theology?
8. How does the movement from 'mindful/remember' to 'visit/attend' in v. 5 function in Hebrew thought?
9. What is the significance of the progression from domestic animals to wild beasts to birds to fish in vv. 8-9?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (7)

1. Why does the psalm shift from 'work of Your fingers' (v.4) to 'work of Your hands' (v.7) - what theological distinction does this anthropomorphic contrast serve?
2. What is the precise meaning of 'elohim' in v.6 - does it refer to God himself, divine beings, or angels, and how does this affect the psalm's anthropology?
3. How do 'infants and sucklings' establish 'strength' against 'enemies and avengers' in v.3, and how does this relate to the creation theme?
4. What are the 'paths of the seas' in v.9 - ancient geographical knowledge, mythological imagery, or poetic metaphor for divine order in chaos?
5. Why does the inclusio in v.10 omit the heavens reference present in v.2 - is this intentional narrowing to earth after the cosmic meditation?
6. What is the significance of the verb progression 'mindful/visit' (zakar/paqad) in v.5 - do these represent different levels of divine attention?
7. How does the mysterious 'gittith' in the superscription relate to the psalm's themes, and why did early translators interpret it so differently?
