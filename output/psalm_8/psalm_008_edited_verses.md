**Verse 1**

The superscription—לַמְנַצֵּחַ עַל־הַגִּתִּית מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד—presents two puzzles that are exegetically modest and imaginatively suggestive. First, הַגִּתִּית (hagittith) is unknown in meaning. BDB lists three occurrences (Psalm 8; 81; 84) and offers the standard options: an instrument or tune from Gath (Rashi: “a musical instrument that came from Gath”), a melody associated with wine-pressing (LXX: “ὑπὲρ τῶν ληνῶν,” “concerning the wine-presses”), or a guild designation (Ibn Ezra connects it to Obed-Edom the Gittite). Each reading tugs the ear in a different direction. If “Gittite,” it locates the psalm in the borderland between Israel and Philistia and recalls the ark’s sojourn in a Gittite’s house (2 Sam 6:10–11). If “wine-press,” it would link the hymn to autumnal festivity, when threshing floors and presses sang with labor. The fact that Psalm 84—“How lovely are your dwellings”—also bears “gittith” may point to a performance tradition rather than a semantic key.

Second, the ascription “of David” is not data but voice. To read the psalm “in David’s mouth” is to hear not only a shepherd under stars but a king confessing scale: even the enthroned are small under the moon. Malbim hears in the superscription a polemic against philosophies that belittle man in view of the heavens; Meiri hears a counter-argument to skepticism about providence. The title is not a code to be cracked so much as a set of stage directions: sing this with strings tuned to astonishment.

Formally, the superscriptions are part of the psalm’s literary surface; they belong to the poem’s ritual life. “For the leader” marks it for liturgical performance; “upon the gittith” situates its sound among other temple songs. The tradition’s uncertainty about gittith is itself fitting. Psalm 8 is about the limits of human mastery; it begins with a musical term that we can name but cannot confidently define.

**Verse 2**

“יְהוָה אֲדֹנֵינוּ מָה־אַדִּיר שִׁמְךָ בְּכָל־הָאָרֶץ, אֲשֶׁר תְּנָה הוֹדְךָ עַל־הַשָּׁמָיִם.” The double divine address is rare; the concordance notes only here, verse 10, and Nehemiah 10:30 (“…all the commandments of YHWH our Lord…”). Read aloud, it binds the unpronounceable name (YHWH) to the intimate “our Lord,” sovereignty framed as relationship. “Name” (שֵׁם) in Hebrew is character-in-action; God’s name is God present, not merely labeled.

Two phrases matter. First, “how majestic” (מָה־אַדִּיר). The interrogative מָה functions here as exclamatory (“how…!”), not as a question. אַדִּיר resonates with nobility and might; it is used of rulers and of God. The line’s claim is not that the earth is majestic but that God’s manifest name is: the earth is the theater, not the actor.

Second, “אֲשֶׁר תְּנָה הוֹדְךָ עַל־הַשָּׁמָיִם.” The Masoretic vocalization תְּנָה is striking. As-is, it looks like an imperative (“Give your splendor upon the heavens”), which jars grammatically—who would the psalmist be commanding? Many take תְּנָה here as a poetic infinitive, functioning like a perfect: “that you have set” (so many modern translations), or emend (with BDB’s note) to נתתָּה (“you have given/set”). The LXX rephrases: “ὅτι ἐπῇρας τὴν μεγαλοπρέπειάν σου ὑπεράνω τῶν οὐρανῶν” (“for you have raised your majesty above the heavens”), hearing a causal “for.” The poetry tolerates both: God’s splendor stands over (“above”) the sky, and therefore God’s name is majestic “in all the earth.” The line creates the psalm’s verticality: the heavens are not God’s ceiling but the floor of God’s glory; earth is where that fact is confessed.

Liturgically, communities often pair this verse with Psalm 113:4 (“The LORD is high above all nations; His glory is above the heavens”). The juxtaposition is hermeneutic: highness is known in low places; the name’s “majesty in all the earth” is the human side of “glory above the heavens.”

**Verse 3**

“מִפִּי עוֹלְלִים וְיֹנְקִים יִסַּדְתָּ עֹז, לְמַעַן צוֹרְרֶיךָ; לְהַשְׁבִּית אוֹיֵב וּמִתְנַקֵּם.” The line balances fragility and force with a craftsman’s touch. עוֹלְלִים (“infants”) and יֹנְקִים (“nurslings”) are the least articulate of humans—mouths that barely form syllables. Yet “from their mouths” God “has founded” (יִסַּדְתָּ) עֹז (“strength”). The verb יסד is architectural—lay foundations (1 Kgs 6:37), erect pillars. The noun עֹז elsewhere names fortress might or the strength of God’s arm. The LXX reads the noun as αἶνος (“praise”). It is not a mistranslation so much as a construal: the strength God establishes is praise. Rabbinic and later liturgical uses tacitly follow the Greek’s hint (Sotah 30b; Matt 21:16), but the Hebrew also works: the very fact that the helpless bless confounds the calculus of power.

The purpose clauses intensify the paradox: “because of your foes, to make the enemy and avenger cease.” The “foes” are unnamed; in the poetry of the Psalms they are often personal and cosmic at once. Here, in a creation hymn, the line may echo the old motif of taming chaos—strength established in order to silence the adversaries of order. Either way, the means is disarmingly gentle: not new force, but voiced wonder.

Figurative patterning matters. The “mouth” is an organ of agency throughout biblical literature: speech creates, blesses, curses, deceives. Here it builds. The line’s structure is classic parallelism with intensification (what Robert Alter calls “the seconding sequence”): from “adversaries” (צוֹרְרֶיךָ) to “enemy and avenger” (אוֹיֵב… מִתְנַקֵּם), from “found” to “make cease.” The effect is a quiet crescendo. Liturgy makes this concrete by putting the verse into the mouths of worshipers during the Kedushah of Yom Kippur: we are the infants, and our praise is the world’s scaffolding.

**Verse 4**

“כִּי־אֶרְאֶה שָׁמֶיךָ, מַעֲשֵׂה אֶצְבְּעֹתֶיךָ; יָרֵחַ וְכוֹכָבִים, אֲשֶׁר כוֹנָנְתָּה.” The verse swings from the communal to the first person: “when I see.” The psalmist is not a theorist but a witness. The heavens are “the work of your fingers.” Elsewhere “hands” fashion sea and land (Psalm 95:5) and humanity (Psalm 119:73); “fingers” brings the scale down to craft. In the story of Sinai, “the finger of God” writes (Exod 31:18; Deut 9:10); in Egypt, the plague-confounded magicians recognize “the finger of God” (Exod 8:15). Our poet layers creation with those resonances: the heavens are written and wrought with that same precision.

“Moon and stars” likely indicates a nocturnal setting. Ibn Ezra and Radak draw the obvious inference: by day one lamp hides the crowd; by night the host appears. The verb כוֹנֵן (“establish/set firm”), used here in the second person perfect (“you set in place”), is a term of durability; it is used of thrones (Psalm 93:2), plans (Prov 16:3), and the earth itself (Psalm 24:2). The sky’s dazzling contingency is acknowledged—but its order is not random. The effect is to heighten the paradox of the next verse: in a firm world, what are we?

Figuratively, the verse participates in a common scriptural behavior: translating abstraction into body. God here has fingers. This is not crude anthropomorphism but reverent concreteness. Biblical poetics trusts that we learn God through images we know: rock, shepherd, king, father, crafter. The same tactic will be used for humanity’s role (“under his feet,” v. 7). The world becomes thinkable because it is pictured.

**Verse 5**

“מָה־אֱנוֹשׁ כִּי תִזְכְּרֶנּוּ, וּבֶן־אָדָם כִּי תִפְקְדֶנּוּ.” The paired nouns are not redundant. אֱנוֹשׁ (enosh) often names humanity in its weakness and mortality (Job 4:17; Psalm 103:15). בֶּן־אָדָם (“son of Adam/earth”) underscores origin and kind. The verbs move from זָכַר (“remember”) to פָּקַד (“visit/attend”). In biblical usage, “remembering” is not mental retrieval only; it implies decisive attention (Gen 8:1; Exod 2:24). “Visiting” is stronger still: God “visits” Sarah (Gen 21:1); God “visits” in punishment (Exod 32:34). The structure is staircase parallelism: the second colon repeats the sense with an elevated verb. God does not merely keep us in mind; He shows up.

The verse has a long rabbinic afterlife. Shabbat 88b–89a imagines the ministering angels citing it to argue that Torah belongs in heaven. God’s reply is to insist that only creatures who struggle with theft, desire, and death need Torah; angels do not. The verse thus becomes a site where human limitation is the very reason for divine attention. Liturgy, in Kiddush Levanah, often places these words under a fresh moon; they become a monthly rehearsal of wonder.

Concordance patterns reinforce the point. In Psalms, זָכַר is often paired with covenant or steadfast love (Psalm 98:3; 105:8), while פָּקַד frequently marks decisive change—deliverance or judgment (Psalm 65:10; 89:33). The poet borrows that valence to say: the One who manages galaxies remembers and acts for dust.

**Verse 6**

“וַתְּחַסְּרֵהוּ מְעַט מֵאֱלֹהִים; וְכָבוֹד וְהָדָר תְּעַטְּרֵהוּ.” The line is as daring as Hebrew allows. The verb חִסֵּר (“to make lacking”) with מְעַט (“a little”) sets the limit: humanity is “a little less than אֱלֹהִים.” Does that mean “God,” “gods,” “angels,” or “divine beings”? Rashi and the LXX prefer “angels.” BDB notes the range of אֱלֹהִים in Tanakh (rulers/judges; divine ones; God). The choice matters less than the claim’s thrust: humans are not divine, but they are not mere beasts. The next clause clarifies: “with glory and splendor (כָבוֹד וְהָדָר) you crown him.” The verb עִטֵּר (Piel) means “to crown/adorn.” The phrase “glory and splendor” is liturgical shorthand for the radiance of kingship; it describes God (Psalm 104:1) and the king (Psalm 21:4). Here it rests on humanity as such.

Crown language in Psalms also carries ethical freight. In Psalm 103:4, God “crowns you with steadfast love and mercy.” The crown, then, is not licensed exception but moral endowment. Malbim reads the verse through four “causes” (material, formal, efficient, final), insisting that the human spirit’s affinity with the immaterial makes us kingly; Radak, more soberly, sees in the soul’s incorporeality our kinship with angels, with the body marking the “lack.” Both agree on the result: the crown is a vocation.

Figurative parallels help. Crowning is a standard biblical metaphor for honor and appointment (Psalm 65:12; Prov 4:9). Here its collective application is striking. This is not a royal psalm ennobling a single David; it is an anthropological psalm ennobling all Adams and Eves. The theology is not “humanism” in a modern key; it is mandate: you are less than God, and yet crowned. Now act accordingly.

**Verse 7**

“תַּמְשִׁילֵהוּ בְּמַעֲשֵׂי יָדֶיךָ; כֹּל שַׁתָּה תַחַת־רַגְלָיו.” The verb משל in this stem means “to cause to rule” or “appoint as ruler.” It is used for human kings (Gen 37:8; 1 Kgs 5:1) and for God’s reign (Psalm 103:19). Here it names delegated sovereignty: God makes the human creature ruler “over the works of your hands.” The royal idiom continues: “you set everything under his feet.” In royal iconography from Egypt to Assyria, enemies literally lie beneath the king’s feet. Our psalm reframes the idiom for creation: the “all” to be placed underfoot will be named in the next verses and consists of animals, birds, fish.

Two clarifications belong here. First, “rule” in the biblical lexicon is not carte blanche. Genesis 1:26–28 gives the triad—fish, birds, animals—and Genesis 2:15 adds the mode: “to serve it and to guard it.” The mandate is custodial. Second, the Hebrew phrase “works of your hands” recalls v. 4’s “work of your fingers,” tying God’s craft to human responsibility. If God’s “fingers” wrote the heavens, God’s “hands” fashioned the realm we directly govern. The poet’s anthropomorphisms are not accidents; they narrate relation.

Figurative language database parallels for “under the feet” confirm the idiom of subjugation (e.g., Psalm 110:1; Joshua 10:24). Our context, however, removes the battle scene. The animals are not enemies; they are entrusted subjects. The verse thus prepares a catalog not of war but of stewardship.

**Verse 8**

“צֹנֶה וַאֲלָפִים כֻּלָּם; וְגַם בַּהֲמוֹת שָׂדָי.” Domestic first, then wild. צֹנֶה is a textual curiosity, likely a collective for צֹאן (flock—sheep and goats). אֲלָפִים are “cattle/oxen,” the herds of agrarian life. “All of them” (כֻּלָּם) underscores scope. Then the escalation: “and also the beasts of the field” (wild animals). The merism (naming poles to imply the whole) is a favorite biblical device; here the poles are domesticated and untamed. BDB observes that בַּהֲמוֹת can be generic “beasts” or, in other contexts, specific (cf. “Behemoth” in Job 40). Here the context is simple: everything that moves on land, from the animals we harness to those we fear, falls under human governance.

The sequence mirrors Genesis 1:24–28, where categories—beasts, creeping things, wild animals—are named. Our psalm paraphrases that list in the idiom of Near Eastern life. It is no accident that the domestic animals lead. Food, clothing, agriculture—these are the first theaters of human rule. Radak notes that the mention of these first emphasizes human dependence and partnership (“grown up with him, ready for his work, food, and clothing”). The wild follows, not as a conquest agenda but as acknowledgment that human intelligence extends beyond the barn.

The figurative language database notes that such catalogs function to map a whole by enumeration. The pattern shows up in Psalm 104’s ecology and in Job 38–39’s zoological tour. Psalm 8’s list is shorter and more pointed: it is not a natural history; it is a coronation register.

**Verse 9**

“צִפּוֹר שָׁמַיִם וּדְגֵי הַיָּם; עֹבֵר אֳרְחוֹת יַמִּים.” The vertical axis completes the map: above and below human habitation, sky and sea. The construct “birds of the heavens” (צִפּוֹר שָׁמַיִם) and “fish of the sea” (דְגֵי הַיָּם) echoes Genesis 1:26. The final phrase is deliciously terse: “passing through the paths of the seas.” Who or what is passing? The Hebrew can refer to humans traversing sea routes (by ship) or to fish following their migrations. Ibn Ezra notes both options and favors navigation; Radak, too, mentions shipbuilding. The image works either way. If it is fish, even their hidden tracks are comprehensible and therefore governable. If it is human ships, then the “paths” are literal—the lanes cut through chaos by human craft.

The phrase “paths of the seas” (אֳרְחוֹת יַמִּים) is a hapax—the only time this exact formulation appears. Elsewhere, “way/paths” metaphorize moral life (Psalm 1:6; Deut 5:30). Here it is world-making: a moral creature carving roads upon the unroaded. In the ancient imagination the sea (Yam) is the emblem of unruliness; in Israel’s hymnody, God tames it (Psalm 89:10; Job 26:12). Psalm 8’s line is a quiet reprise: human rule extends, by God’s leave, even where the world once raged most.

Figurative parallels: Job 38:16 (“Have you entered into the springs of the sea?”) and Psalm 107:23–30 (seafarers who “see the deeds of the LORD”) suggest that sailing is a spiritual pedagogy. Our psalm is less dramatic: it states as fact what those narratives show as adventure. Dominion includes the skills of passage.

**Verse 10**

“יְהוָה אֲדֹנֵינוּ מָה־אַדִּיר שִׁמְךָ בְּכָל־הָאָרֶץ.” We are back where we began, but not unchanged. The final line drops the earlier “above the heavens.” After the ascent through praise, infants, and stars, and after the descent through crown and catalog, the last word is earth. That is not a diminution; it is the point. Divine majesty is not a secret kept in the upper rooms but a name enacted in the lower ones. Radak hears this as a return to praise after recounting God’s kindness; Meiri hears confirmation that providence, not clockwork, governs the world.

Formally, the inclusio does more than frame; it interprets. In biblical poetry, repeated lines carry the freight of all that lies between. The last “how majestic” is thicker than the first. It means: the God whose splendor is “above the heavens” has appointed mortals to rule wisely under the heavens; therefore, the majesty of the name is seen where we live. In synagogue usage, the verse often signals the turn from private request to public sanctification—precisely the psalm’s movement: from the self under stars to the community under a name.

The final quiet is the psalm’s theology. It does not answer “What is man?” with measurements. It shows a crown and a list, and it leaves us with a sentence we can speak. The dignity the psalm bestows is not an abstraction; it is the capacity to say this line and then live as if it were true.
