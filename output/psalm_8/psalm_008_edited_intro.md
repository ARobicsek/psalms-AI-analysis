Psalm 8 reads like a night walk under a clear sky. The poet looks up, counts nothing and everything, and then asks the question that never ages: “What is man?” The psalm answers not with an ontological definition but a choreography—how God’s name moves from above the heavens to “all the earth,” how human beings are set within that dance, crowned, tasked, and made capable of answering back.

The frame is unmistakable. The poem begins and ends with the same exclamation—יהוה אֲדֹנֵינוּ מָה־אַדִּיר שִׁמְךָ בְּכָל־הָאָרֶץ, “YHWH our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth” (vv. 2, 10). That repeated line is an inclusio—bookends that bracket and illuminate everything between. The second clause of v. 2 adds a height the last line withholds: אֲשֶׁר תְּנָה הוֹדְךָ עַל־הַשָּׁמָיִם. The Masoretic text literally reads “who give/set your splendor upon the heavens.” The form תְּנָה is unusual; many (following BDB) take it as an archaic imperative or as a poetic infinitive used for the perfect “you have set,” and some emend to נתתָּה. The Septuagint (LXX) smooths differently (“for you have lifted your glory above the heavens”). However we vocalize, the sense is clear: the divine splendor is not constrained by the dome overhead. It outruns the sky. Yet the psalm will end with the name’s majesty registered not “above the heavens” but “in all the earth.” The arc is downward without diminution: transcendence addressing dust.

Verse 3 is a hinge of surprise: “From the mouths of babes and sucklings you have founded strength [עֹז] because of your foes, to put an end to enemy and avenger.” The Hebrew עֹז normally means “strength” or “fortress.” The LXX reads αἶνος, “praise,” a translation that migrated into later interpretation (e.g., Matthew 21:16). Rabbinic tradition (Sotah 30b) pictures even infants singing at the Sea. The point in either case is paradox: divine rule is secured not by battering rams but by unembarrassed praise; the world is stabilized not by our big technologies but by littleness—mouths that can only bless. The psalm says this in the compact rhetoric that biblical poetry prefers: parallel cola—paired lines in which the second intensifies or completes the first—do the work of argument without footnotes.

Then the poet looks up. “When I behold your heavens, the work of your fingers; the moon and stars you set in place…” Fingers, not hands. Elsewhere God’s “hands” fashion sea and land (Psalm 95:5); here the smaller digit suggests craft: the “finger of God” writes on stone (Exod 31:18; Deut 9:10) and overwhelms magicians (Exod 8:15). The diction quietly insists that what overwhelms us is for God fine work. Night sharpens this eyesight: the verse names moon and stars and omits the sun. Ibn Ezra and Radak note that by day one light dominates; by night a “very great host” appears. The psalmist’s scale—the tiny human under a limitless array—triggers the great question.

“What is man that you remember him, and the son of man that you visit him?” (v. 5). The Hebrew tightens the contrast. אֱנוֹשׁ is humanity under the sign of frailty; בֶּן־אָדָם emphasizes our earth-origin. The verbs move from זָכַר (remember)—in biblical Hebrew often an active, covenantal attention (e.g., Exod 2:24)—to פָּקַד (visit/attend), the verb used for divine intervention, gracious or punitive (Gen 21:1; Jer 15:15). The line, then, is not philosophical wonder that we are noticed at all but astonishment at a God who remembers and visits, who converts memory into care.

Verse 6, the crux, answers with a crown: “You made him a little less than אֱלֹהִים, and with glory and splendor you crowned him.” What is אֱלֹהִים here? Rashi, the LXX (ἀγγέλων), and much of medieval exegesis read “angels.” Others take “God” or “divine beings,” hearing behind the Hebrew the plurals of the ancient council. The psalm’s logic allows either, but two points stand out. First, the crowning is not a private exaltation but a vocation, as the next verses show. Second, the diction “glory and splendor” (כָּבוֹד וְהָדָר) normally adorns God (Psalm 104:1). Here it is loaned. The crown is derivative: an image and task, not a transfer of essence.

That task is royal. “You make him rule over the works of your hands; you set all things under his feet” (v. 7). The idiom “under the feet” belongs to the ancient Near East’s grammar of sovereignty; reliefs show conquered peoples literally beneath a king’s soles. Genesis 1:26–28 gives the canonical charter: rule the fish, the birds, the animals—creation’s grammar oriented toward stewardship. Our psalm makes the list explicit: flocks and cattle (צֹנֶה וַאֲלָפִים), wild beasts (בַּהֲמוֹת שָׂדָי), birds of the heavens, fish of the sea—“whatever passes through the paths of the seas” (עֹבֵר אֳרְחוֹת יַמִּים). The form צֹנֶה is odd; it seems to carry צֹאן (“flock”) as a collective. The phrase “paths of the seas” is a one-off in the Bible, a hapax; it may glance at shipping lanes or currents, or poetically flatten the old chaos imagery: even the sea has roads; even the untamable has been given habit and limit. Job 38 asks, “Have you walked in the recesses of the deep?” Our psalm quietly answers: we have learned to pass along its ways. Dominion here is not domination so much as comprehension and harnessing—“to serve it and to guard it” (Gen 2:15). Malbim, with nineteenth-century brio, sees humanity as a “microcosm,” the summed image of the macrocosm; Radak calls human reason itself a form of rule over the higher motions.

The psalm’s structure is elegant. Many have described it as a large-scale chiasm (an A-B-C-B′-A′ pattern). A: the opening praise (v. 2); B: God’s glory above the heavens (vv. 2–4); C: the central human question (vv. 5–6); B′: human rule on earth (vv. 7–9); A′: the closing praise (v. 10). The ordering is not merely aesthetic. God’s majesty over the heavens and humanity’s dominion under heaven mirror one another. The “name” is majestic “in all the earth” not because earth is grand but because on earth, frail beings are addressed and appointed and, in turn, become capable of answering in praise. Psalm 8, in other words, is a position paper on scale: significance is not measured by size. It is measured by relation, by the fact of being remembered and visited.

Rabbinic reception keeps this tension alive. Shabbat 88b–89a famously imagines angels arguing against giving the Torah to flesh and blood, citing our verse (“What is man…?”). God insists. The Torah belongs on earth. Sotah 30b hears the infants at the sea; Psalm 8:3 thus becomes a proof that praise from the small remakes the world. In liturgy, the opening exclamation is often placed where private devotion shifts to communal proclamation. That is no accident. The psalm understands that the nobility of the human creature is not in our ability to look down from the heavens but in our responsibility to bless from the ground.

If there is a single line to carry out of the night, it is the first and last: “YHWH our Lord.” The pairing of the ineffable name with “our Lord” (אֲדֹנֵינוּ) is rare; it binds transcendence to intimacy, sovereignty to possession. The psalm will not let us have one without the other. The God whose splendor is “over the heavens” chooses that his name be known “in all the earth,” and he entrusts that work to mouths that begin as nursing.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

#### Full psalm

In many communities the entire psalm is recited in Yom Kippur Katan, the minor fast observed on the eve of Rosh Ḥodesh. Its movement from cosmic contemplation to human accountability fits the penitential mood: under the moon and stars, we ask “What is man…?” and answer by recommitting to our calling.

#### Key verses

“יְהוָה אֲדֹנֵינוּ מָה־אַדִּיר שִׁמְךָ בְּכׇל־הָאָרֶץ” (“O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is Your name throughout the earth,” vv. 2, 10) functions in the Siddur Edot HaMizrach as a bridge from private prayer to public sanctification. Before the Kaddish, congregations often recite: “רָם עַל־כָּל־גּוֹיִם יְהוָה, עַל הַשָּׁמַיִם כְּבוֹדוֹ. יְהוָה אֲדֹנֵינוּ מָה אַדִּיר שִׁמְךָ בְּכָל הָאָרֶץ.” (“The LORD is exalted above all nations, His glory above the heavens. O LORD our Lord, how majestic is Your name in all the earth.”) The placement underscores the psalm’s thesis: God’s “above” is known “below,” in the voice of a gathered people.

“מִפִּי עוֹלְלִים וְיֹנְקִים יִסַּדְתָּ עֹז” (“From the mouths of infants and sucklings you founded strength,” v. 3) appears in High Holiday piyyutim within Kedushah on Yom Kippur, linking childlike praise to the establishment of holiness. The Hebrew often echoes: “קְדֻשָּׁה וָעֹז תְּיַסֵּד כְּמִפִּי עוֹלְלִים…” (“You established holiness and strength as from the mouths of infants…”). The line’s liturgical use leans into the LXX’s “praise” without abandoning the Hebrew’s “strength”: praise is power.

Verses 4–5 (“כִּי־אֶרְאֶה שָׁמֶיךָ… מָה אֱנוֹשׁ…”) often frame Kiddush Levanah (sanctification of the new moon) in Edot HaMizrach, where the community literally stands beneath the “work of [God’s] fingers.” The ritual performance makes the rhetoric concrete.

#### Phrases

“יְהוָה אֲדֹנֵינוּ מָה אַדִּיר שִׁמְךָ” recurs in Rosh Hashanah’s Musaf (Malchuyot/Kedushah), sometimes paired with Zechariah’s “וְהָיָה יְהוָה לְמֶלֶךְ עַל־כָּל הָאָרֶץ” (“The LORD shall be King over all the earth”), clarifying that Psalm 8’s “majesty” is a kingship shared with, and manifest through, human recognition. Hoshanot on Hoshana Rabbah weave the line into processional pleas: praise turning outward into petition—again, the psalm’s logic at work.
