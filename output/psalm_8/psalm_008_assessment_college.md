# Editorial Assessment (College Edition) - Psalm 8

What’s strong here: the draft knows the Hebrew very well, sees the poem’s big arc (praise → human smallness → human dignity → praise), and brings in great sources (Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Radak; LXX; Job 7:17–18; ANE royal ideology; Genesis 1). It also notices fine-grained details like “fingers” (אֶצְבָּעוֹת) vs “hands” (יָדַיִם) and the ambiguity of מֵאֱלֹהִים.

What needs work for first-year college students: the tone sometimes drifts toward academic or homiletic density. Terms like inclusio, Hiphil, and LXX appear without brisk, student-friendly definitions. There are lots of claims about liturgy and parallels, but relatively few concrete Hebrew quotations from those prayers or from the “comparative verses” being cited. For this audience, every interesting claim should be demonstrated with the Hebrew (they can read it!) and a crisp English gloss.

Specific revisions to reach excellence:
- Define every technical term on first use (inclusio, chiasm, Hiphil, merism, etc.).
- Show, don’t just tell: quote the parallel verses you invoke (e.g., Job 7:17–18; Ps 110:1; Prov 18:10).
- Tighten grammar notes (e.g., תְּנָה) into clear, practical options with why-they-matter.
- Make the “why” explicit: Why “fingers” here? Why omit the sun? Why start with baby mouths?
- Liturgy: add brief, accurate, quoted examples from widely used rites; explain what the usage does in prayer.
- Keep the voice conversational (coffee shop, not dissertation), with occasional light humor.

Missed opportunities:
- The Talmudic “angel debate” on מה־אֱנוֹשׁ (Sanhedrin 38b/Shabbat 88b) is gold for showing how Israel wrestled with the “risk” of humanity—bring it in briefly and explain its point.
- Quote a few “strength/fortress” (עֹז) verses to clarify why LXX read “praise.”
- Use the Related Psalms (84:1’s “על-הגיתית,” 144:1’s “אֶצְבְּעוֹתַי”) to reinforce patterns with actual text.

Overall goal: sharper definitions + more Hebrew evidence + clearer “why this matters.”
