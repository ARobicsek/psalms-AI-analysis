# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 8

The draft gets many big things right. It hears the psalm’s music of paradox—human smallness against cosmic grandeur—and it sees how the repeated line “YHWH our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth” frames, and in some sense resolves, the tension. It notices the poet’s anthropomorphic delicacy—the heavens as “work of your fingers”—and it draws useful lines to Genesis 1 and to rabbinic reception of “What is man?” The verse-by-verse notes are often thoughtful, and they avoid both bombast and jargon.

Still, there are gaps and places to sharpen. The textual crux in v. 2—תְּנָה (“give/set”)—deserves closer attention, including the BDB suggestion that many read נתתָה (“you have set”), and the LXX’s different rendering. Verse 3’s עֹז (“strength”) should be weighed against the LXX’s αἶνος (“praise”), a Second Temple-era construal that later shaped rabbinic and Christian reception (Sotah 30b; Matthew 21:16). The commentary underuses the lexicon and concordance data on זָכַר/פָּקַד (“remember/visit”) in v. 5, which could make the argument about degrees of divine attention more concrete. The “fingers/hands” observation is suggestive but needs nuance; better to show the artistry of etzbaʿ (“finger”) elsewhere (Exod 8:15; 31:18; Deut 9:10) without overbuilding a system.

More broadly: the essay mentions inclusio but misses the psalm’s chiastic architecture (framed praise; heavens above; human question at the center; dominion catalog below), and it doesn’t reckon with the divine council resonance of אֱלֹהִים (v. 6) beyond citing the “angels” option. Radak, Ibn Ezra, Malbim, and Meiri have sharp lines that can be woven in, and Torah Temimah preserves aggadic uses (Shabbat 88b–89a; Sotah 30b) that clarify reception. The liturgical section is informative but unfocused; it should be streamlined with clear headings, quotations in Hebrew, and brief theological comments on why each liturgical reuse matters.

Figurative language could be tied more concretely to parallels (e.g., “under his feet” as an ANE subjugation idiom; “paths of the seas” alongside Job 38). Phonetic analysis is not essential here and should be used sparingly, only where sound shapes sense. With these adjustments—tighter textual work, fuller use of classical sources, a clearer liturgical map, and a more disciplined style—the commentary will meet the high bar you’ve set.
