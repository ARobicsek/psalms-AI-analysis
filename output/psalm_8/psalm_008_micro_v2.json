    "Why does v. 3 introduce enemy/avenger language in what is otherwise a creation meditation? Is there a cosmic conflict subtext?",
    "What does the rare and possibly textually uncertain verb 'תְּנָה' in v. 2 actually mean? Why do translations vary so wildly (give, set, cover)?",
    "Why does the closing inclusio (v. 10) deliberately omit the 'heavens' phrase from v. 2? What theological work does this truncation perform?",
    "What is 'al-hagittith' in the superscription? Why do LXX translators render it as 'concerning winepresses'?",
    "How do the two verbs in v. 5 ('remember' and 'visit/attend') differ semantically? Are they progressive stages of divine care?",
    "Why are only moon and stars mentioned in v. 4, with no reference to the sun? Is this a nocturnal meditation, or is the omission theologically significant?",
    "What is the significance of the elaborate phrase 'passes through the paths of the seas' (v. 9) rather than simply 'sea creatures'?",
    "How does the infant/suckling imagery (v. 3) relate to the broader theme of human dignity through divine reversal?",
    "Why does the domestic animal category get emphasized with 'all of them' (v. 8) but not the wild animals?",
