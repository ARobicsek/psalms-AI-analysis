The phrase **שֹׁפְטֵי אָרֶץ** (judges of the earth) from Psalm 2:10 appears primarily in **Pesukei D'Zimrah** and related praise sections of **Shacharit** across all three major traditions (Ashkenaz, Sefard, and Edot HaMizrach), recited on both weekdays and Shabbat. The phrase appears most prominently in **Psalm 148** (Ashkenaz tradition) within the context of universal praise: *"מַלְכֵי־אֶֽרֶץ וְכָל־לְאֻמִּים שָׂרִים וְכָל־שֹׁפְטֵי אָֽרֶץ"* ("Kings of the earth and all peoples, princes and all judges of the earth [shall praise the Lord]"), where earthly rulers are summoned to join in cosmic praise of God. It also appears in **Ashrei** (Psalm 145) contexts and in the **Yehi Kevod** section (Ashkenaz), as well as in the **Blessing of the Trees** (Edot HaMizrach), functioning as part of the liturgical call for all creation and authority to acknowledge divine sovereignty during the morning service's opening praise sections.

# Liturgical Usage Summary

The phrase **עִבְדוּ אֶת־יְהֹוָה** (ivdu et-Adonai, "serve the Lord") from Psalm 100:2 appears in two distinct prayer contexts within Edot HaMizrach (Eastern/Mizrahi tradition):

**1. Kabbalat Shabbat (Welcoming the Sabbath):**
The phrase appears in the liturgical recitation of Psalm 100 during Kabbalat Shabbat services on Friday evening. The full verse reads: "עִבְדוּ אֶת־יְהֹוָה בְּשִׂמְחָה בֹּאוּ לְפָנָיו בִּרְנָנָה" ("Serve the Lord with gladness; come before Him with joyful song"). This occurs as part of the extended psalm recitations that frame the transition into Shabbat.

**2. Pesukei D'Zimra (Verses of Song):**
The same phrase recurs in the Pesukei D'Zimra section of Shacharit (morning service), where Psalm 100 is recited as part of the preparatory hymns preceding the formal prayer service. This appears on both Shabbat and weekday mornings within the Edot HaMizrach tradition.

The phrase emphasizes joyful service to God and appears specifically in contexts celebrating divine sovereignty and communal worship.

--- LITURGICAL SUMMARY ---
The phrase "אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב" (Elohei Ya'akov, "God of Jacob") appears predominantly in the Amidah blessing across all daily services (Shacharit, Mincha, and Maariv) as well as in Musaf and Neilah, where it forms part of the Patriarchs (Avot) blessing recited in all three traditions (Ashkenaz, Sefard, and Edot HaMizrach). The blessing reads: "בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה ה׳ אֱלֹהֵי אַבְרָהָם אֱלֹהֵי יִצְחָק וֵאלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב" ("Blessed are You, Lord, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob"), establishing the covenantal connection to the patriarchs. Beyond the Amidah, the phrase appears in Pesukei D'Zimrah (particularly in Psalm 81:5 recited on weekdays and festivals), in Ashrei, in various Selichot, and in festival-specific liturgies including Rosh Chodesh, Sukkot, and Purim, making it one of the most frequently invoked divine appellations in Jewish prayer across all occasions and traditions.

The phrase **"Tov Adonai l'ma'oz b'yom tzarah"** (טוֹב יְהֹוָה לְמָעוֹז בְּיוֹם צָרָה, "The Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble") from Psalm 20:2 appears exclusively in the **Selichot (penitential prayers) of the Edot HaMizrach tradition**, recited during **weekday Shacharit services on communal fast days**.

# Liturgical Summary: לְמַעַן שְׁמוֹ (L'ma'an Shemo, "For His Name's Sake")

The phrase **לְמַעַן שְׁמוֹ** (l'ma'an shemo, "for His name's sake") appears predominantly in the **Patriarchs (Avot) blessing of the Amidah**, recited across all daily services (Shacharit, Mincha, and Maariv) as well as Musaf and Neilah throughout the Jewish calendar year. The representative liturgical formulation reads: **"וּמֵבִיא גוֹאֵל לִבְנֵי בְנֵיהֶם לְמַעַן שְׁמוֹ בְּאַהֲבָה"** ("and brings a redeemer to their children's children for His name's sake with love"), establishing the theological principle that redemption is motivated by God's commitment to His own name and honor. Beyond the Amidah, the phrase appears in **Selichot (penitential prayers)** and in **special liturgies for Rosh Chodesh, Festivals, Purim, and Yom Kippur**, with particular frequency in **Ashkenazi, Sefardi, and Edot HaMizrach traditions**, underscoring its centrality as a theological anchor connecting divine redemptive action to the sanctification of God's name across the entire liturgical calendar.

The phrase is recited on Weekdays, Shabbat, and Chanukah, with the full Psalm 30 (which begins with this phrase) serving as a liturgical anchor—as explained in the Eitz Chaim commentary, this psalm was chosen to precede the Pesukei D'Zimrah because it reveals David's righteousness and vindication, establishing a thematic foundation for the subsequent psalms of praise that constitute the morning's song service.

The phrase **וִיבָרֵךְ כׇּל־בָּשָׂר שֵׁם קׇדְשׁוֹ לְעוֹלָם וָעֶֽד׃** ("and let all flesh bless His holy name forever and ever") from Psalm 145:21 appears in the **Birkat Hamazon (Grace After Meals)** according to the **Edot HaMizrach** (Eastern/Sephardic) tradition. 

In the representative liturgical text, the phrase appears near the conclusion of the meal blessings, specifically within the recitation of Psalm 145 that follows the formal blessings: **"תְּהִלַּת יְהֹוָה יְדַבֶּר פִּי, וִיבָרֵךְ כָּל־בָּשָׂר שֵׁם קָדְשׁוֹ לְעוֹלָם וָעֶד"** ("The praise of the Lord shall my mouth speak, and let all flesh bless His holy name forever and ever"). This occurs after the four formal blessings of Birkat Hamazon and serves as a concluding liturgical affirmation of universal praise to God. The phrase reinforces the eschatological theme of universal acknowledgment of God's holiness that characterizes the conclusion of the Grace After Meals in this tradition.

--- LITURGICAL SUMMARY ---
Psalm 150 is recited in its entirety across eleven liturgical contexts including Ashrei, Avinu Malkenu, and Birkat HaLevana, primarily during Shacharit and Maariv services on Shabbat and weekdays across Ashkenazi, Sefardic, and Mizrachi traditions. Verses 2-4 and 6 (67% of the psalm) appear in partial form within the Amidah, Pesukei D'Zimrah, and Kiddush Levanah, extending its liturgical presence to Mincha and Musaf services as well as Yom Kippur observance. The psalm's dual usage—complete and fragmented—reflects its central role in Jewish praise liturgy, with full recitations emphasizing communal worship and partial verses integrated into core benedictions.

--- LITURGICAL SUMMARY ---
The phrase **כֹּל הַנְּשָׁמָה** (kol ha-neshamah, "every soul/all that has breath") from Psalm 150:6 appears in the concluding sections of Pesukei D'Zimrah (Verses of Song) during Shacharit services on both weekdays and Shabbat across Ashkenaz, Sefard, and Edot HaMizrach traditions. The phrase is incorporated into the Closing Verses (Ashkenazi custom) and the Shema and its Blessings sections (Sefard and Edot HaMizrach), where it functions as part of the liturgical conclusion to the morning praise service. The Talmud (Berakhot 10a) explains that these final verses from Psalms are recited to complete the Pesukei D'Zimrah, as they represent the concluding passages of the Book of Psalms, with the full verse reading: "כֹּל הַנְּשָׁמָה תְּהַלֵּל יָהּ הַלְלוּיָהּ" ("Let every soul praise the Lord, Hallelujah"), serving as a universal call to praise that transitions the worshipper from the opening hymns into the Shema recitation.

--- LITURGICAL SUMMARY ---
The phrase **"הַֽ֝לְל֗וּהוּ בְּֽצִלְצְלֵ֥י תְרוּעָֽה"** (hallelu hu b'tziltzlei t'ruah, "praise Him with loud cymbals") from Psalm 150:5 appears exclusively in the **Chapter of Song (Prek Shirah)** within Sefardic tradition. This liturgical composition, recited as a devotional text emphasizing the praises of creation, incorporates the final verses of Psalms 150 as part of its concluding section where various elements of creation voice their hymns of praise. The phrase appears three times within this single prayer context, functioning as part of the eschatological vision wherein all creation participates in divine praise, particularly in the framework of the Sefardic rite's mystical and homiletical elaboration of cosmic harmony.
