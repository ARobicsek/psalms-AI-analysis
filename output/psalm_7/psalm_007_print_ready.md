# Commentary on Psalm 7
---
## Introduction
Psalm 7 opens with two riddles and a drumbeat. “שִׁגָּיוֹן לְדָוִד… עַל־דִּבְרֵי־כּוּשׁ בֶּן־יְמִינִי” — “A shiggaion of David… concerning Cush, a Benjaminite.” “Shiggaion” appears only here and at Habakkuk 3:1 (“עַל שִׁגְיֹנוֹת”), and ancient interpreters already disagreed. Some medievals heard a musical term; others heard שְׁגָגָה, “error.” Modern dictionaries point to שָׁגָה, “to reel,” or Arabic sajʿ (rhymed prose). The safest conclusion is the most audible: a “shiggaion” signals heightened, urgent poetry—formally unsettled, emotionally unsteady. Habakkuk’s shigyonot frame a storm-theophany; here “shiggaion” announces judicial crisis.
“Cush the Benjaminite” is no less enigmatic. No such figure is otherwise known. Traditional Jewish readings identify him with Saul through wordplay: “Just as the Cushite is marked by his skin, so Saul was marked in his deeds” (Moed Katan 16b; cf. Rashi, Radak). That identification is plausible: Saul is the Benjaminite par excellence, and the superscription may be a politically prudent circumlocution. Either way, the poem is framed as a response to slander (“על־דִּבְרֵי”), not as triumphalism. Torah Temimah preserves a sharp rabbinic caution: God rebukes David for singing at Saul’s downfall; had the roles been reversed, “I might have lost many Davids for one Saul” (Moed Katan 16b). Psalm 7 is the anti-celebration: the poem of a man hounded more than vindicated.
The psalm’s architecture is legal and liturgical at once. The plea is concise: “ה׳ אֱלֹקַי בְּךָ חָסִיתִי; הוֹשִׁיעֵנִי מִכָּל־רֹדְפַי וְהַצִּילֵנִי” — “O YHWH my God, in You I have taken refuge; deliver me from all my pursuers and save me” (v. 2). The perfect “חָסִיתִי” states a status already claimed—refuge taken—on which the imperatives ride. The predator’s image follows: “פֶּן־יִטְרֹף כְּאַרְיֵה נַפְשִׁי; פֹּרֵק וְאֵין מַצִּיל” — “lest, like a lion, he tear my life; rending, and there is no deliverer” (v. 3). The shift from plural pursuers (רֹדְפַי) to a singular lion compresses many enemies into one archetypal threat. Elsewhere the wicked “wait in a covert like a lion in his lair” (Ps 10:9: “יֶאֱרֹב בַמִּסְתָּר; כְּאַרְיֵה בְסֻכּוֹ”), and in a lament of exposure: “They open their mouths at me like a tearing, roaring lion” (Ps 22:14: “פָּצ֣וּ עָלַ֣י פִּיהֶ֑ם אַ֝רְיֵ֗ה טֹרֵ֥ף וְשֹׁאֵֽג”). Psalm 7 adopts the same bestiary: when human courts fail, the wilderness rules.
What comes next is the psalm’s nerve: a triple conditional oath (vv. 4–6), the biblical equivalent of swearing on one’s life. “ה׳ אֱלֹקַי, אִם־עָשִׂיתִי זֹאת; אִם־יֶשׁ־עָוֶל בְּכַפָּי” — “O YHWH my God, if I have done this; if there is injustice in my hands” (v. 4). The demonstrative “זֹאת” is deliberately vague: whatever the accusation is, I swear against it. The third clause tightens: “אִם־גָּמַלְתִּי שׁוֹלְמִי רָע; וָאֲחַלְּצָה צֹרְרִי רֵיקָם” — “if I repaid my ally with evil; [yet] I rescued my enemy for nothing” (v. 5). The syntax staggers; the defense interrupts the oath formula as if the thought of injustice cannot be left unsaid. “שׁוֹלְמִי” is a covenantal word (“one at peace with me”); “צֹרְרִי” is the declared foe. David’s story is full of such inversions: cutting Saul’s robe, yet sparing Saul’s life (1 Sam 24); refusing to kill when urged to strike (26:8–11). The verb “חָלַץ” can mean “to deliver” (Radak, Meiri), while Rashi brilliantly hears a pun on “stripping”—David “stripped” Saul’s cloak but spared Saul’s person. The oath closes with a self-curse that reads like a verdict: “יִרְדֹף אוֹיֵב נַפְשִׁי… וְיִרְמֹס לָאָרֶץ חַיִּי; וּכְבוֹדִי לֶעָפָר יִשְׁכֵּן. סֶלָה” — “then let the enemy pursue my life… trample my life to the ground; and let my honor dwell in the dust. Selah” (v. 6). Not only bodily death but the “dwelling” of “כָּבוֹד” (reputation) in dust: social annihilation.
With “Selah” (a liturgical pause), the poem changes register. Three imperatives—“ק֘וּמָ֤ה… הִנָּשֵׂא… וְעוּרָה” (v. 7)—summon God as warrior and judge. This is the old ark-cry—“Arise, YHWH” (Num 10:35)—refitted as legal motion: “Awake for me to the judgment You commanded” (מִשְׁפָּט צִוִּיתָ). The scene goes cosmic: “וַעֲדַת לְאֻמִּים תְּסוֹבְבֶךָּ; וְעָלֶיהָ לַמָּרוֹם שׁוּבָה” — “Let the assembly of peoples surround You; over it, return to the height” (v. 8). The phrase “עֲדַת לְאֻמִּים” is rare. It can mean Israel as a congregation of tribes (Radak, citing Gen 28:3; 35:11) or the nations as an earthwide audience—perhaps even the heavenly council (cf. Ps 82:1: “אֱלֹקִים נִצָּב בַּעֲדַת אֵל; בְּקֶרֶב אֱלֹקִים יִשְׁפֹּט” — “God takes His stand in the assembly of El; in the midst of the divine beings He judges”). The ambiguity is on purpose. Personal vindication is pleaded as a test case of universal justice: “ה׳ יָדִין עַמִּים; שָׁפְטֵנִי ה׳ כְּצִדְקִי וּכְתֻמִּי עָלָי” — “YHWH judges the peoples; judge me, O YHWH, according to my righteousness and my integrity that is upon me” (v. 9). This is not a claim of sinlessness; it is a courtroom plea: judge me “in this matter.”
The pivot (vv. 10–12) is theological and anthropological. “יִגְמַר־נָא רַע רְשָׁעִים; וּתְכוֹנֵן צַדִּיק” — “Let the evil of the wicked come to an end; and establish the righteous.” Why the confidence? Because God “בֹחֵן לִבּוֹת וּכְלָיוֹת” — “probes hearts and kidneys” (v. 10). In biblical usage the “heart” is mind and will; “kidneys” are the seat of conscience and deep emotion (cf. Jer 11:20: “בֹּחֵן כְּלָיוֹת וָלֵב” — “Tester of kidneys and heart”). The next line is notorious: “אֱלֹקִים שׁוֹפֵט צַדִּיק, וְאֵל זֹעֵם בְּכָל־יוֹם” (v. 12). Read as two clauses—“God judges (for) the righteous; and a God who is angry every day”—it balances advocacy and warning. The Septuagint expands: “God is a righteous judge and strong and longsuffering,” reading patience into the daily anger. The Hebrew text’s tension is better theology: divine justice is not postponed indefinitely; moral weather patterns hold.
The final movement is as shrewd as it is visceral. If the wrongdoer “does not turn back,” weapons appear. But whose? “חַרְבּוֹ יִלְטוֹשׁ; קַשְׁתּוֹ דָּרַךְ וַיְכֹונְנֶהָ” — “He whets his sword; bends his bow and makes it ready” (v. 13). Is this God’s arsenal aimed at the wicked (Rashi), or the wicked man’s arsenal that will misfire (Ibn Ezra)? The ambiguity belongs to wisdom. Psalm 11 similarly pictures wicked archers bending bows against the upright (11:2), but in Psalm 18 God sends His own arrows: “וַיִּשְׁלַח חִצָּיו וַיְפִיצֵם” — “He sent His arrows and scattered them” (18:15). In Psalm 7, the poet collapses the two mechanisms: the world is so made that arms raised against others return to the assailant. Three images make the point: (1) ill-fated weaponry (vv. 13–14); (2) moral pregnancy whose birth is “שָׁקֶר,” a lie (v. 15; cf. Isa 59:4: “הָר֥וּ עָמָ֖ל וְיָלְד֥וּ אָוֶֽן” — “They conceive mischief and bear iniquity”); (3) the pit whose digger falls in (vv. 16–17; cf. Prov 26:27; Ps 9:16: “בְּרֶשֶׁת־זוּ טָמָנוּ נִלְכְּדָה רַגְלָם”). The law here is not statute but physics.
The vow of praise (v. 18) completes the arc: “אוֹדֶה ה׳ כְּצִדְקוֹ; וַאֲזַמְּרָה שֵׁם ה׳ עֶלְיוֹן” — “I will thank YHWH for His righteousness; I will sing to the name of YHWH Most High.” “עֶלְיוֹן” (Most High) answers “לַמָּרוֹם” (on high) from v. 8; the God summoned to take the bench is disclosed as sovereign. And “according to His righteousness” (כְּצִדְקוֹ) quietly matches the earlier plea “כְּצִדְקִי” (v. 9). The poet asked to be judged by his righteousness in this case; he ends by praising God’s righteousness in every case.
Two brief definitions for readers: by “colon” we mean a single poetic line within a parallel pair; by “inclusio” we mean a framing device where words or themes at the beginning recur at the end to enclose the whole. Psalm 7 is rich in both. It is also rich in moral weather—the sense that judgment is not only what God does but how the world works under God’s rule. The psalm is not an abstract theodicy; it is a defendant’s cry, lodged in the court of the Most High and grounded in the grammar of reality.
## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use
#### Key verses
“ק֘וּמָ֤ה ה׳ ׀ בְּאַפֶּ֗ךָ… וְע֥וּרָה אֵ֝לַ֗י מִשְׁפָּ֥ט צִוִּֽיתָ” — “Arise, O LORD, in Your anger… awake for me to the judgment You commanded” (Ps 7:7). In the Edot ha-Mizrach tradition this verse is recited before the shofar in the Rosh Hashanah Seder Tekiat Shofar. The surrounding text appeals for God’s awakened judgment as the shofar sounds: “קוּמָה ה׳ בְּאַפֶּךָ… הוֹצִיאָה מִמַּסְגֵּר נַפְשִׁי לְהוֹדוֹת אֶת־שְׁמֶךָ” (“Arise, O LORD… Bring my soul out of confinement to give thanks to Your name”). The High Holiday setting hears the verse as summons to just mercy and decisive rule.
“אֱלֹקִים שׁוֹפֵט” — “God [is] judge” (Ps 7:12). Ashkenazi communities weave this formula into devotional piyyutim before Yom Kippur night’s Maariv, often alongside justice-language: “שֶׁמֶשׁ וּמָגֵן ה׳ אֱלֹקִים, שׁוֹפֵט צֶדֶק וּמַשְׁפִּיל גְּבוֹהִים” — “Sun and shield is the LORD our God, God the Judge of righteousness who humbles the lofty.” Here Psalm 7’s judicial theology becomes the liturgical keynote of the Day of Judgment.
#### Phrases
“עֲמָלוֹ בְּרֹאשׁוֹ” — “his mischief [returns] upon his head” (Ps 7:17). In the Sefard rite this phrase is echoed in Shabbat ha-Gadol piyyutim: “לֹבֵשׁ צֶדֶק נֶאְזָר… עֲמָלוֹ בְרֹאשׁוֹ חָזָר” — “He is clothed in righteousness… his mischief returned upon his head.” The line is enlisted to celebrate the Passover reversal, where hostile designs recoil upon their makers—a liturgical appropriation of Psalm 7’s retributive law.

## Verse-by-Verse Commentary
**Verse 1**
שִׁגָּי֗וֹן לְדָוִ֫ד אֲשֶׁר־שָׁ֥ר לַֽה׳; עַל־דִּבְרֵי־כ֝וּשׁ בֶּן־יְמִינִי׃
The superscription gives us a genre marker, a singer, and a circumstance. “שִׁגָּיוֹן” is unique to Psalm 7 and Habakkuk 3:1 (“תְּפִלָּה… עַל שִׁגְיֹנוֹת”), where it frames an ecstatic theophany. The term likely signals an impassioned mode—a reeling song—rather than a specific instrument. The context here bears that out: oaths and self-curse, a courtroom cry, the “awake!” of v. 7.
“כּוּשׁ בֶּן־יְמִינִי” is the enigma. Traditional commentators identify “Cush” with Saul: Benjamin was Saul’s tribe (1 Sam 9:1–2). Moed Katan 16b reads the superscription together with 2 Sam 22:1 to caution that one must not sing at a rival’s fall; the Torah Temimah records the blunt divine retort: had Saul been David and David Saul, the loss would have been catastrophic. If the psalm belongs to David’s fugitive years, “Cush” may be diplomatic anonymization. The Midrash also plays on “Cush”: just as a Cushite is conspicuous in his skin, Saul was conspicuous in his deeds (Radak; Rashi). Either way, the superscription paints this not as general instruction but as a petition “concerning the words” (עַל־דִּבְרֵי) of a particular slanderer from Benjamin’s camp.
Liturgically the term “שִׁגָּיוֹן” also tunes our ear. Habakkuk’s shigyonot end with “לַמְנַצֵּחַ בִּנְגִינוֹתַי” (Hab 3:19), indicating a musical performance; Psalm 7 claims similar intensity if not identical performance notes. It is a rare gift to be told in advance how to hear a poem: not a cool disquisition but a plea from the edge.
**Verse 2**
ה׳ אֱ֭לֹקַי, בְּךָ חָסִיתִי; הוֹשִׁיעֵ֥נִי מִכׇּל־רֹדְפַ֗י, וְהַצִּילֵֽנִי׃
The first colon is compact theology: “ה׳ אֱלֹקַי” (YHWH my God) binds the covenant name to personal address. The perfect “חָסִיתִי” (“I have taken refuge”) announces an already claimed status; the two imperatives—“הוֹשִׁיעֵנִי… וְהַצִּילֵנִי”—lean upon it. The verbs are not redundant: “הושיע” (save) often has the ring of victory and rescue, while “הציל” (deliver, snatch away) pictures extraction from immediate danger (compare Ps 31:2–3). The plural “רֹדְפַי” (“my pursuers”) suggests more than one accuser—fitting if this is a Davidic complaint against a faction.
Cross-psalm echoes matter here. Psalm 11:1 opens similarly, “בַּה׳ חָסִיתִי” — “In YHWH I take refuge,” and then narrates counsel to flee like a bird. Psalm 7 refuses flight in favor of appeal: the remedy for false accusation is not evasion but adjudication. Note the “accentual” rhythm (the main stressed syllables that give Hebrew verse its pulse): the colon “ה׳ אֱ֭לֹקַי בְּךָ חָסִיתִי” carries three heavy beats (YHWH; my God; I-have-taken-refuge), setting an incantatory firmness before the urgent doublet “הוֹשִׁיעֵנִי… וְהַצִּילֵנִי.”
Traditional commentators (Radak, Meiri) underline the legal posture: “not in the help of man.” Refuge is a jurisdictional claim: the psalmist has moved his case to God’s court. That is the sense in which “בְּךָ חָסִיתִי” is already perfect; the hearing is in session, the bench called to sit.
**Verse 3**
פֶּן־יִטְרֹף כְּאַרְיֵה נַפְשִׁי; פֹּרֵק, וְאֵין מַצִּיל׃
The imagery compresses a crowd of pursuers into a single predator. “יִטְרֹף” (to tear, devour) is the technical verb for a beast’s kill; “פֹּרֵק” (to tear apart, dislocate) adds the brutal detail of rending. Elsewhere this bestial language maps onto political violence. Psalm 10:9 describes the wicked “כְּאַרְיֵה בְסֻכּוֹ” — “like a lion in his covert,” waiting to seize the lowly; Psalm 22:14 speaks of enemies “like a lion tearing and roaring.” The effect is to portray persecution as both human malice and inhuman appetite—law has given way to fang.
Hearing the line aloud, with the provided stress markers, heightens the menace: “פֶּן־יִט־רֹף כְּ־אַר־יֵה נַפְ־שִׁי; פֹּ־רֵק” (pen‑yit‑RŌF kə‑’ar‑YĒH naf‑SHIY; pō‑RĒQ). The stressed syllables RŌF—YĒH—SHIY—RĒQ strike like blows; the phonetic beat and the meaning coalesce.
The closing phrase, “וְאֵין מַצִּיל” (“and there is no rescuer”), clarifies the stakes. Psalm 18’s deliverance song later inverts it: “יִשְׁוַּעוּ וְאֵין מוֹשִׁיעַ” — “They cried out and there was no savior” (18:42) for the enemies; here the psalmist is the cornered one. The rhetorical move is straightforward: where human rescue is exhausted, appeal to the divine bench is not pious flourish but necessity.
**Verse 4**
ה׳ אֱלֹקַי, אִם־עָשִׂיתִי זֹאת; אִם־יֶשׁ־עָוֶל בְּכַפָּֽי׃
We now reach the oath proper. Ancient Near Eastern treaties often required a vassal to swear conditional self-curses—if I violate the covenant, may X befall me. Here the psalmist swears the negative: “If I have done this; if there is injustice in my hands.” The demonstrative “זֹאת” is deliberately undefined; it encompasses the accusation without repeating it, a way of refusing slander any further purchase. The idiom “בְּכַפָּי” (literally “in my palms”) renders guilt tactile—what my hands did or did not do.
Traditional readings already connect this with David’s restraint toward Saul. Radak glosses: “If I have done what he does to me,” i.e., if I repaid evil. The oath’s seriousness is not merely rhetorical. Numbers 5’s ordeal for a suspected adulteress—a different case, to be sure—turns on an oath with self-imprecation (“אָמֵן אָמֵן”). The psychological point is similar: the oath both dares God to test and invites God to vindicate. That is the legal and spiritual courage of this psalm.
**Verse 5**
אִם־גָּמַלְתִּי שׇׁלְמִי רָע; וָאֲחַלְּצָה צֹרְרִי רֵיקָם׃
This colon pair contains an ethical reversal. “שׇׁלְמִי” (my ally, one at peace with me) evokes covenantal loyalty (from שָׁלֵם, wholeness/peace). To “repay” (גמל) such a one “evil” would be the betrayal alleged. But the psalmist interjects the counter-fact: “וָאֲחַלְּצָה צֹרְרִי רֵיקָם” — “I rescued my enemy for nothing.” The verb “חָלַץ” in biblical Hebrew often means “to deliver” (cf. Ps 50:15, 81:8), though Rashi playing on its Aramaic range also hears “stripping”—David cutting Saul’s cloak—only to demonstrate mercy. Either way, the syntax enacts moral protest: the oath’s third “if” clause is interrupted by the memory of clemency.
The historical substrate is transparent. Twice David spared Saul when he could have killed him. In 1 Samuel 24:5–8 he severed the robe’s corner but refused to shed blood; in 26:8–11 he forbade Abishai to strike the sleeping Saul: “Do not destroy him!” The adverb “רֵיקָם” (“for nothing,” “without compensation”) sharpens the point—mercy given without reward met slander in return. That reversal is what provokes the psalm’s oath: this is not a generalized claim to righteousness, but innocence in a particular dossier.
Theologically, the line also models how biblical complaint works: protest erupts in the very grammar of prayer. The oath of innocence is not cool; it is indignant, and morally specific.
**Verse 6**
יִרְדֹף־אוֹיֵב נַפְשִׁי, וְיַשֵּׂג; וְיִרְמֹס לָאָרֶץ חַיָּי; וּכְבוֹדִי לֶעָפָר יִשְׁכֵּן. סֶלָה׃
The apodosis arrives: “Then let the enemy pursue my life… overtake… trample my life to the ground; and let my honor dwell in the dust.” This is the self-curse the oath invokes if the defendant is guilty. The verbs outline a grim sequence—pursuit, capture, trampling—culminating not only in physical ruin (“חַיָּי”) but in reputational burial (“כְּבוֹדִי… לֶעָפָר יִשְׁכֵּן”). Job uses “כָּבוֹד” similarly for personal standing (Job 29:20). The chilling “יִשְׁכֵּן” (“shall dwell”) implies permanence: let my honor make its home in dust.
The “סֶלָה” marks a hinge. Liturgically it is a pause; structurally it completes the oath and opens the summons. The rhetorical effect is to mimic legal procedure: the defendant has sworn; the court is now asked to convene. It is worth noting the body/earth imagery here anticipates Psalm 44:25–26: “כִּ֤י שָׁ֣חָה לֶעָפָ֣ר נַפְשֵׁ֑נוּ; דָּבְקָה לָאָרֶץ בִּטְנֵֽנוּ” — “For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our belly clings to the earth.” The difference is that Psalm 7 volunteers the dust if guilty; Psalm 44 laments the dust despite innocence. The psalms know both horizons.
**Verse 7**
ק֘וּמָ֤ה ה׳ בְּאַפֶּ֗ךָ; הִנָּשֵׂא בְּעַבְר֣וֹת צוֹרְרָ֑י; וְע֥וּרָה אֵלַ֗י, מִשְׁפָּט צִוִּֽיתָ׃
Three imperatives—“Arise… be lifted up… awake”—compose a theophanic summons, but not for conquest alone: “Awake for me to the judgment You commanded.” “אַף” and “עֶבְרָה” (anger/fury) name the opponents’ rage and God’s answer; the Niphal “הִנָּשֵׂא” (be exalted) pictures God’s taking the bench. Ancient liturgy echoes: “קוּמָה ה׳, וְיָפֻצוּ אֹיְבֶיךָ” (Num 10:35). The psalm redeploys the battle-cry as a legal motion. “משפט צוית”—“the judgment You commanded”—can mean the decreed order of justice anchored in Torah (Deut 16:20), or, as Malbim suggests, the specific judgment of kingship announced to David (1 Sam 16). Either way, the psalmist does not invent a plea; he appeals to a known rule.
The line shows how biblical petition holds God to God’s own word, not to human deserves. That is not presumption; it is the essence of covenant speech. It also explains the boldness of what follows: if the case is heard, it must be heard publicly.
**Verse 8**
וַעֲדַת לְאֻמִּים תְּסוֹבְבֶךָּ; וְעָלֶיהָ לַמָּרוֹם שׁוּבָה׃
“Let the assembly of peoples surround You; over it return on high.” The Hebrew is deliberately duplex. “עֵדָה” often means Israel’s congregation, but “לְאֻמִּים” (peoples) typically means nations. The line can thus imagine Israel’s tribes gathered before God the judge (Radak), or the nations assembling, or a heavenly council scene akin to Psalm 82. Psalm 9 shares the idiom: “וְהוּא יִשְׁפֹּט־תֵּבֵל בְּצֶדֶק; יָדִין לְאֻמִּים בְּמֵישָׁרִים” — “He judges the world in righteousness; He will judge the peoples with equity” (9:9). Psalm 7 aligns personal vindication with that global justice.
“שׁוּבָה” (return) can mean: take Your seat again above them; or withdraw Your presence from them for their oppressions (as some read). The parallel with v. 18’s “ה׳ עֶלְיוֹן” (Most High) suggests enthronement: “over it return on high.” The framing (“on high” / “Most High”) functions as inclusio: God who “returns” to the height in court is praised as “Most High” when the case is done.
**Verse 9**
ה׳ יָדִין עַמִּים; שְׁפָטֵנִי ה׳ כְּצִדְקִי, וּכְתֻמִּי עָלָי׃
The argument now turns tightly: because “YHWH judges the peoples,” “judge me.” Two different judicial verbs are used. “דִּין” carries the sense of adjudicate or render a verdict; “שָׁפַט” includes govern/judge. The plea “כְּצִדְקִי” (according to my righteousness) and “וּכְתֻמִּי” (and my integrity) is situational, not absolute; Job makes the same claim within a case (Job 27:6). The phrase “עָלָי” (“that is upon me”) suggests integrity as a quality with which one is invested; God is asked to see that reality.
The rhetorical move is crucial. The psalmist is not asking for a special dispensation; he is asking that the universal justice proclaimed (“יָדִין עַמִּים”) be applied in this specific dossier. In other words, the personal and the cosmic are one case.
**Verse 10**
יִגְמַר־נָא רַע רְשָׁעִים; וּתְכוֹנֵן צַדִּיק; וּבֹחֵן לִבּוֹת וּכְלָיוֹת — אֱלֹקִים צַדִּיק׃
The jussive “יִגְמַר” (“let it be finished”) can be read transitively (“let the evil bring the wicked to an end,” Rashi) or intransitively (“let the evil of the wicked come to an end”). Either way, the positive complement is not mere acquittal but stability: “וּתְכוֹנֵן צַדִּיק” — “establish the righteous.” Justice is restorative order, not just retribution.
The ground for such a petition is God’s omniscience: “בֹחֵן לִבּוֹת וּכְלָיוֹת” (“tester of hearts and kidneys”). Jeremiah 11:20 and 17:10 use precisely this pair. In biblical anthropology, the “heart” is mind, intent, and volition; the “kidneys” are the seat of counsel and conscience. The concluding apposition “אֱלֹקִים צַדִּיק” can be read as a predicate (“God is righteous”) or as a vocative (“O righteous God”). The theological logic is: because You see fully, You may judge fully; because You are righteous, You will.
**Verse 11**
מָגִנִּי עַל־אֱלֹקִים; מוֹשִׁיעַ יִשְׁרֵי־לֵב׃
Literally, “My shield is upon God” — a striking prepositional choice. We would expect “God is my shield,” and elsewhere we get exactly that (Ps 18:31: “מָגֵן הוּא לְכׇל הַחֹסִים בּוֹ” — “He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him”). Here the “עַל” (“upon”) likely means “rests upon”: my protection depends upon God; my shield is laid upon Him. That reading is confirmed by the parallel: “He saves the upright of heart.” The syntactic surprise performs the spiritual truth—faith shifts the weight onto God.
The phrase “יִשְׁרֵי־לֵב” recalls Psalm 11:2, where the wicked “shoot in the dark at the upright heart” (“לְיִשְׁרֵי־לֵב”). Psalm 7 replies: God saves the “upright of heart.” The contest is not merely tactical (arrows vs. shields); it is moral posture: whose heart is straight, whose intent is crooked. The “shield” commendation thus follows seamlessly upon “tester of hearts and kidneys.”
**Verse 12**
אֱלֹקִים שׁוֹפֵט צַדִּיק; וְאֵל זֹעֵם בְּכָל־יוֹם׃
Two statements stand in tension, as they should. God judges (for) the righteous; and “a God is angry every day.” The Septuagint expands: “God is a righteous judge and strong and longsuffering,” adding “longsuffering” (μακρόθυμος) to soften the “every day.” The Hebrew retains the sharp edge. Daily anger does not mean daily smiting; it means that moral reality is not dormant—God’s disposition toward injustice is not episodic. The line pushes against a perennial complaint that judgment is delayed or absent. Another psalm will acknowledge the delay (“How long?”), but Psalm 7 tightens the screw: Divine anger is not a mood swing; it is a constant.
This makes sense only next to what follows, where the self-undoing of evil is described. God’s anger is not always intervention from without; it often works through what evil does to itself.
**Verse 13**
אִם־לֹא יָשׁוּב — חַרְבּוֹ יִלְטוֹשׁ; קַשְׁתּוֹ דָרַךְ, וַיְכֹונְנֶהָ׃
“If he does not turn back,” the weapons gleam. But the subject remains teasingly open. Is this God (“He whets His sword”) or the wicked man (“he whets his own sword”)? Rashi opts for God; Ibn Ezra, for the wicked. Psalmic diction allows either. Psalm 11:2 pictures the wicked bending the bow; Psalm 18:15 pictures God sending arrows. The wisdom point is that moral order is such that the man who arms himself for harm is already in danger, regardless of whether divine arrows fly. “וַיְכֹונְנֶהָ” (“he makes it ready”) underscores deliberation; none of this is accidental.
The choice left to the wicked—“if he does not turn back”—keeps penitence in play. Even in a psalm about vindication, the possibility of reversal is mentioned first.
**Verse 14**
וְלוֹ הֵכִין כְּלֵי־מָוֶת; חִצָּיו לְדֹלְקִים, יִפְעָל׃
“For himself he prepares instruments of death; his arrows he makes for pursuers.” The received text can be read reflexively (“for himself”—thus the boomerang) or causally (“on his account”). Either way, the “לְדֹלְקִים” (“for pursuers”) harks back to v. 2’s “רֹדְפַי.” The man who hunts others becomes prey; his own arrows are, as it were, marked for those like him. Psalm 9 presents the same geometry: “בְּרֶשֶׁת־זוּ טָמָנוּ נִלְכְּדָה רַגְלָם” — “in the net that they hid, their foot is caught” (9:16).
The interplay of divine agency and moral recoil is intentional. The psalm does not deny God’s direct action; it names a structure by which God’s justice is often enacted: the devices of violence are inherently unstable. This is both warning and consolation.
**Verse 15**
הִנֵּה יְחַבֶּל־אָוֶן; וְהָרָה עָמָל, וְיָלַד שָׁקֶר׃
A second image: gestation. “He travails with iniquity; he conceives mischief; and he gives birth to falsehood.” Isaiah uses almost the same line of indictment: “הָר֥וּ עָמָ֖ל וְיָלְד֥וּ אָוֶֽן” — “They conceive mischief and bear iniquity” (Isa 59:4). The order in Psalm 7 (travail—conception—birth) may feel inverted to us; but the point is emphatic inevitability—once the process begins, the outcome is determined. The creature imagined is “שֶׁקֶר,” a lie. Moral pregnancy yields fraudulent “offspring,” a tidy way to say that evil schemes cannot produce what their makers promise.
As in v. 13, “turn back” is the obvious alternative; otherwise the process runs to term. The image is tender and brutal at once—a telling fit for the poem’s tone.
**Verse 16**
בּוֹר כָּרָה, וַיַּחְפְּרֵהוּ; וַיִּפֹּל בְּשַׁחַת יִפְעָל׃
Image three: the pit. Two verbs—“כָּרָה” (to dig) and “חָפַר” (to excavate)—emphasize industry. The result is that “he falls into the ditch he makes.” This proverb recurs often: “כֹּרֶה שַׁחַת בָּהּ יִפֹּל” — “He who digs a pit will fall into it” (Prov 26:27); “טָבְעוּ גּוֹיִם בְּשַׁחַת עָשׂוּ” — “The nations have sunk into the pit that they made” (Ps 9:16). Esther gives the story-form: Haman is hanged on his own gallows (Est 7:10). The accumulation of verbs in Psalm 7 underscores agency; this is not accidental calamity but a predictable consequence.
Read with vv. 13–14, the three images are not merely parallel but mutually interpretive: weapon, womb, and worksite, each producing not the intended outcome but its opposite.
**Verse 17**
יָשׁוּב עֲמָלוֹ בְּרֹאשׁוֹ; וְעַל קׇדְקֳדוֹ, חֲמָסוֹ יֵרֵד׃
The conclusion of the “boomerang” theme turns anatomical. “His mischief returns upon his head; upon his skull his violence descends.” The doublet “רֹאשׁ” / “קׇדְקׇד” suggests both metaphorical and literal head: thought and action, plan and blow. Malbim notes the symmetry with v. 15’s “conception” (in the head) and v. 16’s “pit” (in the hands). The “descent” of violence onto the “skull” is almost forensic in its precision.
Psalm 7 ends the justice section where its oath began—on the head. In v. 6 the psalmist’s “כְבוֹדִי” (honor) threatened to “dwell” in dust; in v. 17 the enemy’s violence dwells (so to speak) on his own skull. The reversal is complete.
**Verse 18**
אוֹדֶה ה׳ כְּצִדְקוֹ; וַאֲזַמְּרָה שֵׁם ה׳ עֶלְיוֹן׃
The vow of praise is the proper conclusion to a heard case. The adverbial “כְּצִדְקוֹ” (“according to His righteousness”) balances “כְּצִדְקִי” (v. 9): the measure of personal vindication is ultimately God’s justice, not self’s. The title “עֶלְיוֹן” (Most High) closes the inclusio begun in v. 8 (“לַמָּרוֹם”), and also echoes Psalm 9:3: “אֲזַמְּרָה שִׁמְךָ עֶלְיוֹן” — “I will sing praise to Your Name, O Most High.” It is an elegant fit: the psalm has moved from shiggaion—reeling song—to zemer—ordered doxology.
Theologically, the verse seals the psalm’s core claim. Justice is not merely the punitive force of divine intervention; it is the choreography of a world governed by a righteous God. To recognize that is to praise—not only for a single acquittal, but for the kind of cosmos one lives in.

Definitions (for readers): “Colon” = one poetic line within a parallel pair; “Inclusio” = framing device by repetition at beginning and end; “Jussive” = a Hebrew verb form expressing a wish or request, often translated “let [it]…”.
This commentary has aimed to show the psalm’s argument by letting the Hebrew speak—through the oath’s legal form, the summons’s liturgical cadence, and the wisdom images’ inevitabilities. Above all, Psalm 7 teaches how to pray when one’s life and name are at stake: swear if you must, summon the Judge, and then let the world’s moral gravity do some of the work.
