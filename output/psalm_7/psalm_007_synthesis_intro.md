# Introduction Essay: Psalm 7

The opening line of Psalm 7 confronts us with a puzzle: "שִׁגָּי֗וֹן לְדָ֫וִ֥ד אֲשֶׁר־שָׁ֥ר לַֽיהֹוָ֑ה עַל־דִּבְרֵי־כ֝֗וּשׁ בֶּן־יְמִינִֽי" ("A *shiggaion* of David, which he sang to the LORD concerning Cush, a Benjaminite"). What is a *shiggaion*? Who is Cush? The word *shiggaion* appears elsewhere only in Habakkuk 3:1, where it introduces that prophet's ecstatic theophanic vision. The Aramaic Targum translates it as a prayer sung "with a musical instrument," while Rashi and medieval commentators connect it to שְׁגָגָה (error), suggesting David composed this psalm about his "error" in prematurely celebrating Saul's downfall. But the Klein Dictionary points us in a different direction: Arabic cognates like *sajʿ* (rhymed prose) suggest an emotionally intense, perhaps formally irregular composition. The BDB lexicon proposes it derives from שָׁגָה (to reel, stagger), indicating "wild, passionate song, with rapid changes of rhythm." This single enigmatic term thus signals that what follows will be urgent, unsteady—poetry written from the edge.

As for "Cush the Benjaminite," he appears nowhere else in Scripture. The Midrash (Moed Katan 16b) identifies him with Saul himself, noting wordplay: "Just as the Cushite (Ethiopian) is distinctive in his skin, so Saul was distinctive in his deeds." This is not mere allegory. Benjamin was Saul's tribe, and if Psalm 7 originates in the bitter years when David fled from Saul's court, then diplomatic circumlocution—calling the king "Cush" rather than naming him—becomes strategic necessity. What we have, then, is a juridical prayer composed under political duress, a legal brief presented to the cosmic court when earthly courts have failed.

The psalm's architecture reveals its forensic logic. After the desperate opening petition—"יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱ֭לֹהַי בְּךָ֣ חָסִ֑יתִי הוֹשִׁיעֵ֥נִי מִכׇּל־רֹ֝דְפַ֗י וְהַצִּילֵֽנִי" ("O LORD my God, in You I seek refuge; deliver me from all my pursuers and save me," v. 2)—comes the poem's dramatic center: a triple oath of innocence. The threefold *im* (אִם, "if") structure in verses 4-5 mirrors Ancient Near Eastern covenant curses. The psalmist swears: "אִם־עָשִׂ֣יתִי זֹ֑את אִֽם־יֶשׁ־עָ֥וֶל בְּכַפָּֽי" ("if I have done this, if there is wrongdoing in my hands," v. 4). But the third *im* clause disrupts the expected pattern with a parenthetical defense: "אִם־גָּ֭מַלְתִּי שֽׁוֹלְמִ֥י רָ֑ע וָאֲחַלְּצָ֖ה צֽוֹרְרִ֥י רֵיקָֽם" ("if I repaid my ally with evil—I who rescued my enemy without cause!" v. 5). The syntax stumbles here—the protest interrupts the oath formula—as if the psalmist cannot contain his indignation long enough to finish the legal boilerplate. Radak notes this is not "just any enemy" but specifically Saul, the king David had twice spared (1 Samuel 24, 26). The disrupted grammar performs the disrupted justice: the accused interrupts his own oath to cry foul.

If the oath of innocence were refused, the psalmist invokes upon himself the covenant curse: "יִ֥רַדֹּֽף־אוֹיֵ֨ב ׀ נַפְשִׁ֡י וְיַשֵּׂ֗ג וְיִרְמֹ֣ס לָאָ֣רֶץ חַיָּ֑י וּכְבוֹדִ֓י ׀ לֶעָפָ֖ר יַשְׁכֵּ֣ן סֶֽלָה" ("Let the enemy pursue and overtake me, trample my life to the ground, and make my honor dwell in the dust. *Selah*," v. 6). The progression from "life" (חַיַּי) to "honor" (כְּבוֹדִ֓י) to "dust" (עָפָ֖ר) traces the trajectory of total social death—not just physical destruction but the obliteration of reputation. The rare term *kabod* here does not mean God's glory but human honor, one's standing in the community. The single *Selah* that follows marks this as the psalm's legal hinge: the oath is complete; now the cosmic trial begins.

The shift at verse 7 is breathtaking in its audacity: "ק֘וּמָ֤ה יְהֹוָ֨ה ׀ בְּאַפֶּ֗ךָ הִ֭נָּשֵׂא בְּעַבְר֣וֹת צוֹרְרָ֑י וְע֥וּרָה אֵ֝לַ֗י מִשְׁפָּ֥ט צִוִּֽיתָ" ("Arise, O LORD, in Your anger; lift Yourself up against the fury of my foes; awaken for me—You have ordained judgment," v. 7). Three imperatives hammer at heaven—*kumah* (arise), *hinnase* (lift up), *urah* (awaken)—as if God were asleep or inattentive. This is the language of theophanic summons found in the older victory hymns (Psalm 68:2, Numbers 10:35), but here it is weaponized as legal procedure. The phrase "מִשְׁפָּ֥ט צִוִּֽיתָ" ("judgment You have ordained") is crucial: the psalmist does not ask God to *invent* justice but to *execute* the judgment already decreed in Torah. Malbim notes that the psalmist portrays his persecutor as the very "rod of God's anger" against him, then pleads for God to examine whether this punishment is justified by examining the accuser's own deeds.

Then comes verse 8, where personal vindication explodes into cosmic drama: "וַעֲדַ֣ת לְ֭אֻמִּים תְּסֽוֹבְבֶ֑ךָּ וְ֝עָלֶ֗יהָ לַמָּר֥וֹם שֽׁוּבָה" ("Let the assembly of peoples surround You, and over it return on high," v. 8). Who is this "assembly of peoples" (*adat leummim*)? Radak insists they are the twelve tribes of Israel, citing Isaac's blessing of Jacob: "וְהָיִ֖יתָ לִקְהַ֥ל עַמִּֽים" ("you shall become an assembly of peoples," Genesis 28:3). But the phrase's echo of divine council imagery (Psalm 82:1, "בַּעֲדַת־אֵל," "in the assembly of El") suggests something grander: God enthroned above all nations—or all divine beings—as universal judge. The ambiguity is strategic. The psalm's rhetoric demands that David's personal case be heard before the widest possible tribunal, yet without abandoning the covenant framework where Israel remains God's particular concern.

The twin assertions of verses 9-10 clarify the terms: "יְהֹוָה֮ יָדִ֢ין עַ֫מִּ֥ים שׇׁפְטֵ֥נִי יְהֹוָ֑ה כְּצִדְקִ֖י וּכְתֻמִּ֣י עָלָֽי" ("The LORD judges the peoples; judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness and my integrity," v. 9). The double use of forensic terminology—*yadin* (judges, from דִּין) and *shofeteni* (judge me, from שָׁפַט)—anchors the cosmic scene in actual legal procedure. Then the petition: "יִגְמׇר־נָ֬א רַ֨ע ׀ רְשָׁעִים֮ וּתְכוֹנֵ֢ן צַ֫דִּ֥יק וּבֹחֵ֣ן לִ֭בּוֹת וּכְלָי֗וֹת אֱלֹהִ֥ים צַדִּֽיק" ("Let the evil of the wicked come to an end, but establish the righteous; You who probe hearts and kidneys, O righteous God," v. 10). The body-part pairing *libot u-kelayot* (hearts and kidneys) is standard biblical anthropology for totality of inner life—what we might call mind and emotions, or conscious and unconscious moral will. This divine omniscience becomes the foundation for the psalmist's confidence: "מָגִנִּ֥י עַל־אֱלֹהִ֑ים מ֝וֹשִׁ֗יעַ יִשְׁרֵי־לֵֽב" ("My shield is with God, who saves the upright of heart," v. 11).

But the psalm's theological innovation lies in verses 13-17, where the machinery of retribution is described with almost scientific precision. If the enemy "does not turn back" (אִם־לֹ֣א יָ֭שׁוּב, v. 13), three parallel mechanisms ensure his destruction. First, weaponry: "חַרְבּ֣וֹ יִלְט֑וֹשׁ קַשְׁתּ֥וֹ דָ֝רַ֗ךְ וַֽיְכוֹנְנֶֽהָ. וְ֭לוֹ הֵכִ֣ין כְּלֵי־מָ֑וֶת חִ֝צָּ֗יו לְֽדֹלְקִ֥ים יִפְעָֽל" ("He whets his sword, bends his bow and makes it ready; he prepares deadly weapons, he makes his arrows into firebrands," vv. 13-14). The subject here is brilliantly ambiguous—is this God preparing weapons against the wicked, or the wicked preparing weapons that will boomerang? Medieval commentators divided: Rashi says God; Ibn Ezra says the wicked man. The ambiguity itself makes the theological point: divine judgment works *through* the structures of moral causation.

The second mechanism is biological: "הִנֵּ֥ה יְחַבֶּל־אָ֑וֶן וְהָרָ֥ה עָ֝מָ֗ל וְיָ֣לַד שָֽׁקֶר" ("Behold, he travails with evil, conceives mischief, and gives birth to fraud," v. 15). The pregnancy metaphor presents moral causation as a natural process. But notice the verb sequence: *yechabel* (travails), *harah* (conceived), *yalad* (gave birth). The chronology is reversed—labor pains before conception. This is not biological realism but rhetorical urgency: the outcome (fraud) is inevitable from the first motion toward evil. The wicked man is caught in a process he cannot stop, birthing his own destruction.

The third mechanism is spatial: "בּ֣וֹר כָּ֭רָה וַֽיַּחְפְּרֵ֑הוּ וַ֝יִּפֹּ֗ל בְּשַׁ֣חַת יִפְעָֽל" ("He dug a pit and excavated it, but he fell into the trap he made," v. 16). Two verbs for digging (*karah* and *chafar*) emphasize the labor invested, making the reversal more complete. The motif of the pit-digger caught in his own trap appears across wisdom literature (Proverbs 26:27, Ecclesiastes 10:8) and resurfaces in the Esther story (7:10), where Haman is hanged on his own gallows. Psalm 7 presents this not as poetic justice but as mechanical law: "יָשׁ֣וּב עֲמָל֣וֹ בְרֹאשׁ֑וֹ וְעַ֥ל קׇ֝דְקֳד֗וֹ חֲמָס֥וֹ יֵרֵֽד" ("His mischief returns upon his head, and his violence descends upon his skull," v. 17). The anatomical specificity—*rosh* (head) and *qodqod* (skull)—makes the violence almost forensic in its precision.

The psalm concludes not with triumphalism but with measured gratitude: "אוֹדֶ֣ה יְהֹוָ֣ה כְּצִדְק֑וֹ וַ֝אֲזַמְּרָ֗ה שֵֽׁם־יְהֹוָ֥ה עֶלְיֽוֹן" ("I will praise the LORD according to His righteousness, and sing to the name of the LORD Most High," v. 18). The epithet *Elyon* (Most High) echoes *lamarom* (on high) from verse 8, creating an inclusio: the God summoned to rise and judge has now been revealed as sovereign. The phrase "according to His righteousness" (*ke-tzidko*) suggests proportionality—the praise matches the justice received, as in a legal settlement where damages are calculated. The psalm that began in the genre of *shiggaion*—that wild, passionate song—ends in disciplined worship. The transformation of desperate petition into confident praise traces the arc of answered prayer, but also the deeper transformation of the psalmist's understanding: justice is not arbitrary divine intervention but the grammar of reality itself, written into the moral structure of the cosmos. In that recognition lies the psalm's enduring claim to canonical authority.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

Psalm 7 as a complete composition does not feature prominently in the fixed daily or Shabbat liturgy across major Jewish traditions. However, specific phrases from this psalm have been incorporated into liturgical contexts where their juridical and penitential themes resonate with the theological emphases of particular occasions.

The phrase "קוּמָה ה' בְּאַפֶּךָ הִנָּשֵׂא בְּעַבְרוֹת צוֹרְרָי וְעוּרָה אֵלַי מִשְׁפָּט צִוִּיתָ" ("
