# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 7

The draft already grasps the poem’s backbone: Psalm 7 is a forensic lament that moves from a petition (vv. 2–3) to an oath of innocence (vv. 4–6), to a theophanic summons (vv. 7–10), and then to a meditation on moral causality (vv. 13–17), concluding with praise (v. 18). The writer rightly stresses the triple “if” oath, the juridical texture, the hinge at Selah (v. 6), and the deliberate ambiguity of who readies the weapons (vv. 13–14). There is also strong sensitivity to older Israelite battle cries (Num 10:35; Ps 68:2), to the divine council horizon (v. 8), and to retributive “boomerang” imagery.

The weaknesses are chiefly in execution. The draft often gestures toward parallels, liturgical usage, and philology without quoting Hebrew or letting readers see the texts. The figurative language database is referenced but seldom demonstrated with Hebrew citations. LXX differences (notably in v. 12) are noted but not unpacked. The rare syntax “מָגִנִּי עַל־אֱלֹהִים” (v. 11) gets only a glancing comment; so does the remarkable inversion of gestation order in v. 15, though Isaiah 59:4 (“הָר֥וּ עָמָ֖ל וְיָלְד֥וּ אָוֶֽן”) is the obvious parallel to quote. The “assembly of peoples” (v. 8) deserves fuller comparison with Psalm 9 and Psalm 82, with Hebrew examples. Technical terms (inclusio, colon, etc.) are used without quick definitions. And the liturgical section is incomplete; it should quote the actual prayers.

Revisions needed: (1) Quote Hebrew and English for biblical parallels and liturgical texts; (2) define technical terms briefly as they appear; (3) engage the LXX where illuminating; (4) clarify contested readings (vv. 13–14; v. 5 “וָאֲחַלְּצָה”); (5) use sound where it helps (selectively, with the provided phonetic stress); (6) bring in missed but available parallels (Isa 59:4; Ps 9; Ps 82; Prov 26:27). The verse-by-verse should begin with the Hebrew verse (punctuated to show cola), then proceed to analysis, integrating traditional commentators and the Torah Temimah’s Saul/David material. The reader should be shown the text—Hebrew and English—at each crucial point.
