      "What is the relationship between active divine judgment (vv. 7-12) and inherent retributive justice (vv. 13-17)? Does God act directly or through moral order?",
      "How does the 'God pronounces doom each day' (v. 12) relate to the delay of judgment theme elsewhere in Psalms? Is this about patience or ongoing active judgment?",
      "What is the significance of 'probes mind and conscience/heart and kidneys' (v. 10) in biblical anthropology? How does this relate to divine omniscience and moral assessment?",
      "How does the final epithet 'LORD Most High' (יְהֹוָה עֶלְיוֹן, v. 18) function, especially given the earlier 'on high' (לַמָּרוֹם, v. 8)? Is there intentional echo/inclusio?",

      "What is the etymology and meaning of 'shiggaion' (שִׁגָּיוֹן) in v1, and why does it appear only here and Habakkuk 3? Does it indicate emotional intensity, musical form, or literary genre?",
      "Who is 'Cush the Benjaminite' (v1), and what are the political implications of a Benjaminite accuser in a Davidic psalm, given Benjamin was Saul's tribe?",
      "Why does the psalmist shift from plural 'pursuers' (רֹדְפַי) in v2 to singular 'lion' metaphor in v3? Does this suggest multiple human enemies coalesce into one archetypal threat?",
      "What specific accusation is addressed in vv4-5? What does the phrase 'dealt evil to my ally' (גָּמַלְתִּי שֽׁוֹלְמִי רָע) mean, and how does the parenthetical 'I who rescued my foe without reward' function rhetorically?",
      "Is the preposition 'עַל' in v11 ('my shield is upon God') unusual? Why not 'from God' or 'with God'—what theological or linguistic point does 'upon' make?",
      "Who is the subject of vv13-14—is God preparing weapons against the wicked, or is the wicked preparing weapons that will backfire? How does this ambiguity function rhetorically and theologically?",
      "Why is the pregnancy/birth metaphor in v15 in reverse chronological order (travail mentioned before conception)? Does this serve a rhetorical or poetic function?",
      "How do the three self-destruction metaphors (weapons vv13-14, pregnancy v15, pit-digging vv16-17) relate to each other—are they parallel examples, escalating certainty, or different aspects of retributive justice?",
      "What is the relationship between active divine judgment described in vv7-12 and inherent self-destructive justice in vv13-17? Does God judge actively or through moral order, or both?",
      "How does 'God pronounces doom each day' (v12) relate to the problem of delayed judgment elsewhere in Psalms? Is this about patience, ongoing threat, or continuous active judgment?",
      "What is the significance of the body part pair 'hearts and kidneys' (לִבּוֹת וּכְלָיוֹת) in v10 for biblical anthropology and divine omniscience?",
      "Does the final epithet 'YHWH Most High' (יְהֹוָה עֶלְיֽוֹן) in v18 intentionally echo 'on high' (לַמָּרוֹם) from v8, creating an inclusio that connects personal vindication to cosmic sovereignty?",
      "Why does the LXX add 'longsuffering' (μακρόθυμος) in v12, not present in the Hebrew? Is this theological interpretation addressing the tension of daily judgment with apparent delay?",
      "What does 'assembly of peoples' (עֲדַת לְאֻמִּים) in v8 represent—earthly nations gathered for judgment or heavenly divine council? How does this relate to divine council imagery in Psalm 82 or Ugaritic texts?",
      "How does the specific emphasis on praising God's 'righteousness' (צֶדֶק) in v18 connect to the forensic/juridical frame of the entire psalm? Is this a thematic inclusio with the righteousness claims in vv9-10?"
