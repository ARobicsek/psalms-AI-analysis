Psalm 7 opens with two riddles and a drumbeat. “שִׁגָּיוֹן לְדָוִד… עַל־דִּבְרֵי־כּוּשׁ בֶּן־יְמִינִי” — “A shiggaion of David… concerning Cush, a Benjaminite.” “Shiggaion” appears only here and at Habakkuk 3:1 (“עַל שִׁגְיֹנוֹת”), and ancient interpreters already disagreed. Some medievals heard a musical term; others heard שְׁגָגָה, “error.” Modern dictionaries point to שָׁגָה, “to reel,” or Arabic sajʿ (rhymed prose). The safest conclusion is the most audible: a “shiggaion” signals heightened, urgent poetry—formally unsettled, emotionally unsteady. Habakkuk’s shigyonot frame a storm-theophany; here “shiggaion” announces judicial crisis.

“Cush the Benjaminite” is no less enigmatic. No such figure is otherwise known. Traditional Jewish readings identify him with Saul through wordplay: “Just as the Cushite is marked by his skin, so Saul was marked in his deeds” (Moed Katan 16b; cf. Rashi, Radak). That identification is plausible: Saul is the Benjaminite par excellence, and the superscription may be a politically prudent circumlocution. Either way, the poem is framed as a response to slander (“על־דִּבְרֵי”), not as triumphalism. Torah Temimah preserves a sharp rabbinic caution: God rebukes David for singing at Saul’s downfall; had the roles been reversed, “I might have lost many Davids for one Saul” (Moed Katan 16b). Psalm 7 is the anti-celebration: the poem of a man hounded more than vindicated.

The psalm’s architecture is legal and liturgical at once. The plea is concise: “יְהוָה אֱלֹהַי בְּךָ חָסִיתִי; הוֹשִׁיעֵנִי מִכָּל־רֹדְפַי וְהַצִּילֵנִי” — “O YHWH my God, in You I have taken refuge; deliver me from all my pursuers and save me” (v. 2). The perfect “חָסִיתִי” states a status already claimed—refuge taken—on which the imperatives ride. The predator’s image follows: “פֶּן־יִטְרֹף כְּאַרְיֵה נַפְשִׁי; פֹּרֵק וְאֵין מַצִּיל” — “lest, like a lion, he tear my life; rending, and there is no deliverer” (v. 3). The shift from plural pursuers (רֹדְפַי) to a singular lion compresses many enemies into one archetypal threat. Elsewhere the wicked “wait in a covert like a lion in his lair” (Ps 10:9: “יֶאֱרֹב בַמִּסְתָּר; כְּאַרְיֵה בְסֻכּוֹ”), and in a lament of exposure: “They open their mouths at me like a tearing, roaring lion” (Ps 22:14: “פָּצ֣וּ עָלַ֣י פִּיהֶ֑ם אַ֝רְיֵ֗ה טֹרֵ֥ף וְשֹׁאֵֽג”). Psalm 7 adopts the same bestiary: when human courts fail, the wilderness rules.

What comes next is the psalm’s nerve: a triple conditional oath (vv. 4–6), the biblical equivalent of swearing on one’s life. “יְהוָה אֱלֹהַי, אִם־עָשִׂיתִי זֹאת; אִם־יֶשׁ־עָוֶל בְּכַפָּי” — “O YHWH my God, if I have done this; if there is injustice in my hands” (v. 4). The demonstrative “זֹאת” is deliberately vague: whatever the accusation is, I swear against it. The third clause tightens: “אִם־גָּמַלְתִּי שׁוֹלְמִי רָע; וָאֲחַלְּצָה צֹרְרִי רֵיקָם” — “if I repaid my ally with evil; [yet] I rescued my enemy for nothing” (v. 5). The syntax staggers; the defense interrupts the oath formula as if the thought of injustice cannot be left unsaid. “שׁוֹלְמִי” is a covenantal word (“one at peace with me”); “צֹרְרִי” is the declared foe. David’s story is full of such inversions: cutting Saul’s robe, yet sparing Saul’s life (1 Sam 24); refusing to kill when urged to strike (26:8–11). The verb “חָלַץ” can mean “to deliver” (Radak, Meiri), while Rashi brilliantly hears a pun on “stripping”—David “stripped” Saul’s cloak but spared Saul’s person. The oath closes with a self-curse that reads like a verdict: “יִרְדֹף אוֹיֵב נַפְשִׁי… וְיִרְמֹס לָאָרֶץ חַיִּי; וּכְבוֹדִי לֶעָפָר יִשְׁכֵּן. סֶלָה” — “then let the enemy pursue my life… trample my life to the ground; and let my honor dwell in the dust. Selah” (v. 6). Not only bodily death but the “dwelling” of “כָּבוֹד” (reputation) in dust: social annihilation.

With “Selah” (a liturgical pause), the poem changes register. Three imperatives—“ק֘וּמָ֤ה… הִנָּשֵׂא… וְעוּרָה” (v. 7)—summon God as warrior and judge. This is the old ark-cry—“Arise, YHWH” (Num 10:35)—refitted as legal motion: “Awake for me to the judgment You commanded” (מִשְׁפָּט צִוִּיתָ). The scene goes cosmic: “וַעֲדַת לְאֻמִּים תְּסוֹבְבֶךָּ; וְעָלֶיהָ לַמָּרוֹם שׁוּבָה” — “Let the assembly of peoples surround You; over it, return to the height” (v. 8). The phrase “עֲדַת לְאֻמִּים” is rare. It can mean Israel as a congregation of tribes (Radak, citing Gen 28:3; 35:11) or the nations as an earthwide audience—perhaps even the heavenly council (cf. Ps 82:1: “אֱלֹהִים נִצָּב בַּעֲדַת אֵל; בְּקֶרֶב אֱלֹהִים יִשְׁפֹּט” — “God takes His stand in the assembly of El; in the midst of the divine beings He judges”). The ambiguity is on purpose. Personal vindication is pleaded as a test case of universal justice: “יְהוָה יָדִין עַמִּים; שָׁפְטֵנִי יְהוָה כְּצִדְקִי וּכְתֻמִּי עָלָי” — “YHWH judges the peoples; judge me, O YHWH, according to my righteousness and my integrity that is upon me” (v. 9). This is not a claim of sinlessness; it is a courtroom plea: judge me “in this matter.”

The pivot (vv. 10–12) is theological and anthropological. “יִגְמַר־נָא רַע רְשָׁעִים; וּתְכוֹנֵן צַדִּיק” — “Let the evil of the wicked come to an end; and establish the righteous.” Why the confidence? Because God “בֹחֵן לִבּוֹת וּכְלָיוֹת” — “probes hearts and kidneys” (v. 10). In biblical usage the “heart” is mind and will; “kidneys” are the seat of conscience and deep emotion (cf. Jer 11:20: “בֹּחֵן כְּלָיוֹת וָלֵב” — “Tester of kidneys and heart”). The next line is notorious: “אֱלֹהִים שׁוֹפֵט צַדִּיק, וְאֵל זֹעֵם בְּכָל־יוֹם” (v. 12). Read as two clauses—“God judges (for) the righteous; and a God who is angry every day”—it balances advocacy and warning. The Septuagint expands: “God is a righteous judge and strong and longsuffering,” reading patience into the daily anger. The Hebrew text’s tension is better theology: divine justice is not postponed indefinitely; moral weather patterns hold.

The final movement is as shrewd as it is visceral. If the wrongdoer “does not turn back,” weapons appear. But whose? “חַרְבּוֹ יִלְטוֹשׁ; קַשְׁתּוֹ דָּרַךְ וַיְכֹונְנֶהָ” — “He whets his sword; bends his bow and makes it ready” (v. 13). Is this God’s arsenal aimed at the wicked (Rashi), or the wicked man’s arsenal that will misfire (Ibn Ezra)? The ambiguity belongs to wisdom. Psalm 11 similarly pictures wicked archers bending bows against the upright (11:2), but in Psalm 18 God sends His own arrows: “וַיִּשְׁלַח חִצָּיו וַיְפִיצֵם” — “He sent His arrows and scattered them” (18:15). In Psalm 7, the poet collapses the two mechanisms: the world is so made that arms raised against others return to the assailant. Three images make the point: (1) ill-fated weaponry (vv. 13–14); (2) moral pregnancy whose birth is “שָׁקֶר,” a lie (v. 15; cf. Isa 59:4: “הָר֥וּ עָמָ֖ל וְיָלְד֥וּ אָוֶֽן” — “They conceive mischief and bear iniquity”); (3) the pit whose digger falls in (vv. 16–17; cf. Prov 26:27; Ps 9:16: “בְּרֶשֶׁת־זוּ טָמָנוּ נִלְכְּדָה רַגְלָם”). The law here is not statute but physics.

The vow of praise (v. 18) completes the arc: “אוֹדֶה יְהוָה כְּצִדְקוֹ; וַאֲזַמְּרָה שֵׁם יְהוָה עֶלְיוֹן” — “I will thank YHWH for His righteousness; I will sing to the name of YHWH Most High.” “עֶלְיוֹן” (Most High) answers “לַמָּרוֹם” (on high) from v. 8; the God summoned to take the bench is disclosed as sovereign. And “according to His righteousness” (כְּצִדְקוֹ) quietly matches the earlier plea “כְּצִדְקִי” (v. 9). The poet asked to be judged by his righteousness in this case; he ends by praising God’s righteousness in every case.

Two brief definitions for readers: by “colon” we mean a single poetic line within a parallel pair; by “inclusio” we mean a framing device where words or themes at the beginning recur at the end to enclose the whole. Psalm 7 is rich in both. It is also rich in moral weather—the sense that judgment is not only what God does but how the world works under God’s rule. The psalm is not an abstract theodicy; it is a defendant’s cry, lodged in the court of the Most High and grounded in the grammar of reality.

#### Key verses

“ק֘וּמָ֤ה יְהֹוָ֨ה ׀ בְּאַפֶּ֗ךָ… וְע֥וּרָה אֵ֝לַ֗י מִשְׁפָּ֥ט צִוִּֽיתָ” — “Arise, O LORD, in Your anger… awake for me to the judgment You commanded” (Ps 7:7). In the Edot ha-Mizrach tradition this verse is recited before the shofar in the Rosh Hashanah Seder Tekiat Shofar. The surrounding text appeals for God’s awakened judgment as the shofar sounds: “קוּמָה ה׳ בְּאַפֶּךָ… הוֹצִיאָה מִמַּסְגֵּר נַפְשִׁי לְהוֹדוֹת אֶת־שְׁמֶךָ” (“Arise, O LORD… Bring my soul out of confinement to give thanks to Your name”). The High Holiday setting hears the verse as summons to just mercy and decisive rule.

“אֱלֹהִים שׁוֹפֵט” — “God [is] judge” (Ps 7:12). Ashkenazi communities weave this formula into devotional piyyutim before Yom Kippur night’s Maariv, often alongside justice-language: “שֶׁמֶשׁ וּמָגֵן יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים, שׁוֹפֵט צֶדֶק וּמַשְׁפִּיל גְּבוֹהִים” — “Sun and shield is the LORD our God, God the Judge of righteousness who humbles the lofty.” Here Psalm 7’s judicial theology becomes the liturgical keynote of the Day of Judgment.

#### Phrases

“עֲמָלוֹ בְּרֹאשׁוֹ” — “his mischief [returns] upon his head” (Ps 7:17). In the Sefard rite this phrase is echoed in Shabbat ha-Gadol piyyutim: “לֹבֵשׁ צֶדֶק נֶאְזָר… עֲמָלוֹ בְרֹאשׁוֹ חָזָר” — “He is clothed in righteousness… his mischief returned upon his head.” The line is enlisted to celebrate the Passover reversal, where hostile designs recoil upon their makers—a liturgical appropriation of Psalm 7’s retributive law.
