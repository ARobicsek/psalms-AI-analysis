# Verse-by-Verse Commentary: Psalm 7

## Verse 1

**שִׁגָּי֗וֹן לְדָ֫וִ֥ד אֲשֶׁר־שָׁ֥ר לַֽיהֹוָ֑ה עַל־דִּבְרֵי־כ֝֗וּשׁ בֶּן־יְמִינִֽי׃**

"A *shiggaion* of David, which he sang to the LORD; concerning the words of Cush, a Benjaminite."

The superscription confronts us with two enigmas that frame everything that follows. The first is the genre designation שִׁגָּי֗וֹן (*shiggaion*), appearing elsewhere only in Habakkuk 3:1, where it introduces that prophet's wild theophanic vision of divine warrior fury. The Klein Dictionary's etymology connects it to Arabic *sajʿ* (rhymed prose), but the BDB lexicon's proposal is more compelling: deriving from שָׁגָה (to reel, stagger), it indicates "wild, passionate song, with rapid changes of rhythm." This single term signals that what follows will be urgent, unsteady—poetry written from the edge. The Targum's rendering as a prayer sung "with a musical instrument" misses the emotional urgency entirely; Rashi's connection to שְׁגָגָה (error), suggesting David erred by prematurely celebrating Saul's downfall, transforms the term into retrospective theological judgment rather than capturing the genre's intrinsic volatility.

The second enigma is "כ֝֗וּשׁ בֶּן־יְמִינִֽי" ("Cush, a Benjaminite"). No such figure appears anywhere else in Scripture. The Midrash (Moed Katan 16b) identifies him with Saul himself through wordplay: "Just as the Cushite is distinctive in his skin, so Saul was distinctive in his deeds"—כּוּשׁ meaning Ethiopian, a person of visibly different appearance. This is not mere allegory but political necessity: Benjamin was Saul's tribe (1 Samuel 9:1-2), and if this psalm originates in David's fugitive years, diplomatic circumlocution—calling the king "Cush" rather than naming him—becomes strategic prudence. Radak and Malbim concur: "This psalm was uttered concerning Saul. And he calls him Cush because he was distinctive in his beauty, as the Cushite woman (Numbers 12:1)." The superscription thus establishes the psalm's genre (passionate juridical plea), protagonist (David), defendant (a powerful Benjaminite, likely Saul), and forum (divine court). What follows is a legal brief presented to the cosmic tribunal when earthly courts have catastrophically failed.

## Verse 2

**יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱ֭לֹהַי בְּךָ֣ חָסִ֑יתִי; הוֹשִׁיעֵ֥נִי מִכׇּל־רֹ֝דְפַ֗י וְהַצִּילֵֽנִי׃**

"O LORD, my God, in You I seek refuge; deliver me from all my pursuers and save me."

The opening gambit employs the compound divine address יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱ֭לֹהַי, which appears eleven times in Psalms, always in contexts of extreme distress (Psalms 7:2, 4; 13:4; 30:3; 35:24; 38:22). The juxtaposition is significant: יְהֹוָה (YHWH), the covenant name revealing God's character through salvific history, paired with אֱ֭לֹהַי (my God), the possessive form asserting personal relationship. Rashi glosses: "Not with the help of flesh and blood." The speaker stakes his claim not on royal favor or military alliance but on covenant fidelity.

The perfect tense verb חָסִ֑יתִי ("I have taken refuge") is critical. Unlike the following imperatives הוֹשִׁיעֵ֥נִי ("save me") and וְהַצִּילֵֽנִי ("deliver me"), this completed action establishes the juridical basis for the petition: refuge has already been sought and granted. The verb חָסָה appears fifty-seven times in Scripture, predominantly in Psalms, with a technical meaning: to seek asylum in a sanctuary or under a protector's authority. The Dead Sea Scrolls Community Rule (1QS) uses this terminology for joining the Yahad: "all who seek refuge in His truth" (1QS 1:7). Here, as in Psalm 11:1 ("בַּֽיהֹוָ֨ה חָסִ֗יתִי"), the perfect tense asserts a completed legal transaction: asylum has been claimed under divine protection.

The parallelism of הוֹשִׁיעֵ֥נִי ("deliver me") and וְהַצִּילֵֽנִי ("save me") creates redundancy for urgency. But there's semantic distinction: הוֹשִׁיעַ (from יָשַׁע) connotes victory or triumph, often in military contexts (Exodus 14:30: "Thus the LORD saved [וַיּ֨וֹשַׁע] Israel that day from the Egyptians"), while הִצִּיל (from נָצַל) means to snatch away, to extract from danger (Genesis 37:21: "Reuben sought to rescue him [לְהַצִּיל֖וֹ] from their hands"). The psalmist wants both: deliverance from immediate threat *and* ultimate vindication. The phrase מִכׇּל־רֹ֝דְפַ֗י ("from all my pursuers") uses the plural, suggesting not one enemy but a coordinated faction—precisely the situation described in 1 Samuel 24:26, where Saul takes "three thousand chosen men from all Israel" to hunt David.

## Verse 3

**פֶּן־יִטְרֹ֣ף כְּאַרְיֵ֣ה נַפְשִׁ֑י; פֹּ֝רֵ֗ק וְאֵ֣ין מַצִּֽיל׃**

"Lest, like a lion, he tear my soul apart; rending it, and there is none to deliver."

The shift from plural "pursuers" (v. 2) to singular predator here performs a rhetorical concentration: multiple enemies coalesce into one archetypal threat. The simile כְּאַרְיֵ֣ה ("like a lion") appears seventy-eight times in Scripture, frequently for royal power (Genesis 49:9, "Judah is a lion's whelp," גּ֤וּר אַרְיֵה֙ יְהוּדָ֔ה) or divine judgment (Hosea 5:14, "For I am like a lion [כַּשַּׁ֙חַל֙] to Ephraim"). The phonetic transcription reveals the verse's hunting rhythm: `pen-yit-**RŌF** kə-'ar-**YĒH** naf-**SHIY** pō-**RĒQ**`. Note the stressed syllables fall on the violence verbs—RŌF (tear), RĒQ (rend)—creating an auditory enactment of predatory attack.

The verb יִטְרֹף (from טָרַף, "to tear, rend") is technical terminology for predation. BDB documents its use for wild animals seizing prey: "torn by beasts" (טְרֵפָה, Exodus 22:12). But biblical authors exploit this term's shock value for political violence. Ezekiel 22:25 accuses Israel's princes: "Her princes within her are like a roaring lion tearing prey [כַּאֲרִי שׁוֹאֵג טֹרֵף טָרֶף]; they devour people." The figurative language database shows the lion metaphor appears fifteen times across Scripture, predominantly for royal or military threat. Here the traditional commentary tradition unanimously identifies the "lion" as Saul. Radak states: "This could not be said of any other enemy of David except Saul, who was king; and of him it is said, 'Rending in pieces while there is none to deliver.'"

The second verb פֹּרֵק ("rending") comes from פָּרַק (to break off, tear away). Rashi glosses it with Exodus 32:2: "Break off (פָּרְקוּ) the golden rings." The Klein Dictionary notes cognates in Aramaic and Syriac meaning "to redeem, rescue"—but also "to separate from, break loose." Here it conveys dismemberment, the breaking apart of joints and limbs. Metzudat David comments: "He will break me apart and I will find no deliverer, for all have risen against me."

The closing clause וְאֵ֣ין מַצִּֽיל ("and there is none to deliver") employs the active participle מַצִּֽיל (one who delivers), creating bitter irony: the psalmist just petitioned God הוֹשִׁיעֵ֥נִי... וְהַצִּילֵֽנִי ("deliver me... save me," v. 2), but in human terms, אֵ֣ין מַצִּֽיל—there is no deliverer. The absence of human help makes the divine petition not optional but necessary. This motif of lone vulnerability without human aid appears throughout the Davidic tradition: "I looked for someone to show pity, but there was none [וָאַ֑יִן], for comforters, but I found none [וְלֹ֣א מָצָֽאתִי]" (Psalm 69:21).

## Verse 4

**יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱ֭לֹהַי אִם־עָשִׂ֣יתִי זֹ֑את; אִֽם־יֶשׁ־עָ֥וֶל בְּכַפָּֽי׃**

"O LORD, my God, if I have done this; if there is wrongdoing in my hands."

The juridical section begins with the compound divine address repeated from verse 2, framing the oath of innocence within the same covenantal relationship. The triple אִם (im, "if") structure (vv. 4-5) mirrors Ancient Near Eastern treaty curses and biblical covenant formulas. In Hittite vassal treaties, the curse formula begins "If you, [vassal name], do not..." followed by specified violations and corresponding punishments. Psalm 7's structure is parallel: "If I have done X... then let Y happen to me" (v. 6).

But what is זֹאת ("this")? The demonstrative pronoun points backward—but to what? Rashi suggests: "What is delineated after it"—the specific accusations in verse 5. But the vagueness is rhetorically effective: the psalmist swears against whatever accusation has been leveled, without dignifying it by repetition. This is the strategy of one confident in innocence: let the accuser specify the charge; I swear against all possibilities.

The second conditional אִֽם־יֶשׁ־עָ֥וֶל בְּכַפָּֽי ("if there is wrongdoing in my hands") shifts from completed action (עָשִׂיתִי, "I have done") to static condition (יֶשׁ, "there is"). The term עָוֶל appears twenty-one times in biblical Hebrew, meaning "injustice, unrighteousness" (BDB). Job uses it in his own oath of innocence: "If I have walked with falsehood... if my step has turned from the way, and my heart followed my eyes, and if any spot adheres to my hands [וּבְכַפַּי דָּבַק מוּם]" (Job 31:5-7). The metaphor of hands (כַפַּי) metonymically represents agency—hands execute what the heart intends. Metzudat David captures the force: "Did I do wrongdoing to degrade him, making him stand clothed in a torn garment like the lowly?" This refers to 1 Samuel 24:5, where David cut off the corner of Saul's robe—an act that, despite its restraint, haunted David's conscience: "Afterward, David was conscience-stricken [וַיַּךְ֩ לֵב־דָּוִ֨ד אֹת֜וֹ] for having cut off a corner of Saul's robe" (1 Samuel 24:6).

The oath's power derives from its publicity. In Israel's juridical system, oath-taking invoked divine witness and sanction. Numbers 5:11-31 prescribes an oath ritual for a woman accused of adultery: she must drink "bitter water" and swear "אָמֵן אָמֵן" (Amen, amen)—if guilty, the curse takes effect; if innocent, she is cleared. Psalm 7 operates similarly: the oath itself, uttered in Yahweh's presence, initiates the divine adjudication process.

## Verse 5

**אִם־גָּ֭מַלְתִּי שֽׁוֹלְמִ֥י רָ֑ע; וָאֲחַלְּצָ֖ה צֽוֹרְרִ֥י רֵיקָֽם׃**

"If I have requited my ally with evil—I who rescued my enemy without cause!"

The third אִם clause disrupts the expected oath formula with a parenthetical counter-claim. Structurally, we expect: "If I have done X, if Y is true, if Z has occurred, *then* let me be cursed." But here the psalmist cannot contain himself—mid-oath, he interrupts with exculpatory evidence. The grammar enacts the disrupted justice: the accused breaks into his own testimony.

The phrase אִם־גָּ֭מַלְתִּי שֽׁוֹלְמִ֥י רָ֑ע ("if I requited my ally with evil") uses the verb גָּמַל (to deal with, requite), which appears thirty-four times in Scripture. Its semantic range includes both positive recompense (Psalm 13:6, "I will sing to the LORD, for He has dealt bountifully with me," כִּֽי־גָמַ֥ל עָלָֽי) and negative retribution (Obadiah 1:15, "As you have done, it shall be done to you; your deeds shall return on your own head," כַּאֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשִׂ֔יתָ יֵעָשֶׂ֖ה לָּ֑ךְ גְּמֻלְךָ֖ יָשׁ֥וּב בְּרֹאשֶֽׁךָ). Here it denotes returning evil for evil—the lex talionis gone wrong.

But who is שֽׁוֹלְמִי ("my ally")? The term from שָׁלֵם (to be complete, whole, at peace) denotes one in covenant relationship, an ally bound by treaty or kinship. Radak explains: "One who was at peace with me, as he [Saul] does to me, who was at peace with him and was his son-in-law and fought his battles—and he repays me evil for good!" First Samuel documents this relationship: David became Saul's son-in-law (1 Samuel 18:27), his court musician (16:21-23), and his general (18:5). They were not neutral parties but covenant allies. The accusation—whatever it was—thus violated fundamental loyalty obligations.

The parenthetical protest וָאֲחַלְּצָ֖ה צֽוֹרְרִ֥י רֵיקָֽם ("I who rescued my enemy without cause!") is syntactically jarring. The verb חָלַץ (to draw out, deliver) appears forty-four times, often in military contexts: "he rescued them from their distress" (Psalm 107:6, וַיַּצִּילֵם מִמְּצֽוּקוֹתֵיהֶֽם). Rashi glosses: "I destroyed his garment when I cut the corner of his coat... did I do it to destroy and strip him and leave him empty? Only to let him know he was delivered into my hand to kill him, and I did not kill him." The reference is unmistakable: 1 Samuel 24 and 26 record David twice sparing Saul's life despite opportunity and encouragement to kill him. In the cave at En-gedi: "David's men said to him, 'This is the day of which the LORD said to you, "Behold, I will give your enemy into your hand..."' So David arose and cut off the corner of Saul's robe" (24:4). Later, in Saul's camp: "Abishai said to David, 'God has delivered your enemy into your hand today; now let me pin him to the ground with one thrust of the spear...' But David said, 'Do not destroy him'" (26:8-9).

The adverb רֵיקָֽם ("without cause," "for nothing," "empty-handed") appears sixteen times, always emphasizing the gratuity of an action. Exodus 3:21 promises the Israelites will not leave Egypt רֵיקָֽם, "empty-handed." Here it stresses the moral inversion: not only did David refrain from harming his ally, he even rescued his active enemy—and received persecution as reward. Malbim catches the legal force: "The parenthetical claim interrupts the oath structure... as if David cannot contain his indignation long enough to finish the legal boilerplate."

## Verse 6

**יִ֥רַדֹּֽף־אוֹיֵ֨ב נַפְשִׁ֡י וְיַשֵּׂ֗ג, וְיִרְמֹ֣ס לָאָ֣רֶץ חַיָּ֑י; וּכְבוֹדִ֓י לֶעָפָ֖ר יַשְׁכֵּ֣ן סֶֽלָה׃**

"Let the enemy pursue and overtake my soul, and trample my life to the ground; and make my honor dwell in the dust. *Selah.*"

The oath's apodosis—the "then let this happen" consequence—finally arrives. The conditional self-curse follows Ancient Near Eastern legal forms where oaths invoke catastrophic consequences upon oath-breakers. The Hittite Soldier's Oath includes: "Just as this bread was once standing grain... but is now burned with fire, so may the enemy burn up anyone who breaks this oath" (CTH 427). Deuteronomy 28's covenant curses operate similarly: "If you do not obey... then all these curses shall come upon you" (28:15).

The curse unfolds through three verbs of violence: יִרַדֹּף (pursue), וְיַשֵּׂג (overtake), וְיִרְמֹס (trample). The sequence creates narrative progression—hunting imagery moves from pursuit to capture to execution. The verb רָמַס (to trample) appears nineteen times, often for military defeat: "You trampled down those who rejected Your statutes" (Psalm 119:118, סָלִיתָ כׇּל־שֹׁוגִים מֵחֻקֶּיךָ). Isaiah uses it for imperial conquest: "All of them shall be trampled like refuse in the streets" (10:6, לִהְיוֹת מִרְמָס כְּטִיט חוּצוֹת). The preposition לָאָרֶץ (to the ground) makes the humiliation spatial—from upright standing to prostrate abasement.

But the curse's climax is not physical but social death: וּכְבוֹדִ֓י לֶעָפָ֖ר יַשְׁכֵּ֣ן ("and my honor to the dust shall dwell"). The term כָּבוֹד here does not mean God's glory (as in Exodus 16:7, "you shall see the glory of the LORD," וּרְאִיתֶם אֶת־כְּבוֹד יְהֹוָה) but human honor, social standing. Job mourns: "My honor (*kavod*) was not renewed in me" (29:20)—referring to his lost reputation. Proverbs warns: "He who seeks evil, evil will come to him, and he who seeks honor (*kavod*), honor will find him" (11:27). The verb שָׁכַן (to dwell, abide) typically describes long-term residence. Psalm 68:17 celebrates: "This is the mountain where God chooses to dwell [לִשְׁכָּן], where the LORD will abide [יִשְׁכֹּן] forever." Here the permanence is inverted—honor making its eternal home in dust, reputation permanently obliterated.

The progression from נַפְשִׁי (my soul/life) to חַיָּי (my life) to כְבוֹדִי (my honor) traces the descent from animation to existence to social identity. Malbim notes: "It is fitting that the enemy pursue my soul [life force] and moreover overtake it and trample my *life* [biological existence] to the ground, and beyond this, even my *honor* shall dwell in the dust—as if he killed me justly, according to law and judgment, for my sin, so that I should remain silent about this." The curse acknowledges that false accusation, if successful, destroys not just the body but the legacy—the ongoing life one has in communal memory.

The single סֶֽלָה marking this section's end signals a major structural division. Occurring seventy-one times in Psalms, this liturgical-musical term (etymology uncertain—possibly "lift up," from סָלַל) marks pauses for emphasis or instrumental interlude. The Targum renders it "forever" (לְעָלַם); the Septuagint transliterates it as διάψαλμα (diapsalma, "musical interlude"). Here it creates rhetorical suspense: the oath is complete—now what will God do?

## Verse 7

**ק֘וּמָ֤ה יְהֹוָ֨ה בְּאַפֶּ֗ךָ, הִ֭נָּשֵׂא בְּעַבְר֣וֹת צוֹרְרָ֑י; וְע֥וּרָה אֵ֝לַ֗י, מִשְׁפָּ֥ט צִוִּֽיתָ׃**

"Arise, O LORD, in Your anger; lift Yourself up against the fury of my foes; and awaken for me—You have ordained judgment."

The rhetorical explosion here—three imperatives hammering at heaven—represents one of Scripture's boldest modes of address to deity. The phonetic transcription reveals the urgency: `**QŪ**-māh yə-hō-**WĀH** bə-'a-**PE**-khā hin-nā-**SĒ'** bə-ʿav-**RŌTH** tsō-rə-**RĀY** wə-**ʿŪ**-rāh`. Each stressed syllable falls on a command verb (QŪmah, SĒ', ʿŪrah) or divine name (WĀH), creating a percussive summons.

The imperative קוּמָה ("arise!") appears in theophanic battle contexts. Numbers 10:35 records the ancient war cry: "When the ark set out, Moses would say, 'Arise [קוּמָה], O LORD, and let Your enemies be scattered!'" Psalm 68:2 echoes: "Let God arise [יָקוּם אֱלֹהִים], let His enemies be scattered." The verb's semantic range includes rising from sleep, standing from sitting, or taking action from passivity. Radak glosses: "Arise—from the appearance of inactivity." The complaint is not that God is literally asleep but that divine justice appears dormant while persecution rages.

The second imperative הִנָּשֵׂא ("lift Yourself up") is more unusual—a Niphal form of נָשָׂא (to lift, carry, bear). The reflexive sense ("lift *Yourself*") appears only here and in Isaiah 33:10: "Now I will arise [קוּם], now I will lift Myself up [אֵרוֹמֵם], now I will be exalted [אִנָּשֵׂא]." The phrase בְּעַבְרוֹת צוֹרְרָי is grammatically challenging. The term עַבְרוֹת (from עֶבְרָה, "wrath, fury") appears as "overflowing rage" in Job 21:30: "The wicked are spared in the day of calamity, they are rescued in the day of wrath [עֶבְרָה]." BDB defines עֶבְרָה as "overflow, arrogance, fury." Here it could mean "against the outbursts of rage of my foes" or possibly "against the transgressions (*ʿavaroth* from עָבַר, transgress?) of my foes." The ambiguity may be deliberate—rise up against both their rage *and* their wrongdoing.

The third imperative עוּרָה ("awaken!") appears twenty-two times, often in theophanic contexts. Isaiah 51:9 cries: "Awake, awake [עוּרִי עוּרִי], put on strength, O arm of the LORD!" Here the shift from third person ("upon my foes") to first person ("for me," אֵלַי) makes the plea intimate—not just general justice but personal vindication.

The final clause מִשְׁפָּט צִוִּיתָ ("You have ordained judgment") transforms the petition from request to demand. The verb צִוָּה (to command, ordain) indicates prior divine decree. What judgment has been ordained? Malbim suggests the Davidic covenant: "The judgment is the judgment of kingship which You commanded concerning me through Samuel." First Samuel 16:1 records God's command: "I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have selected [רָאִיתִי] a king for Myself among his sons." But there's a deeper claim here: Torah itself ordains justice. Deuteronomy 16:20 commands: "Justice, justice shall you pursue [צֶדֶק צֶדֶק תִּרְדֹּף]." The psalmist thus argues: I'm not asking You to do something new—I'm demanding You enforce Your own revealed will. This is the genius of biblical petition: it holds God accountable not to human standards but to divine self-revelation.

This verse appears in the Seder Tekiat Shofar for Rosh Hashanah in the Edot HaMizrach tradition, part of a series of verses preceding the shofar blowing. The liturgical context transforms David's personal plea into Israel's corporate petition: the community, standing before God on the Day of Judgment, invokes these ancient words to awaken divine justice and mercy. The shofar itself—the instrument of theophany (Exodus 19:16), jubilee liberation (Leviticus 25:9), and eschatological ingathering (Isaiah 27:13)—becomes the acoustic embodiment of this verse's cry: ק֘וּמָ֤ה יְהֹוָ֨ה, "Arise, O LORD!"

## Verse 8

**וַעֲדַ֣ת לְ֭אֻמִּים תְּסֽוֹבְבֶ֑ךָּ; וְ֝עָלֶ֗יהָ לַמָּר֥וֹם שֽׁוּבָה׃**

"Let the assembly of peoples surround You; and over it, return on high."

The scope suddenly explodes from individual case to universal drama. The phrase עֲדַת לְאֻמִּים ("assembly of peoples") appears only here in Scripture, though its components are common. עֵדָה (assembly, congregation) typically refers to Israel's gathered community—Exodus 12:3 commands "כׇּל־עֲדַת יִשְׂרָאֵל" ("the whole congregation of Israel"). But לְאֻמִּים (peoples, nations) usually denotes plural *goyim*-like entities. Genesis 25:23 uses it for Rebekah's twins: "Two nations [גּוֹיִם] are in your womb, two peoples [לְאֻמִּים] shall be separated from within you." Isaiah 51:4 provides the parallel: "Give heed to Me, My people, and give ear to Me, My nation [לְאוֹם]; for Torah will go forth from Me" (כִּי תוֹרָה מֵאִתִּי תֵצֵא).

Medieval commentators divide on interpretation. Radak insists these are Israel's twelve tribes: "The *edah* is the congregation of Israel which includes them all; *leummim* are the twelve tribes of Israel. They are called *leummim*, *ammim* (peoples), and *goyim* (nations), as Isaac said to Jacob: 'You shall become an assembly of peoples [קְהַל עַמִּים]' (Genesis 28:3); and God said to Jacob: 'A nation and an assembly of nations shall come from you [גּוֹי וּקְהַל גּוֹיִם יִהְיֶה מִמֶּךָּ]' (Genesis 35:11)." This reading sees David's case as representative—when God judges him justly, all Israel witnesses divine righteousness.

But others hear echoes of divine council imagery. Psalm 82:1 pictures God judging "בַּעֲדַת־אֵל" ("in the assembly of El"). The Ugaritic Baal Cycle describes El enthroned "in the assembly of the gods" (KTU 1.2 i 14-20). Whether the psalmist imagines earthly nations gathered (like Joel 4:2, "I will gather all the nations [כׇּל־הַגּוֹיִם]") or heavenly beings convened, the rhetorical effect is the same: maximum publicity for the verdict. A wrongful judgment whispered in private is unjust; true justice requires public witness.

The verb תְּסֽוֹבְבֶךָּ (let them surround You) from סָבַב (to surround, encircle) appears 154 times, often for military siege (2 Kings 6:14, "they surrounded the city," וַיָּסֹבּוּ עַל־הָעִיר). Here it creates visual theater—God enthroned centrally, nations circling in concentric witness. The Song of Songs uses this verb for joyous gathering: "Threescore mighty men surround it [סְבִיבֹתֶיהָ]" (3:7). The spatial imagery prepares for the vertical movement in the second colon.

The phrase וְעָלֶיהָ לַמָּרוֹם שׁוּבָה is syntactically difficult. Literally: "and over it, to the height, return." The preposition עָלֶיהָ (over it) refers to the assembly just mentioned. לַמָּרוֹם (to the height) from מָרוֹם (high place, height) appears fifty-four times, frequently for God's dwelling: "He looks down from His lofty height [מִמְּרוֹם]" (Psalm 102:20). The verb שׁוּבָה (return, go back) is imperative—but return from where? Ibn Ezra suggests: "Go back to Your place—leave them and ascend." Radak offers: "Over it—concerning this assembly—take Your seat on high," reading שׁוּב as "assume position" rather than "return." 

Malbim provides the most nuanced reading, seeing this as conditional: if the accusers persist in their עַבְרוֹת (transgressions/fury, v. 7), "then return on high over them"—that is, withdraw Your presence from them in judgment. This recalls Moses' intercession in Exodus 32:12: "Turn from Your fierce anger [שׁוּב מֵחֲרוֹן אַפֶּךָ] and relent concerning the evil against Your people." The difference is stark—here the withdrawal is punitive, not merciful.

The inclusio between לַמָּרוֹם (on high, v. 8) and עֶלְיוֹן (Most High, v. 18) frames the entire psalm. God summoned to rise becomes God revealed as eternally sovereign. The forensic drama transforms cosmic geography: the judge who seemed absent is disclosed as enthroned above all powers.

## Verse 9

**יְהֹוָה֮ יָדִ֢ין עַ֫מִּ֥ים; שׇׁפְטֵ֥נִי יְהֹוָ֑ה כְּצִדְקִ֖י וּכְתֻמִּ֣י עָלָֽי׃**

"The LORD judges the peoples; judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness and my integrity which is upon me."

The double judicial vocabulary here—דִּין (pronounce judgment) and שָׁפַט (judge, govern)—creates semantic distinction. The verb יָדִין (judges) from דִּין appears twenty-four times, often in contexts of legal dispute and contention. Deuteronomy 32:36 declares: "For the LORD will judge [יָדִין] His people, and have compassion on His servants." The verb carries connotations of verdict and vindication. שָׁפַט, appearing 203 times, has broader range—to judge, govern, plead causes, execute judgment. When Samuel is described as שֹׁפֵט (judge) over Israel (1 Samuel 7:6), it includes administrative and military leadership, not just legal decisions.

The shift from declarative "The LORD judges peoples" to imperative "Judge me, O LORD" moves from general principle to specific application. The structure mirrors legal argumentation: (1) You are the universal judge of all peoples; (2) Therefore judge *me*, a particular case within Your jurisdiction. The plural עַמִּים (peoples) links to לְאֻמִּים (peoples) in verse 8—David's vindication occurs in the context of God's cosmic adjudication.

The bold claim "according to my righteousness" (כְּצִדְקִי) has troubled commentators who recall Paul's polemic against "establishing their own righteousness" (Romans 10:3). But the psalmist makes no claim to sinlessness—only to innocence of *this specific charge*. The כְּ prefix indicates proportion or correspondence: "judge me *in accordance with* the righteousness I possess in *this matter*." Job employs identical logic: "I hold fast my righteousness [בְּצִדְקָתִי] and will not let it go; my heart does not reproach me for any of my days" (27:6). This is not self-righteousness but the assertion of standing in court. A defendant claims not to be perfect, but to be not guilty of the alleged crime.

The parallel phrase וּכְתֻמִּי עָלָי ("and according to my integrity which is upon me") adds ethical wholeness to legal innocence. The noun תֹּם (integrity, completeness) from תָּמַם (to be complete, finished) appears twenty-five times, often for blameless moral character. Job's opening: "There was a man... *tam* and upright [תָּם וְיָשָׁר]" (Job 1:1). Proverbs 10:9 contrasts: "He who walks in integrity [תֹּם] walks securely, but he who perverts his ways will be found out." The phrase עָלָי (upon me, with me) makes this integrity something *worn* or *borne*—visible to divine scrutiny but also to the surrounding community.

This verse captures the psalm's central paradox: David petitions God to judge him righteously while simultaneously asserting his own righteousness. This is not contradiction but the necessary structure of juridical innocence. In a corrupted earthly court, the innocent must appeal to a higher jurisdiction, and such appeal requires assertion of grounds—not "I am generally good" but "I am not guilty of what I am accused." The psalm thus navigates between total dependence on divine mercy and vigorous assertion of innocence. The apparent tension resolves when we recognize these are not contradictory theological positions but complementary legal strategies: trust in the judge's character, confidence in one's case.

## Verse 10

**יִגְמׇר־נָ֬א רַ֨ע רְשָׁעִים֮ וּתְכוֹנֵ֢ן צַ֫דִּ֥יק; וּבֹחֵ֣ן לִ֭בּוֹת וּכְלָי֗וֹת אֱלֹהִ֥ים צַדִּֽיק׃**

"Let the evil of the wicked come to an end, and establish the righteous; You who probe hearts and kidneys, O righteous God."

The petition יִגְמׇר־נָא רַע ("let the evil come to an end") employs the verb גָּמַר, which appears fifty-seven times with meanings spanning "complete, finish, cease, fail." The particle נָא (now, please) adds urgency—not "eventually let evil end" but "please, bring it to completion now." Rashi interprets: "Let the evil that the wicked do bring them to an end and destroy them." This reading treats רַע (evil) as subject and רְשָׁעִים (wicked ones) as object—"let [the] evil [of] the wicked be finished with them." An alternate parsing treats רַע as object: "Bring the evil of the wicked to its conclusion," implying evil has run its course and now faces reckoning.

The parallel petition וּתְכוֹנֵן צַדִּיק ("and establish the righteous") uses כּוּן (Polel stem), "to establish firmly, set up." This verb appears 219 times, frequently for establishing thrones (Psalm 89:5, "I will establish your seed forever [אָכִין זַרְעֲךָ עַד־עוֹלָם]") and foundations (Proverbs 3:19, "The LORD by wisdom founded the earth [יָסַד אָרֶץ]"). The righteous (צַדִּיק) is to be not merely vindicated but *established*—given secure, stable position. The asymmetry is notable: the wicked face termination, the righteous face establishment. Justice is not symmetrical punishment but restorative ordering.

The forensic confidence rests on divine omniscience: וּבֹחֵן לִבּוֹת וּכְלָיוֹת ("who probes hearts and kidneys").
