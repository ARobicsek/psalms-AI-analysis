# Editorial Assessment (College Edition) - Psalm 18

The existing introduction and commentary clearly come from someone who knows the scholarship very well. The macro-structure of the psalm is well mapped; the “double narration” (God’s cosmic rescue vs. David’s battle) is a helpful insight; ANE storm‑god background, the *migdol/magdil* issue, and the problem of David’s “righteousness” are all ably treated. For an advanced reader, this is rich material.

For a first‑year college student, though, there are several problems:

- **Too much jargon, not enough hand‑holding.** Terms like “Hiphil,” “hapax legomenon,” “lectio difficilior,” “Chaoskampf,” “deuteronomistic,” “royal ideology,” appear without simple definitions. The tone often sounds like a journal article, not a class.
- **Overly detailed philology and phonetics.** Long scansion/phonetic sections and micro‑meter analysis are fascinating for specialists but will swamp a beginning student. We need fewer stress‑pattern commentaries, more “here’s why this image is cool/important.”
- **Missed chances for concrete demonstration.** The draft sometimes alludes to patterns (“this phrase recurs in Proverbs…”, “this is like Exodus 15…”) without actually quoting those verses in Hebrew + English where they would really help a student see the connection.
- **Verse commentary density.** Some verses get heavy, repetitive treatment (vv. 8–16), while later verses (vv. 38ff) are less fully integrated into the big picture. For a long psalm, grouping verses into thematic units will help.
- **Liturgical section is solid but can be clearer.** It focuses mainly on *migdol/magdil* in *Birkat HaMazon* and *Ein Keloheinu*, but could more clearly organize where different verses/phrases show up and why that matters.

Revisions needed: simplify the theoretical language; define every technical term at first use; cut back on phonetics except where sound really matters; show more Hebrew+English examples from other texts; tie each section back to a few big, memorable ideas (double narrative, storm‑theophany, “God saves because I kept faith,” David → Messiah). The tone should feel more like an excited but clear professor over coffee than like a compressed monograph.
