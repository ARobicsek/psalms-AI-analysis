# Editorial Assessment (College Edition) - Psalm 18

The original introduction and commentary are rich and learned, but they read like a journal article for specialists, not a guide for first‑year students.

Main accessibility problems:

- **Density and pacing.** The introduction drops complex theses immediately (e.g., “theological charter for Davidic kingship,” “re‑mythologization”) without first giving a simple, big‑picture sense of what happens in the psalm.
- **Heavy jargon.** Terms like “Chaoskampf,” “orthographic analysis,” “lectio difficilior,” “royal ideology,” and “Deuteronomistic History” appear with little or no explanation. A first‑year can handle these ideas—but only if they’re unpacked in plain language.
- **Assumed background.** The text casually references Baal, Ugaritic titles, Cross and Freedman, midrashic and medieval debates, without briefly reminding students who/what those are or why they matter.
- **Missed “so what?” moments.** Some genuinely fascinating points (e.g., *magdîl/migdôl* in Birkat HaMazon, Baal vs. YHWH imagery, enemies crying to YHWH but being ignored) are stated more than they are taught. The connections are there, but they’re not always walked through in a way that lets students say, “Oh—that’s why this is cool.”
- **Verse commentary style.** The existing notes are excellent reference material but often read as compressed glosses: many cross‑references, little narrative or explanation of how the poetry is working.

What students need instead: clear orientation (“what’s going on in this psalm?”), defined terms the first time they appear, concrete analogies, and explicit guidance on why any given philological or theological detail is worth their attention.
