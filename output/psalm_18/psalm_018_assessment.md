# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 18

The existing introduction and commentary already contain substantial strengths. They grasp the central structural insight—that Psalm 18 tells the story of deliverance twice, first as cosmic theophany, then as empowered warfare—and they situate the psalm intelligently against Ancient Near Eastern storm‑god imagery and within the Davidic royal ideology. The treatment of orthographic differences between Psalm 18 and 2 Samuel 22, and the liturgical “Migdol/Magdil” variant, are well observed. Many verses are read with sensitivity to parallelism and with awareness of medieval Jewish commentators.

There are, however, notable weaknesses. First, the draft is uneven: early verses receive close attention while vv. 38–51 are barely or not at all treated. Second, the prose can be over‑technical and over‑dense, with heavy grammatical jargon and rather minute stress/phonetic analysis that will fatigue non‑specialists. Third, several fascinating problems raised in the research—Belial in vv. 5–6, the strange verb דָּאָה in v. 11, the shocking “with the crooked You show Yourself twisted” (v. 27), the theologically bold עֲנְוָתְךָ תַרְבֵּנִי in v. 36—are mentioned but not really resolved. The figurative‑language parallels gathered in the research bundle are sometimes cited, but too rarely quoted in Hebrew and English to let readers see the patterns for themselves. Liturgical use is handled in a separate appendix rather than woven into the reading and could be more concrete: when we are told a verse is used in Ein Keloheinu or Birkat HaMazon, we should see the actual prayer Hebrew.

The revised version needs to (1) streamline technical language, (2) quote biblical and liturgical parallels more fully, (3) complete coverage of the latter third of the psalm (especially the international and dynastic ending), and (4) answer some of the Macro/Micro questions that can be settled from the bundle—e.g. what “mighty waters” usually signify, how “cords of death” function elsewhere, how traditional commentators understood God’s “humility” in v. 36, and how Jewish exegesis reads the messianic closure in v. 51. Poetic devices (especially well‑marked inclusio and merism, and the Baal‑polemic in the theophany) deserve clearer, less technical exposition.
