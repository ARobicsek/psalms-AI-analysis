# Commentary on Psalm 18
---
## Introduction
Psalm 18 is one of the rare places in the Hebrew Bible where we can watch a poem travel. It appears twice, once here in the Psalter and once, almost verbatim, in 2 Samuel 22. In Samuel it is lodged in narrative: David, near the end of his career, sings “on the day YHWH saved him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul” (בְּיוֹם הִצִּיל־ה׳ אֹתוֹ מִכַּף כׇּל־אֹיְבָיו וּמִיַּד שָׁאוּל, 18:1). In Psalms, by contrast, it is framed “for the leader” (לַמְנַצֵּחַ), as liturgy.
Comparing the two versions shows what happens when a fiercely personal victory song is taken up into public worship. The Samuel text preserves older, more “defective” spelling and some rougher turns of phrase; the psalm smooths these into later orthography, adds an opening line of devotion—“I love You, YHWH, my strength” (אֶרְחָמְךָ ה׳ חִזְקִי, 18:2), absent from 2 Samuel—and slightly reworks some phrases in the direction of congregational praise. At the end, a single letter changes the sense of the closing doxology. Samuel reads מִגְדּוֹל יְשׁוּעוֹת מַלְכּוֹ, “a tower of victories to His king,” while Psalm 18 reads מַגְדִּיל יְשׁוּעוֹת מַלְכּוֹ, “He magnifies victories for His king” (18:51). The image of a fortress‑tower becomes a verb of ongoing magnification. Jewish liturgy preserved both: *Migdol* is recited in Birkat HaMazon on Shabbat and festivals, *Magdil* on weekdays.
The poem itself is architecturally intricate. It moves in a great arc: from suffocating crisis, through an earth‑shaking appearance of God, to the king’s renewed strength, wide dominion, and the promise of an eternal dynasty.
The first movement (vv. 4–7) plunges us into danger. Death is not an abstraction but a hunter: “Cords of Death encompassed me… torrents of Belial terrified me; cords of Sheol encircled me, snares of Death confronted me” (אֲפָפוּנִי חֶבְלֵי־מָוֶת… נַחֲלֵי בְלִיַּעַל… חֶבְלֵי שְׁאוֹל… מוֹקְשֵׁי מָוֶת). The idiom “cords of death” recurs in Psalm 116:3—“אֲפָפוּנִי חֶבְלֵי־מָוֶת וּמְצָרֵי שְׁאוֹל מְצָאוּנִי, צָרָה וְיָגוֹן אֶמְצָא, the cords of death encompassed me, the torments of Sheol found me”—a stock way of talking about a crisis that feels like drowning and capture at once. “Belial” (בְלִיַּעַל), elsewhere simply “worthlessness” or a “base fellow,” here joins Death and Sheol in a little pantheon of threats. Medievals knew the philology (בְּלִי + יַעַל: “without worth”), but in this poetic register it is more like a personification of sheer ruin—the black flood that sweeps everything away.
The turn comes in verse 7: “In my distress I called on YHWH… from His temple He heard my voice” (בַּצַּר־לִי אֶקְרָא ה׳… מֵהֵיכָלוֹ). “Temple” (הֵיכָל) can mean the earthly sanctuary or the heavenly palace. For David—long before Solomon’s building—Radak takes it as heaven itself: YHWH’s court. In later liturgical use, when this psalm is recited in the context of the actual Temple or synagogue, the ambiguity is fruitful: prayer rises to the unseen Temple above even as it sounds beneath carved stone.
Then the poem erupts. Verses 8–16 are a classical “theophany,” a description of God’s appearing. The earth buckles: “The earth shook and quaked; the foundations of the mountains trembled… because He was angry” (וַתִּגְעַשׁ וַתִּרְעַשׁ הָאָרֶץ; וּמוֹסְדֵי הָרִים יִרְגָּזוּ… כִּי־חָרָה לוֹ). Smoke pours from God’s nostrils, fire from His mouth (v. 9). He “bends the heavens and comes down” (וַיֵּט שָׁמַיִם וַיֵּרַד, v. 10), rides a cherub, and “flies, gliding on the wings of the wind” (וַיִּרְכַּב עַל־כְּרוּב וַיָּעֹף, וַיֵּדֶא עַל־כַּנְפֵי־רוּחַ, v. 11).
This is not private mysticism. It is also polemic. At Ugarit, the god Baal is called “Rider on the Clouds” and is pictured hurling thunderbolts against the Sea god. Psalm 18 borrows that visual vocabulary—storm clouds, thunder, lightning—but wrests it away from Baal. YHWH, not any Canaanite storm‑god, rides the cherub‑chariot. The forces He subdues are no longer personified deities like “Sea” and “Death” but very real armies and political chaos. The poet has demythologized the myth.
Yet even here there is paradox. “He made darkness His hiding place; around Him, His pavilion, darkness of waters, thick clouds of skies” (יָשֶׁת־חֹשֶׁךְ סִתְרוֹ; סְבִיבוֹתָיו סֻכָּתוֹ; חֶשְׁכַת־מַיִם עָבֵי שְׁחָקִים, v. 12). At the moment of revelation God wraps Himself in obscurity. The Talmud (Ḥagigah 12a), playing with this verse, imagines “darkness and cloud and thick gloom surrounding Him,” then asks: is there really darkness before the One for whom “night shines like day” (Ps 139:12)? It answers by distinguishing God’s “inner” and “outer” chambers—a way of saying that even when human beings perceive darkness, God is not dimmed. Medieval Jewish commentators like Radak take the darkness here as a metaphor for God’s hiddenness from the wicked, His help withdrawn from them even as He intervenes to rescue the king.
After the storm comes the rescue in human scale. God “reaches down from on high” (יִשְׁלַח מִמָּרוֹם) and draws David “out of mighty waters” (יַמְשֵׁנִי מִמַּיִם רַבִּים, v. 17). The verb מָשָׁה appears, strikingly, in only one other story: Pharaoh’s daughter naming the infant Moses, “כִּי מִן־הַמַּיִם מְשִׁיתִהוּ, for I drew him out of the water” (Exod 2:10). David here undergoes a sort of second, royal Exodus; like Moses he is a man plucked from perilous waters to become a leader of Israel. Rabbinic imagination links such verses: when the Torah Temimah notes “וַיֵּרָאוּ אֲפִיקֵי מַיִם… מִנִּשְׁמַת רוּחַ אַפֶּךָ” (“the channels of water were seen… from the blast of the breath of Your nostrils,” v. 16) it immediately thinks of the Red Sea: God’s “blast” that split the waters for the people.
The hinge of the psalm is the notoriously bold section on righteousness (vv. 21–25). “YHWH rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands He repaid me” (יִגְמְלֵנִי ה׳ כְּצִדְקִי; כְּבֹר יָדַי יָשִׁיב לִי). Given that the historical David commits adultery and orchestrates a killing, how can he talk this way? The traditional answer is two‑fold. First, Rashi and Radak narrow the frame: here David speaks primarily of his conduct toward Saul, “the LORD’s anointed.” He repeatedly had Saul in his power and refused to kill him. In that limited but crucial sense, his “hands” are clean. Second, the language is covenantal rather than perfectionist. “I have kept the ways of YHWH… all His judgments were before me, and His statutes I did not turn away from me” (18:22–23). This is the Deuteronomic idiom of loyalty; it does not mean sinlessness, but fidelity to the terms of the relationship. When verse 25 repeats the claim and adds “before His eyes” (לְנֶגֶד עֵינָיו), it underscores that this is God’s appraisal, not David’s self‑flattery.
Immediately after, the poem briefly becomes a miniature wisdom text: “With the loyal You act loyally; with the blameless man, blamelessly; with the pure You show Yourself pure, but with the crooked You show Yourself twisted” (עִם־חָסִיד תִּתְחַסָּד… וְעִם־עִקֵּשׁ תִּתְפַּתָּל, vv. 26–27). The Hebrew verb תִּתְפַּתָּל, “You twist Yourself,” is deliberately startling. Ibn Ezra and Radak hasten to say this means that God meets the crooked on their own terms: He out‑maneuvers them, “wrestles” them to the ground, as in Rachel’s pun on נִפְתַּלְתִּי (“I have wrestled,” Gen 30:8). It is a compact statement of moral reciprocity: God is experienced as merciful by the merciful, and as a wily opponent by the devious.
From there the poem shifts voice. In the first half, almost every important verb had God as subject. In the second, the empowered king steps onto the stage: “With You I rush a troop; with my God I scale a wall” (כִּי־בְךָ אָרֻץ גְּדוּד; וּבֵאלֹקַי אֲדַלֶּג־שׁוּר, v. 30). God “girds me with strength… makes my feet like deer’s… trains my hands for battle, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze” (vv. 33–35). The ANE royal inscriptions brag in similar terms—pharaohs who alone can string the great bow—but here the pride is derailed: every boast is grammatically tethered to a prior divine “You.”
In that light, one of the most theologically rich lines is also one of the strangest: “Your humility makes me great” (וְעַנְוַתְךָ תַרְבֵּנִי, v. 36). The noun עֲנָוָה usually means human humility. Applied to God it cannot mean “modesty” in a human sense. Classical Jewish commentators take it as God’s condescension—His willingness to “lower” Himself, to pay attention to an insignificant human life. Radak paraphrases: God, in His humility, “diminishes” His own exaltedness, as it were, to look after David; that is what “magnifies” the king. Malbim adds a psychological nuance: God’s “humility” is His readiness to work through the small and weak, to empower the one who does not trust his own might. For a modern reader used to more abstract talk of “grace,” this earthy phrase is worth savoring: the God whose nostrils breathe fire also stoops.
The final stretch widens the horizon from David’s survival to his international stature. “You have rescued me from the strife of peoples; You have set me as head of nations; a people I did not know serve me” (תְּפַלְּטֵנִי מֵרִיבֵי עָם; תְּשִׂימֵנִי לְרֹאשׁ גּוֹיִם; עַם לֹא־יָדַעְתִּי יַעַבְדֻנִי, v. 44). Foreigners “cringe” (יְכַחֲשׁוּ־לִי), their courage “withers” (יִבֹּלוּ), they “come trembling out of their strongholds” (יִחְרְגוּ מִמִּסְגְּרוֹתֵיהֶם, vv. 45–46). Some of this can be read in terms of David’s actual empire over Moab, Aram, and Edom (2 Sam 8), but the language spills over into aspiration. Jewish tradition heard in it a sketch of messianic dominion; Christian readers from early on saw in it a type of the nations turning to Christ.
All of this culminates in a closing vow of praise and a promise: “Therefore I acclaim You among the nations, YHWH, and sing to Your name: He magnifies victories for His king, and does ḥesed—steadfast love—to His anointed, to David and to his seed forever” (עַל־כֵּן אוֹדְךָ בַגּוֹיִם ה׳, וּלְשִׁמְךָ אֲזַמֵּרָה. מַגְדִּיל יְשׁוּעוֹת מַלְכּוֹ; וְעֹשֶׂה חֶסֶד לִמְשִׁיחוֹ, לְדָוִד וּלְזַרְעוֹ עַד־עוֹלָם, vv. 50–51). The word “anointed” (מָשִׁיחַ) here first of all means David himself and the line of kings descended from him. But with the little phrase “to his seed forever,” the poem opens itself to later readings. Medieval Jewish commentators like Radak vigorously insist that זֶרַע is plural—successive kings of the Davidic house, culminating in the Messiah of Israel; Christian exegetes from the Fathers through Calvin read the singular Messiah. Either way, the psalm does more than recount a narrow escape. It presents David’s deliverance as charter story: this is how God deals with His king, and will go on dealing.
For that reason, Psalm 18 has belonged not only to David but to communities ever since: sung after meals, recited with the Torah, placed in the mouth of every worshiper who calls in distress and tastes rescue.
  
## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use
#### Full psalm
The full text of Psalm 18 is not part of the fixed daily synagogue service, but its twin, 2 Samuel 22, is chanted as the haftarah on the Seventh Day of Passover, paired with the Song at the Sea (Exodus 15). In that setting, David’s song of deliverance is heard as a royal echo of Israel’s primal redemption from Egypt. The same chapter in Samuel also appears as the haftarah for Parashat Ha’azinu in some rites, again underscoring the connection between covenant, song, and kingship.
#### Key verses
Several verses have slipped the bounds of the psalm to become pillars of Jewish prayer. Most prominent is 18:51, “מַגְדִּיל יְשׁוּעוֹת מַלְכּוֹ… לְדָוִד וּלְזַרְעוֹ עַד־עוֹלָם, He magnifies victories for His king… to David and his seed forever,” which concludes *Birkat HaMazon*. After a string of petitions beginning הָרַחֲמָן (“May the Merciful One…”), the blessing closes: 
> מַגְדִּיל יְשׁוּעוֹת מַלְכּוֹ, וְעֹשֶׂה חֶסֶד לִמְשִׁיחוֹ, לְדָוִד וּלְזַרְעוֹ עַד עוֹלָם.  
> “He magnifies victories for His king, and does steadfast love to His anointed, to David and his descendants forever.”
On Shabbat and festivals, following the Samuel version, the opening word is *מִגְדּוֹל* (“a tower of victories”). Thus the ordinary act of eating is closed with a quiet reaffirmation of Davidic hope.
Verses 31–32, “הָאֵל תָּמִים דַּרְכּוֹ… כִּי מִי אֱלוֹקַּ מִבַּלְעֲדֵי ה׳ וּמִי צוּר זוּלָתִי אֱלֹקֵינוּ,” are recited in many communities before *Ein Keloheinu*, forming a scriptural ramp up to the hymn’s refrain “אֵין כֵּאלֹקֵינוּ, there is none like our God.” In the Edot HaMizrach Torah service, they are also said while the scroll is carried through the congregation, linked with “תּוֹרָה צִוָּה־לָנוּ מֹשֶׁה”: God’s “refined word” is concretely the Torah they see.
#### Phrases
A number of shorter phrases serve as liturgical building blocks. “מְהֻלָּל אֶקְרָא ה׳, Worthy of praise I call on YHWH” (18:4) appears in some Sephardic communities in *Hakafot* for Simḥat Torah, embedded in a piyyut that circles the bimah with the scrolls. 
The interrogative of 18:32, “כִּי מִי אֱלוֹקַּ מִבַּלְעֲדֵי ה׳ וּמִי צוּר זוּלָתִי אֱלֹקֵינוּ,” is quoted directly in the prelude to *Ein Keloheinu*:  
> כִּי מִי אֱלוֹקַּ מִבַּלְעֲדֵי ה׳, וּמִי צוּר זוּלָתִי אֱלֹקֵינוּ.  
> “For who is God except YHWH, and who is a Rock but our God?”
Here the verse’s original polemic against Baal and every other claimant to divinity is turned into a daily declaration of exclusive loyalty.
Even more compact fragments—“נֵרִי ה׳ אֱלֹקַי יַגִּיהַּ חָשְׁכִּי, YHWH my God lights up my darkness” (18:29); “חַי־ה׳ וּבָרוּךְ צוּרִי, YHWH lives; blessed is my rock” (18:47)—are woven into Yom Kippur and Shabbat poems, where David’s personal experience of guidance and stability becomes the congregation’s plea for light and firm ground in seasons of judgment.

## Verse-by-Verse Commentary
Because of the psalm’s length and the tight interconnection of its lines, it is most helpful to read it in small stanzas rather than atomized verses. Each group below begins with the Hebrew text (broken at natural poetic pauses), followed by commentary.

**Verses 1–3**
לַמְנַצֵּחַ לְעֶבֶד ה׳ לְדָוִד;  
אֲשֶׁר דִּבֶּר לַה׳ אֶת־דִּבְרֵי הַשִּׁירָה הַזֹּאת,  
בְּיוֹם הִצִּיל־ה׳ אֹתוֹ מִכַּף כׇּל־אֹיְבָיו וּמִיַּד שָׁאוּל.  
וַיֹּאמַר: אֶרְחָמְךָ ה׳ חִזְקִי.  
ה׳ סַ֥לְעִי וּמְצוּדָתִי וּמְפַלְטִי;  
אֵלִי צוּרִי אֶחֱסֶה־בּוֹ, מָגִנִּי וְקֶרֶן־יִשְׁעִי, מִשְׂגַּבִּי.
The superscription is unusually full. David is “עֶבֶד ה׳, the servant of YHWH,” a title otherwise rare in the Psalms. Radak glosses: one “who sets all his strength and intent on the Blessed God.” It is a paradoxical royal title: David is king over Israel precisely as he is servant under God. The historical note—“on the day YHWH saved him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul”—distinguishes Saul from “all enemies.” Rashi asks why; he answers that Saul was “the harshest to him and pursued him more than all of them,” and, as Midrash Tehillim adds, he was not a foreign tyrant but “the anointed of YHWH.” David’s survival required not only courage but restraint: he refused to kill the king who was hunting him.
Verse 2 opens abruptly, and tenderly: “אֶרְחָמְךָ ה׳ חִזְקִי, I love You, YHWH, my strength.” The verb רִחַם in the simple stem (qal) with a human subject addressing God is unique in the Bible. Usually it appears in the intensive stem and points downward—God “has compassion” (מְרַחֵם) on humans, or a parent on a child. Here David dares to say to God, in a verb related to רֶחֶם, “womb”: “I cherish You with gut‑love.” Ibn Ezra, cautious, notes that the form is unusual but defends it as legitimate; Rashi simply takes it as “I love you,” pointing to the Aramaic Targum’s וְרַחֵים.
Verse 3 unleashes an epithet cascade: “YHWH my crag (סַלעִי), my fortress (מְצוּדָתִי), and my deliverer (מְפַלְטִי); my God, my rock (צוּרִי), in whom I take refuge; my shield (מָגִנִּי), the horn of my salvation (קֶרֶן יִשְׁעִי), my high tower (מִשְׂגַּבִּי).” These metaphors are drawn from three overlapping worlds.
Geology: סֶלַע and צוּר both mean “rock,” but with nuance. Malbim suggests that צוּר is the massive rock itself, while סֶלַע hints at clefts and ledges where one can hide. Either way, the language is rooted in David’s years among the cliffs of the Judean wilderness (e.g., En Gedi), where literal rock faces and caves sheltered him.
Fortification: “fortress” (מְצוּדָה) and “high tower” (מִשְׂגָּב) are terms for built defenses, citadels and towers. Later in the psalm “high places” (בָּמוֹתַי) denote tactical elevated ground.
Weapons: “shield” (מָגֵן) and “horn” (קֶרֶן) introduce martial symbolism. In Deuteronomy 33:17, Joseph’s power is “the horns of the wild ox” with which he gores nations; here the “horn of my salvation” imagines God as the source of irresistible thrust.
The piling up is deliberate. Rather than choosing one image and developing it, the poet stacks them until the effect is almost architectural. For a worshiper who knows the liturgy of *Ein Keloheinu*, verse 32 later echoes this opening directly: “כִּי מִי אֱלוֹקַּ מִבַּלְעֲדֵי ה׳, וּמִי צוּר זוּלָתִי אֱלֹקֵינוּ—For who is God except YHWH, and who is a Rock but our God?”

**Verses 4–7**
מְהֻלָּל אֶקְרָא ה׳; וּמִן־אֹיְבַי אִוָּשֵׁעַ.  
אֲפָפוּנִי חֶבְלֵי־מָוֶת; וְנַחֲלֵי בְלִיַּעַל יְבַעֲתוּנִי.  
חֶבְלֵי שְׁאוֹל סְבָבוּנִי; קִדְמוּנִי מוֹקְשֵׁי מָוֶת.  
בַּצַּר־לִי אֶקְרָא ה׳, וְאֶל־אֱלֹקַי אֲשַׁוֵּעַ;  
יִשְׁמַע מֵהֵיכָלוֹ קוֹלִי, וְשַׁוְעָתִי לְפָנָיו תָּבוֹא בְאׇזְנָיו.
Verse 4 states the program in miniature: “I call on YHWH—who is worthy of praise—and from my enemies I am saved.” The participle מְהֻלָּל (“praised / praiseworthy”) grammatically clings to the divine Name: YHWH is the One who by nature deserves praise. Rashi notes a subtlety: David praises even before the deliverance, because he trusts the outcome.
Verses 5–6 plunge us into threat. “חֶבְלֵי־מָוֶת, the cords of death,” have wrapped him; “נַחֲלֵי בְלִיַּעַל, the torrents of Belial,” sweep over him; “מוֹקְשֵׁי מָוֶת, snares of death,” lie ahead. The figurative language is thick. “Cords” (חֶבֶל) can be ropes used to bind a victim, but the same noun, vocalized differently, can mean birth pangs. Hosea 13:13 speaks of “חֶבְלֵי יוֹלֵדָה, the pangs of a woman in labor.” Rashi, noting this, lets both images hover: David is at once bound like a prisoner and wracked like a woman in childbirth.
“Belial” is one of the psalm’s cruxes. Elsewhere we meet “sons of Belial” (בְּנֵי בְלִיַּעַל) as scoundrels; BDB glosses the noun as “worthlessness.” Yet here “torrents of Belial” run parallel to “cords of death” and “cords of Sheol,” giving it a more shadowy force. The parallel in 2 Samuel 22:5 speaks of “מִשְׁבְּרֵי מָוֶת, breakers of death” in place of “חֶבְלֵי־מָוֶת,” suggesting that “Belial” names destructive chaos, the dark flood that pours in when structures collapse.
This cluster of images appears again in Psalm 116:3: “אֲפָפוּנִי חֶבְלֵי־מָוֶת וּמְצָרֵי שְׁאוֹל מְצָאוּנִי, צָרָה וְיָגוֹן אֶמְצָא—The cords of death encompassed me; the straits of Sheol found me; trouble and sorrow I find.” Proverbs transfers the snare metaphor to moral warning: “מוֹקְשֵׁי מָוֶת, snares of death,” threaten those who despise discipline (Prov 13:14; 14:27). In Psalm 18 the powers are external: not David’s own sin but hostile forces have cast their nets.
Verse 7 is the pivot: “בַּצַּר־לִי אֶקְרָא ה׳… יִשְׁמַע מֵהֵיכָלוֹ קוֹלִי.” Two verbs for crying out are piled—קרא (“call”) and שָׁוַע (“cry for help”)—to underline the intensity. God is pictured in His הֵיכָל, palace or temple; David’s voice travels “before Him” and “into His ears.” The line’s simplicity masks a theology of prayer: distress is not only felt; it is vocalized, and that cry crosses the immense distance between earth and the divine residence. Later mystic and liturgical traditions will map that path in ever finer detail; here it is enough to say: God hears.

**Verses 8–11**
וַתִּגְעַשׁ וַתִּרְעַשׁ הָאָרֶץ;  
וּמוֹסְדֵי הָרִים יִרְגָּזוּ, וַיִּתְגָּעֲשׁוּ כִּי־חָרָה לוֹ.  
עָלָה עָשָׁן בְּאַפּוֹ, וְאֵשׁ מִפִּיו תֹּאכֵל;  
גֶּחָלִים בָּעֲרוּ מִמֶּנּוּ.  
וַיֵּט שָׁמַיִם וַיֵּרַד; וַעֲרָפֶל תַּחַת רַגְלָיו.  
וַיִּרְכַּב עַל־כְּרוּב וַיָּעֹף; וַיֵּדֶא עַל־כַּנְפֵי־רוּחַ.
The verbs in v. 8 (“וַתִּגְעַשׁ… וַתִּרְעַשׁ… יִרְגָּזוּ… וַיִּתְגָּעֲשׁוּ”) pile synonym upon synonym for shaking. The poet chooses the most immobile things in his world—earth and the foundations of mountains—to dramatize how far God’s anger reaches. As Ibn Ezra remarks, these are metaphors for David’s enemies, however solid they seem. The line “כִּי־חָרָה לוֹ, because it burned to Him” uses the standard idiom for wrath: a “hot nose” (אַף), which leads directly into the image of v. 9.
“עָלָה עָשָׁן בְּאַפּוֹ, smoke went up from His nostrils.” The word אַף means both “nose” and “anger.” Rashi, with characteristic common sense, comments that when people are enraged, their breathing heats, and breath may be seen like smoke in cold air. Yet the next colon, “וְאֵשׁ מִפִּיו תֹּאכֵל; גֶחָלִים בָּעֲרוּ מִמֶּנּוּ, fire from His mouth devours; coals blaze from Him,” edges into mythic territory: God’s body as volcanic vent.
Verses 10–11 move from earth to sky. God “bends” (נָטָה) the heavens—conceived as a solid vault—and “comes down.” The verb is blunt: there is no hesitation about attributing vertical motion to God. Medieval rationalists remind us this is “the language of humans,” not a literal spatial descent, but the poetry insists on the image. He stands on עֲרָפֶל, thick cloud or deep gloom, as on pavement.
The mode of transport is both familiar and strange: “He rode on a cherub and flew” (וַיִּרְכַּב עַל־כְּרוּב וַיָּעֹף). Elsewhere, cherubim flank the ark and serve as the base of God’s invisible throne; Ezekiel sees them bearing a chariot of fiery wheels. Psalm 104:3 uses similar language of clouds: “הַשָּׂם־עָבִים רְכוּבוֹ, who makes the clouds His chariot; הַמְהַלֵּךְ עַל־כַּנְפֵי־רוּחַ, who walks on the wings of the wind.” Our psalm fuses these: the cherub is steed, the wind’s wings are the air‑currents carrying Him.
The rare verb וַיֵּדֶא (from דאה) probably means “to glide, to swoop,” used elsewhere of an eagle (Deut 28:49). It adds a touch of avian grace to the image: God does not lurch but soars. The point is less to define God’s anatomy than to answer a question posed in v. 7: how does a cry from the depths reach heaven, and how does help travel back? The answer is a symbolic picture: heaven itself bends, and the Divine Rider hurtles into the fray.

**Verses 12–15**
יָשֶׁת־חֹשֶׁךְ סִתְרוֹ; סְבִיבוֹתָיו סֻכָּתוֹ;  
חֶשְׁכַת־מַיִם, עָבֵי שְׁחָקִים.  
מִנֹּגַהּ נֶגְדּוֹ, עָבָיו עָבְרוּ;  
בָּרָד וְגַחֲלֵי־אֵשׁ.  
וַיַּרְעֵם בַּשָּׁמַיִם ה׳; וְעֶלְיוֹן יִתֵּן קֹלוֹ;  
בָּרָד וְגַחֲלֵי־אֵשׁ.  
וַיִּשְׁלַח חִצָּיו וַיְפִיצֵם;  
וּבְרָקִים רָב וַיְהֻמֵּם.
God’s pavilion is made of darkness. “יָשֶׁת־חֹשֶׁךְ סִתְרוֹ… חֶשְׁכַת־מַיִם עָבֵי שְׁחָקִים—He makes darkness His hiding place; darkness of waters, thick clouds of skies.” The word סֻכָּה (“sukkah”) normally names a booth or battle‑tent. Here, as Meiri notes, it is God’s own “encampment” in the storm. The Torah Temimah cites rabbinic homilies on this verse to distinguish God’s “inner chambers,” suffused with light, from the outer “mists” visible to human eyes; the darkness is not a deficiency in God but a limitation of human perception.
Verse 13 introduces a sudden “נֹגַהּ, brightness” before Him, and from that glowing front His “clouds” (עָבָיו) pass, discharging “hail and coals of fire.” The repetition of “hail and coals of fire” in verses 13 and 14 has led some textual critics to suspect a scribal doublet, but the Masoretic Text preserves it, and the effect is incantatory, like the repeated hammer blows of a storm.
Thunder is explicitly called “the voice” of YHWH: “וַיַּרְעֵם בַּשָּׁמַיִם ה׳, the LORD thundered in the heavens; וְעֶלְיוֹן יִתֵּן קֹלוֹ, the Most High gave forth His voice.” Psalm 29 develops this extensively, repeating “קוֹל ה׳” seven times over crashing seas and cedars. Here the thunder belongs to the same polemic against Baal: what Canaanites ascribed to their storm‑god, Israel hears as the speech of YHWH.
Verse 15 returns to weaponry imagery. “He sent His arrows and scattered them; He shot lightning and routed them.” Lightning as divine arrows is a shared metaphor across cultures. The Babylonian Marduk and the Greek Zeus throw bolt‑weapons; here YHWH’s arrows are not natural forces but expressions of His will in history—the scattering and panic of enemies that had seemed overwhelming.

**Verses 16–20**
וַיֵּרָאוּ אֲפִיקֵי מַיִם;  
וַיִּגָּלוּ מוֹסְדוֹת תֵּבֵל;  
מִגַּעֲרָתְךָ ה׳, מִנִּשְׁמַת רוּחַ אַפֶּךָ.  
יִשְׁלַח מִמָּרוֹם יִקָּחֵנִי;  
יַמְשֵׁנִי מִמַּיִם רַבִּים.  
יַצִּילֵנִי מֵאֹיְבִי עָז;  
וּמִשֹּׂנְאַי כִּי־אָמְצוּ מִמֶּנִּי.  
יְקַדְּמוּנִי בְיוֹם־אֵידִי;  
וַיְהִי־ה׳ לְמִשְׁעָן לִי.  
וַיּוֹצִיאֵנִי לַמֶּרְחָב;  
יְחַלְּצֵנִי כִּי חָפֵץ־בִּי.
The storm now affects creation’s architecture: “וַיֵּרָאוּ אֲפִיקֵי מַיִם, the channels of water were seen; וַיִּגָּלוּ מוֹסְדוֹת תֵּבֵל, the foundations of the world were laid bare.” As at the Red Sea, the bed of the waters is exposed. Psalm 77:17–19 speaks similarly of the Exodus: “the waters saw You… the clouds poured water… Your way was through the sea.” Here, as Rashi notes, the imagery fuses creation and redemption: the God who once “rebuked” (גָּעַר) the primordial waters (cf. Ps 104:7) now rebukes them again to save His anointed.
Verse 17 shifts from cosmic to personal scale with the tender verb מָשָׁה, “to draw out.” God “sends from on high” and “takes me,” “draws me out of mighty waters.” As noted above, this echoes Moses’ own naming (Exod 2:10). We are meant to hear David’s story as a new chapter in the pattern of God bringing someone up from drowning into leadership.
Verses 18–19 spell out the human threat: “a strong enemy… they confronted me on the day of my disaster.” Rashi and Radak variously see Saul, Absalom, the Philistines in these lines. David acknowledges their superiority—“they were too strong for me” (אָמְצוּ מִמֶּנִּי)—which sets up the contrast in the next clause: “וַיְהִי־ה׳ לְמִשְׁעָן לִי, YHWH was a support / staff for me.” The noun מִשְׁעָן appears in Isaiah 3:1 for the “staff” and “stay” of society; here it is the crutch for a staggering king.
Verse 20 brings the spatial metaphor full circle: from cords and constriction (צַר) to breadth: “וַיּוֹצִיאֵנִי לַמֶּרְחָב, He brought me out into an open place.” Psalm 31:9 uses the same idiom: “הֶעֱמַדְתָּ בַמֶּרְחָב רַגְלָי, You have set my feet in a broad place.” Narrowness, in Hebrew, is distress; space is relief. The reason given is disarmingly simple: “כִּי חָפֵץ־בִּי, because He delighted in me.” We might expect a reference to merit; instead we get delight. Only later (vv. 21–25) will David reflect on his righteousness. The order is telling: grace first, accounting second.

**Verses 21–25**
יִגְמְלֵנִי ה׳ כְּצִדְקִי;  
כְּבֹר יָדַי יָשִׁיב לִי.  
כִּי־שָׁמַרְתִּי דַּרְכֵי ה׳;  
וְלֹא־רָשַׁעְתִּי מֵאֱלֹקָי.  
כִּי כׇל־מִשְׁפָּטָיו לְנֶגְדִּי;  
וְחֻקֹּתָיו לֹא־אָסִיר מֶנִּי.  
וָאֱהִי תָמִים עִמּוֹ;  
וָאֶשְׁתַּמֵּר מֵעֲוֺנִי.  
וַיָּשֶׁב ה׳ לִי כְּצִדְקִי;  
כְּבֹר יָדַי לְנֶגֶד עֵינָיו.
This central stanza is theologically delicate. David twice insists that “YHWH repaid me according to my righteousness” (כְּצִדְקִי) and “the cleanness of my hands” (בֹּר יָדַי). The idiom “clean hands and a pure heart” is familiar from Psalm 24:4; there it names those qualified to ascend YHWH’s hill. Here it is linked with deliverance in battle.
Traditional Jewish commentators avoid triumphalism by reading these lines locally. Rashi and Radak both connect “cleanness of hands” to David’s refusal to harm Saul when he cut off his robe and took his spear (1 Sam 24, 26). Meiri sharpens the point: in all his troubles, David “did not speculate against” God’s attributes or promises. In that sense he was תָּמִים עִמּוֹ, “blameless with Him”—not sinless, but single‑hearted.
Verses 22–23 describe the content of this righteousness in covenant terms: “I kept the ways of YHWH… all His judgments were before me; His statutes I did not turn away from me.” “Judgments” (מִשְׁפָּטִים) and “statutes” (חֻקִּים) are Deuteronomic keywords for the Torah’s demands. Malbim makes a fine distinction: the “judgments” are laws reason can see; the “statutes” are divine decrees whose reasons are hidden. David, he says, obeys both not because they happen to align with his inner sense, but because they are God’s.
Verse 24 adds a psychological note: “וָאֶשְׁתַּמֵּר מֵעֲוֺנִי, I kept myself from my iniquity.” The possessive “my” suggests a particular besetting sin. Commentators speculate: the temptation to vengeance? pride? The text is silent, perhaps to allow any reader to insert his or her own. What matters is the reflexive form: David has exerted vigilance over himself.
Verse 25 repeats v. 21 but adds “לְנֶגֶד עֵינָיו, before His eyes.” What mattered in Israel’s theology was not public reputation but divine perception. Proverbs 5:21 says, “כִּי נֹכַח עֵינֵי ה׳ דַּרְכֵי אִישׁ, for a man’s ways are before the eyes of YHWH.” Here that scrutiny is a comfort: the God who knows the hidden self has seen David’s integrity and acted accordingly.
---
**Verses 26–28**
עִם־חָסִיד תִּתְחַסָּד;  
עִם־גְּבַר תָּמִים תִּתַּמָּם.  
עִם־נָבָר תִּתְבָּרָר;  
וְעִם־עִקֵּשׁ תִּתְפַּתָּל.  
כִּי־אַתָּה עַם־עָנִי תוֹשִׁיעַ;  
וְעֵינַיִם רָמוֹת תַּשְׁפִּיל.
These three verses read like a proverb dropped into a royal psalm. They articulate a general principle of divine reciprocity. Four human types—“loyal” (חָסִיד), “blameless” (תָּמִים), “pure / tested” (נָבָר), “crooked” (עִקֵּשׁ)—meet four matching divine actions in the reflexive stem: God “shows Himself loyal,” “blameless,” “pure,” and, most disturbingly, “twisted” (תִּתְפַּתָּל) toward the crooked.
The rabbinic and medieval tradition is unanimous that God is not literally perverse. Rather, as Rashi puts it, He “deals with them according to their crooked ways.” Ibn Ezra invokes Genesis 30:8, where Rachel names Naphtali from נִפְתַּלְתִּי, “I have wrestled”: the root פתל can mean to twist or to wrestle. God entangles the perverse in stratagems that confound them.
Verse 28 grounds the maxim socially and emotionally: “For You save a lowly people (עַם־עָנִי), but haughty eyes You bring down.” The “lowly” here are those crushed and humbled, either socially or in spirit. Zephaniah 3:12 uses the same phrase, “עַם עָנִי וְדַל, a poor and lowly people,” left in Jerusalem after judgment. In that light, David’s earlier “I was brought into a broad place” is not only personal; it anticipates God’s broader habit of lifting the downtrodden.
---
**Verses 29–31**
כִּי־אַתָּה תָּאִיר נֵרִי;  
ה׳ אֱלֹקַי יַגִּיהַּ חָשְׁכִּי.  
כִּי־בְךָ אָרֻץ גְּדוּד;  
וּבֵאלֹקַי אֲדַלֶּג־שׁוּר.  
הָאֵל תָּמִים דַּרְכּוֹ;  
אִמְרַת־ה׳ צְרוּפָה;  
מָגֵן הוּא לְכֹל הַחֹסִים בּוֹ.
The metaphors of light and movement now link divine character and human action. “You light my lamp” (נֵרִי) is intimate, domestic language: in a windowless house, one’s lamp is one’s life. In 2 Samuel 21:17 David’s men call him “the lamp of Israel,” begging him not to risk it in battle. Here the source of the flame is clearly external: “YHWH my God illumines my darkness” (יַגִּיהַּ חָשְׁכִּי). The darkness is both situational (danger, confusion) and existential. Isaiah 60:2 will say of Zion, “חֹשֶׁךְ יְכַסֶּה אֶרֶץ… וְעָלַיִךְ יִזְרַח ה׳, darkness shall cover the earth… but upon you YHWH will shine.” Our verse anticipates that move from physical to spiritual light.
Verse 30 turns illumination into courage: “With You I rush a troop; with my God I scale a wall.” The noun גְּדוּד can mean a raiding band or a military unit; either way, David pictures himself charging into or perhaps even through a formation that would be suicide without divine backing. “Scale a wall” (אֲדַלֶּג־שׁוּר) is hyperbole for siege success. The Midrash, delighting in concrete detail, links it to David’s conquest of Jerusalem, where Joab scaled the fortress.
Verse 31 underwrites these claims with theology: “הָאֵל תָּמִים דַּרְכּוֹ, As for God, His way is perfect; אִמְרַת־ה׳ צְרוּפָה, the word of YHWH is refined.” The verb צָרַף describes the smelting of metals; Proverbs 30:5 uses the same phrase: “כׇּל־אִמְרַת אֱלוֹקַּ צְרוּפָה, every word of God is refined.” In both cases the image is of promise and command with no slag—no deceit, no defect. The Torah Temimah quotes the Talmud (Yoma 72b) to this effect: to the one who “merits,” the Torah’s words are a life‑giving fire; to the one who does not, they burn—a way of saying the same purity that comforts also judges.
The verse’s second half—“מָגֵן הוּא לְכֹל הַחֹסִים בּוֹ, He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him”—universalizes what has so far been narrated as David’s personal story. This line, recited in some Sephardic communities while the Torah processes through the synagogue on Rosh Hashanah, invites every listener to hear themselves into the poem: the God who lit David’s lamp can light theirs.

**Verses 32–36**
כִּי מִי אֱלוֹקַּ מִבַּלְעֲדֵי ה׳;  
וּמִי צוּר זוּלָתִי אֱלֹקֵינוּ.  
הָאֵל הַמְאַזְּרֵנִי חָיִל;  
וַיִּתֵּן תָּמִים דַּרְכִּי.  
מְשַׁוֶּה רַגְלַי כָּאַיָּלוֹת;  
וְעַל בָּמוֹתַי יַעֲמִידֵנִי.  
מְלַמֵּד יָדַי לַמִּלְחָמָה;  
וְנִחֲתָה קֶשֶׁת־נְחוּשָׁה זְרוֹעֹתָי.  
וַתִּתֶּן־לִי מָגֵן יִשְׁעֶךָ;  
וִימִינְךָ תִּסְעָדֵנִי;  
וְעַנְוַתְךָ תַּרְבֵּנִי.
Verse 32 poses two rhetorical questions: “Who is God except YHWH, and who is a Rock except our God?” The answer is, obviously, “no one.” This formula appears in Deuteronomy 32:31 (“כִּי לֹא כְצוּרֵנוּ צוּרָם, for their rock is not like our Rock”) and is taken up in the *Ein Keloheinu* prelude. It is not yet philosophical monotheism in the later sense, but it is a firm denial that any other claimed power has claim over Israel.
Verses 33–35 return to empowerment. God “girds me with might,” “makes my way perfect,” “makes my feet like hinds’, and sets me on my heights.” The “hind” (אַיָּלָה) is a sure‑footed mountain deer; Habakkuk 3:19 borrows the same phrase: “ה׳ אֱלֹקַי חֵילִי וַיָּשֶׂם רַגְלַי כָּאַיָּלוֹת.” The image is not simply of speed but stability on dangerous slopes—political and spiritual.
The “bow of bronze” (קֶשֶׁת נְחוּשָׁה) of v. 35 has drawn much comment. Bronze is not literally used for bows; it is either a hyperbolic way of saying “extremely stiff bow” or shorthand for a composite bow reinforced with metal. Either way, David claims strength beyond ordinary soldiers. Yet the participle מְלַמֵּד, “teaching,” keeps the agency clear: this prowess is learned from God.
Verse 36 is the theological peak: “וְעַנְוַתְךָ תַּרְבֵּנִי.” As noted above, עֲנָוָה ordinarily names human humility. Applied to God, Radak hears “Your humility and piety”; Metzudat David glosses, “the greatness of the humility in You to look upon me made me as if I were a great people.” Malbim points out that true greatness, human or divine, is shown in stooping to the small. In modern terms, the line says: God’s attention to what is beneath Him is what lifts that thing up. It is a compact description of grace that sits happily beside all the talk of “merit” in the previous stanza.
The Torah Temimah, commenting on the parallel “הַמְאַזְּרֵנִי חָיִל” and “וַתְּאַזְּרֵנִי חַיִל לַמִּלְחָמָה” (v. 40), notes a Talmudic play (Niddah 31a): David says to God, “You girded me and strengthened me”—a way of holding together God’s initiative and David’s responsibility.

**Verses 37–42**
תַּרְחִיב צַעֲדִי תַחְתָּי;  
וְלֹא מָעֲדוּ קַרְסֻלָּי.  
אֶרְדּוֹף אֹיְבַי וְאַשִּׂיגֵם;  
וְלֹא־אָשׁוּב עַד־כַּלּוֹתָם.  
אֶמְחָצֵם וְלֹא־יֻכְלוּ קוּם;  
יִפְּלוּ תַּחַת רַגְלָי.  
וַתְּאַזְּרֵנִי חַיִל לַמִּלְחָמָה;  
תַּכְרִיעַ קָמַי תַּחְתָּי.  
וְאֹיְבַי נָתַתָּה לִי עֹרֶף;  
וּמְשַׂנְאַי אַצְמִיתֵם.  
יְשַׁוְּעוּ וְאֵין מוֹשִׁיעַ;  
עַל־ה׳ וְלֹא עָנָם.
Here the “I” of the king is subject of a machine‑gun run of verbs: “I pursue… overtake… strike… they fall beneath my feet.” The expansion of step in v. 37—“תַּרְחִיב צַעֲדִי תַחְתָּי”—evokes freedom of movement on the battlefield. Narrow footing means stumbling; broad steps mean stability. Proverbs 4:12 uses the same metaphor spiritually: “בְּלֶכְתְּךָ לֹא יֵצַר צַעֲדֶךָ, when you walk, your stride will not be hampered.”
The imagery of v. 39, “they fall beneath my feet,” belongs to the common ANE iconography of conquest: victorious kings are depicted with their feet on the necks of their foes. Psalm 110:1 famously takes this up: “עַד־אָשִׁית אֹיְבֶיךָ הֲדֹם לְרַגְלֶיךָ, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”
In verse 41 the enemies try a last resort: “יְשַׁוְּעוּ וְאֵין מוֹשִׁיעַ; עַל־ה׳ וְלֹא עָנָם, They cry for help, but there is no savior; to YHWH, but He does not answer them.” This is troubling to modern ears. Are these Israelites, calling on the same God? Or foreign soldiers invoking the God of their victor because their own gods have failed? Radak suggests their prayer lacks sincerity: they “call to YHWH, but their heart is not right with Him.” Either way, the verse bluntly affirms divine partiality: in this conflict, God has taken sides. Other biblical texts will insist that God hears “the cry of the poor” even when they are not Israelite (e.g., Jonah 3); here the focus is on God’s fidelity to His covenant king.
For ancient hearers, the violence of these verses would have sounded like standard victory rhetoric. Today they demand moral wrestling. One fruitful approach is to read them alongside David’s earlier refusal to kill Saul and his later grief over enemies’ deaths (e.g. 2 Sam 1). The same David who can, in prayer, say “I ground them like dust” is also capable of lamenting his fallen foes. The psalm gives us one register—the experience of triumph from inside the king’s story—not a complete ethic of warfare.

**Verses 43–46**
וְאֶשְׁחָקֵם כְּעָפָר עַל־פְּנֵי־רוּחַ;  
כְּטִיט חוּצוֹת אֲרִיקֵם.  
תְּפַלְּטֵנִי מֵרִיבֵי־עָם;  
תְּשִׂימֵנִי לְרֹאשׁ גּוֹיִם;  
עַם לֹא־יָדַעְתִּי יַעַבְדֻנִי.  
לְשֵׁמַע־אֹזֶן יִשָּׁמְעוּ לִי;  
בְּנֵי־נֵכָר יְכַחֲשׁוּ־לִי.  
בְּנֵי־נֵכָר יִבֹּלוּ;  
וְיַחְרְגוּ מִמִּסְגְּרוֹתֵיהֶם.
The metaphors of v. 43—“I ground them like dust before the wind; like street‑mud I empty them out”—intensify the previous stanza’s images of defeat. “Dust before the wind” appears in Psalm 1:4 of the wicked; here it is the enemies blown away. “Street‑mud” evokes the filth trampled outside city gates. The verb אֲרִיקֵם (“I empty them”) can also mean “pour out,” as in emptying a vessel. The enemies have become refuse.
Verses 44–45 shift attention from Israel’s internal enemies to foreign peoples. “מֵרִיבֵי־עָם” can mean “from the strife of my people” (as in the Samuel version, מריבי עמי, referring to Saul’s faction) or more generally “from the quarrels of peoples.” In either case, the outcome is elevation: “You set me as head of nations” (לְרֹאשׁ גּוֹיִם). This is not just survival but rule.
“A people I did not know serve me; at the hearing of the ear they obey me” (לְשֵׁמַע־אֹזֶן יִשָּׁמְעוּ לִי). The phrase “hearing of the ear” suggests that mere report of David’s victories brings submission. “בְּנֵי־נֵכָר, sons of the foreigner,” “כִּחֲשׁוּ־לִי, cringe / dissemble to me,” either lying about former allegiances (Ibn Ezra) or feigning deeper loyalty than they feel out of fear (Rashi).
Verse 46 uses two vivid verbs: “יִבֹּלוּ, they wither” and “יַחְרְגוּ, they come limping / trembling” from their fortresses (מִמִּסְגְּרוֹתֵיהֶם). The second root appears only here and in Micah 7:17, where enemies “crawl out of their holes trembling like serpents.” The picture is of psychological collapse. Political realities may have been more complicated, but the psalm distills them: foreign powers lose nerve; the anointed king stands.

**Verses 47–51**
חַי־ה׳ וּבָרוּךְ צוּרִי;  
וְיָרוּם אֱלוֹקֵי יִשְׁעִי.  
הָאֵל הַנּוֹתֵן נְקָמוֹת לִי;  
וַיַּדְבֵּר עַמִּים תַּחְתָּי.  
מְפַלְּטִי מֵאֹיְבָי;  
אַף מִן־קָמַי תְּרוֹמְמֵנִי;  
מֵאִישׁ חָמָס תַּצִּילֵנִי.  
עַל־כֵּן אוֹדְךָ בַגּוֹיִם ה׳;  
וּלְשִׁמְךָ אֲזַמֵּרָה.  
מַגְדִּיל יְשׁוּעוֹת מַלְכּוֹ;  
וְעֹשֶׂה חֶסֶד לִמְשִׁיחוֹ;  
לְדָוִד וּלְזַרְעוֹ עַד־עוֹלָם.
The closing doxology gathers up the psalm’s themes into praise. “חַי־ה׳, YHWH lives”—unlike the inert idols of the nations—and “בָּרוּךְ צוּרִי, blessed be my Rock.” The rock metaphors from v. 3 return with a liturgical ring; this line, in various permutations, appears in Shabbat piyyutim and personal prayers.
Verse 48 names God as “הַנּוֹתֵן נְקָמוֹת לִי, the One who gives me vindications.” “Vengeance” (נְקָמָה) in biblical idiom is less about personal spite than about setting things right, restoring violated order. Deuteronomy 32:35 has God say, “לִי נָקָם וְשִׁלֵּם, Vengeance is Mine and recompense.” Here, God shares that work with His king: He “subdues peoples under me” (וַיַּדְבֵּר עַמִּים תַּחְתָּי). The verb ידבר here likely means “leads” or “brings under,” related to “shepherding,” rather than “speaks.”
Verse 49 summarizes the personal strand one last time: God is “מְפַלְּטִי, my deliverer, from my enemies,” exalting David “above those who rise against me,” rescuing him from “אִישׁ חָמָס, a man of violence”—understood by many as Saul, though it applies paradigmatically to any unjust aggressor.
Verses 50–51 broaden the horizon again: “Therefore I will praise You among the nations.” Paul will later quote this line in Romans 15:9 to argue for Gentile inclusion; in its original context it reflects a Davidic king whose victories force surrounding nations to reckon with Israel’s God. The final line, with its reference to “מְשִׁיחוֹ… לְדָוִד וּלְזַרְעוֹ עַד־עוֹלָם, His anointed… David and his seed forever,” transforms the song from autobiography into charter. David’s experience of rescue becomes the template for an enduring dynasty bound to God’s ḥesed.
Because of this, the verse has rightly become the last word at the Jewish table. Every time a family ends Birkat HaMazon with “He magnifies victories for His king,” they are quietly aligning their everyday gratitude with this old royal song, and with a hope that the story it sketches—a humbled, rescued king, vindicated among nations—has not yet finished unfolding.
