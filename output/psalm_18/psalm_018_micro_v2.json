  "interesting_questions": [
    "Why does the psalm use TWO different Hebrew words for 'rock' (sela' and tsur) in v.3 - are they truly synonymous or do they carry distinct nuances (cliff vs. boulder, natural formation vs. worked stone)?",
    "What exactly is 'Belial' (בְלִיַּעַל) in v.5 - is it a proper name for a deity/demon (like in Qumran texts), an abstract concept of worthlessness/chaos, or a poetic personification of destruction? How does LXX's 'lawlessness' interpretation affect meaning?",
    "How should we interpret the shocking claim in v.36 that 'Your humility/care (עַנְוַתְךָ) made me great' - does this suggest divine condescension, gentleness, or discipline, and what does it mean theologically for God to possess 'humility'?",
    "What is the relationship between the righteousness claims (vv.21-25) and grace theology elsewhere in Scripture - is this ancient royal ideology, conditional covenant theology, or does it represent a different theological framework than later prophetic thought?",
    "Why does the psalm shift from mythological enemies (Death, Belial, Sheol in vv.5-6) to human enemies (v.18ff) - are these the same entities metaphorized, or does the psalm conflate spiritual and physical warfare intentionally?",
    "How does the psalm's theophany (vv.8-16) relate to other biblical theophanies (Sinai, Elijah, Job 38-41) and to Ugaritic Baal texts - what is the theological significance of appropriating Canaanite storm-god imagery for YHWH?",
    "What does 'horn of salvation' (קֶרֶן־יִשְׁעִי) in v.3 actually signify - altar horn, animal horn as strength symbol, or something else, and how does this relate to later 'horn of David' messianic imagery?",
    "Is the 'temple' (הֵיכָל) in v.7 from which God hears the earthly Jerusalem temple (anachronistic for David's early reign), a heavenly temple, or a cosmic palace - and what does each option suggest about temple theology?",
    "Why does v.42 claim enemies cried to YHWH but weren't answered - does this assume they are Israelites with covenant rights, or is it polemical rhetoric showing YHWH's definitive choice of David over all opponents?",
    "How does the 'mighty waters' (מַיִם רַבִּים) imagery function across the psalm (vv.5, 16, 17) - is this Exodus typology (Red Sea), creation mythology (Tehom/chaos), or both, and how do these traditions interact?",
    "What is the significance of the cherub (כְּרוּב) riding imagery in v.11 - is this ONE cherub or the cherub class, and how does it relate to ark theology, temple decoration, and Ezekiel's visions?",
    "Why does the psalm expand from personal deliverance from Saul (v.1) to international dominion over unknown peoples (vv.44-46) - is this historical telescoping of David's reign, liturgical generalization, or eschatological vision?",
    "How should modern readers ethically engage the graphic violence of vv.38-43 ('ground them fine as dust') - is this hyperbolic ancient Near Eastern victory rhetoric, reflection of actual warfare practices, or something to be critiqued rather than celebrated?",
    "What is the function of the wisdom-style section (vv.26-28) within a royal victory psalm - does this represent genre mixing, or is there an integrated royal-wisdom ideology in the monarchic period?",
    "How does the 'cleanness of hands' (בֹר יָדַי) language in vv.21, 25 function - is this about ritual purity (qualification for temple/divine audience), ethical conduct, or royal ideology where king must be blameless to receive divine empowerment?"
