## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (0)

*No macro research questions.*

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (10)

1. Why does the psalm pair archaic 'tent' language with permanent 'holy mountain' imagery in v.1 - is this deliberate merging of tabernacle and temple traditions?
2. What exactly does 'speaks truth in his heart' (דֹבֵר אֱמֶת בִּלְבָבוֹ) mean - internal self-honesty, truthful thinking, or something else? How does this differ from speaking truth to others?
3. What is the semantic relationship between רֵעֵהוּ (fellow) and קְרֹבוֹ (close one) in v.3 - expanding circles of responsibility, synonymous parallelism, or specific social categories?
4. Why is the contemptible person described with doubled language (נִבְזֶה...נִמְאָס) while God-fearers get single term (יִרְאֵי יְהֹוָה) - rhetorical emphasis or semantic distinction?
5. Does נִשְׁבַּע לְהָרַע mean taking an oath that turns out costly, or deliberately making a costly commitment? What's the nature of this 'swearing to hurt'?
6. Why does the psalm climax with economic sins (interest-taking, bribery) rather than cultic/ritual offenses - what does this prioritization reveal about the psalm's theology?
7. How does the stability promise (לֹא יִמּוֹט לְעוֹלָֽם) answer the dwelling question (מִי־יָגוּר...מִי־יִשְׁכֹּן) - are these metaphorically equivalent or distinct concepts?
8. What is the significance of the LXX translating 'swears to his hurt' as 'swears to his neighbor' - which reading is original and what interpretive implications?
9. Why are participles used throughout for ethical description - does habitual/ongoing aspect have theological significance vs. perfect tense completion?
10. What's the function of the unusual phrase רָגַל עַל־לְשֹׁנוֹ - does ragal mean 'spy/slander' or literally 'walk/go about' and how does this work with 'on tongue'?
