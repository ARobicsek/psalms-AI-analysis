# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 15

The existing introduction and commentary have a strong backbone. They correctly see Psalm 15 as an “entrance psalm” organized around a liturgical question (v. 1) and a compact ethical answer (vv. 2–5), and they give a solid account of key terms like תָּמִים (“blameless, whole”) and רָגַל (“go about as a slanderer”). The draft also gestures toward intertextual links with Psalm 24 and prophetic critiques of empty ritual, and it includes an initial (if brief) note on modern liturgical use.

Several weaknesses, however, keep it from excellence.

1. **Overdrawn thesis.** The introduction repeatedly contrasts “ethical” with “ritual,” as if Psalm 15 rejected cultic categories outright. But terms like תָּמִים and the imagery of tent and holy mountain are deeply cultic. The psalm relocates holiness into character without abandoning the Temple frame. That nuance is missing.

2. **Underused research.**  
   - The Torah Temimah’s rich Talmudic material is barely tapped. In *Makkot* 24a, Psalm 15 is David’s eleven-point condensation of all 613 commandments; in *Bava Batra* 88a (“Rav Safra and ‘speaks truth in his heart’”), and *Bava Metzia* 71a (interest and “not be shaken”), the psalm becomes a touchstone for rabbinic ethics. These are central for reception history and for understanding how rigorously the tradition read this psalm.  
   - The figurative language database provides striking parallels for “tent,” “holy mountain,” and “not being shaken,” yet the draft rarely quotes them or shows patterns of usage.

3. **Missed structural and literary depth.** The commentary notes “synthetic parallelism” and “inclusio” but does not define these for non-specialists. The subtle movement from inner truth (v. 2) to guarded speech (v. 3) to economic justice (v. 5) can be sharpened, as can the chiastic echo between “walking blamelessly” and “not walking about with the tongue.”

4. **Figurative and liturgical use underdeveloped.** The Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur piyyutim that quote v. 4 are mentioned but not shown in Hebrew; the Edot ha-Mizrach mourning practice is noted but not tied deeply to the psalm’s theology. Likewise, parallels like Psalm 3:5 or 99:9 (“his holy hill”) and Proverbs 10:30 (“the righteous will never be shaken”) are alluded to but not quoted.

The revision should (1) nuance the ethics–ritual relationship, (2) integrate rabbinic and liturgical reception, (3) exploit the figurative and concordance data with concrete examples in Hebrew and English, and (4) define technical terms for an intelligent lay reader.
