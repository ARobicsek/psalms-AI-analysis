#### Verse 1

יְהוָה, מִי־יָגוּר בְּאָהֳלֶךָ; מִי־יִשְׁכֹּן בְּהַר־קׇדְשֶׁךָ׃  

“LORD, who may sojourn in Your tent; who may dwell on Your holy mountain?”

The psalm begins with a double question, each half finely shaded. The address “LORD” (יְהוָה) is immediately followed by the interrogative מִי (“who”), repeated: “Who may sojourn… who may dwell…?” The repetition slows the line and gives it a ritual weight, as if it were part of a call-and-response at the Temple gate.

The first verb, יָגוּר (from גוּר), means “to sojourn,” to live for a time as a resident alien or guest. It is the verb used of the patriarchs “sojourning” in Canaan and of the *gēr* living in Israel. To ask “who may sojourn in Your tent” is to acknowledge that even the most pious Israelite enters God’s space as a guest, not an owner. Radak, reading more cosmically, understands “Your tent” (אֹהֶלְךָ) as the heavens themselves, stretched out like a tent, echoing Isaiah’s image of God “who spreads them [the skies] out like a tent to dwell in” (וַיִּמְתָּחֵם כָּאֹהֶל לָשָׁבֶת, Isaiah 40:22).

The second verb, יִשְׁכֹּן (from שָׁכַן), is the standard term for dwelling or indwelling. It is used of God’s presence in the Tabernacle (“Let them make Me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them” – וְשָׁכַנְתִּי בְּתוֹכָם, Exodus 25:8) and of people “dwelling securely” in the land. The movement from sojourning to dwelling hints at an ascent from temporary access to lasting rootedness.

The parallel images—“Your tent” and “Your holy mountain”—are not simple synonyms. The tent evokes the desert Tabernacle, intimate and portable. The holy mountain suggests stability and public prominence. Psalm 48 speaks of “His holy mountain” (הַר־קׇדְשׁוֹ) as “beautiful in elevation, joy of all the earth” (יְפֵה נוֹף מְשׂוֹשׂ כָּל־הָאָרֶץ, 48:3). Psalm 3:5 and 99:9, as we have seen, use “holy mountain/hill” as a shorthand for God’s dwelling and the locus of answered prayer.

The verse also stands in direct dialogue with Psalm 24:3:

> מִי־יַעֲלֶה בְהַר־יְהוָה; וּמִי־יָקוּם בִּמְקוֹם קׇדְשׁוֹ׃  
> “Who shall ascend the hill of the LORD, and who shall stand in His holy place?”

There the verbs are dynamic and vertical—ascend, stand—fitting a procession of worshipers approaching the Temple. Psalm 15’s verbs—sojourn, dwell—suggest not merely a visit but a way of life. Both psalms, however, pose an entrance question whose answer will turn out to be ethical rather than genealogical or merely ritual.

The Greek Septuagint, an early translation, renders “sojourn” with παροικήσει (“will dwell as a sojourner”) and “dwell” with κατασκηνώσει (“encamp”). The Greek preserves the sense of privileged, camp-like proximity. Both Hebrew and Greek, then, press us to imagine worship not as a one-off act but as taking up residence—however humbly—within God’s sphere.

What follows in the psalm is best heard as a response to this opening liturgical challenge. The “tent” and “holy mountain” remain literal and symbolic; the rest of the psalm will explore what sort of character can inhabit them.

#### Verse 2

הוֹלֵךְ תָּמִים; וּפֹעֵל צֶדֶק; וְדֹבֵר אֱמֶת בִּלְבָבוֹ׃  

“One who walks blamelessly; who does what is right; and speaks truth in his heart.”

Verse 2 replies to the entrance question with a threefold sketch, moving from the general course of life (walking), to specific acts (doing), to the inner life (the heart). Each phrase adds a layer.

“Walks blamelessly” (הוֹלֵךְ תָּמִים) uses the biblical idiom of “walking” to describe the overall conduct of life. תָּמִים, from the root תמם, denotes completeness or soundness. It is applied to unblemished sacrificial animals and to human beings of integrity. Jacob is called an “אִישׁ תָּם” (a “sound” or “quiet” man, Genesis 25:27), Noah is “צַדִּיק תָּמִים” (Genesis 6:9), and Abraham is commanded “הִתְהַלֵּךְ לְפָנַי וֶהְיֵה תָמִים” (“Walk before Me and be blameless,” Genesis 17:1). The psalm taps this covenantal vocabulary: to be fit for God’s tent is to live as a “whole” person, not double-minded or fractured.

The next phrase, “does what is right” (פֹּעֵל צֶדֶק), shifts from overall posture to concrete deeds. צֶדֶק in biblical usage is relational rightness—fair dealing, keeping one’s word, giving each their due. Malbim, with his fine-grained distinctions, notes that this is especially about commandments “between human beings,” the social fabric.

The third clause, “speaks truth in his heart” (דֹבֵר אֱמֶת בִּלְבָבוֹ), deepens the focus further. We are not told merely that he “speaks truth,” but that the truth-telling is located “in his heart.” Rashi glosses: “The good that he says in his heart is truth; he is not one thing in the mouth and another in the heart.” In other words, Psalm 15 is concerned not only with factual accuracy but with the alignment of inner conviction and outer speech.

The Talmud gives this line flesh in the story of Rav Safra (בבא בתרא 88א). While he was reciting the *Shema*, a man approached to buy something and named a price. Unable to interrupt his prayer, Rav Safra did not answer. The would-be buyer, assuming refusal, raised the offer. After finishing the *Shema*, Rav Safra insisted on the *original* price, explaining that in his heart he had already accepted it. The rabbis link this to “speaks truth in his heart”: inner consent already bound him.

From a literary angle, the verse exemplifies what scholars call “synthetic parallelism”—a pattern where each colon (each half-line) adds to the previous one rather than merely restating it. We might paraphrase: A life for God’s tent is one whose overall path is whole, whose dealings are just, and whose inner dialogue is truthful. Verse 3 will then sharpen this picture by saying what such a person *does not* say or do.

#### Verse 3

לֹא־רָגַל עַל־לְשׁוֹנוֹ; לֹא־עָשָׂה לְרֵעֵהוּ רָעָה; וְחֶרְפָּה לֹא־נָשָׂא עַל־קְרֹבוֹ׃  

“Who does not go about as a slanderer on his tongue; does no evil to his neighbor; and does not lift up reproach against his close relative.”

After the positive affirmations of verse 2, verse 3 sketches prohibitions. The repeated לֹא (“not”) at the start of each colon gives the line a rhythmic, almost legal feel. The focus is on avoiding harm in three spheres: speech, general neighborly relations, and ties to kin.

The unusual phrase לֹא־רָגַל עַל־לְשׁוֹנוֹ (literally, “has not footed [or gone about] on his tongue”) draws on the denominative verb רָגַל, from רֶגֶל (“foot”). BDB notes two main uses: to go about as a spy and to slander. The image here is vivid: the tongue is imagined as if it had feet—tramping around, prying, carrying tales. II Samuel 19:28 uses the same verb: “He slandered your servant to my lord the king” (וַיְרַגֵּל בְּעַבְדְּךָ). Our psalm says that the righteous person simply refuses to let his tongue go roaming in that way.

The next clause, “has not done evil to his neighbor” (לֹא־עָשָׂה לְרֵעֵהוּ רָעָה), balances the previous positive “does what is right.” Here רֵעַ is the general “neighbor, companion.” Harm can be active injury, but in context it includes what we might call character assassination; Radak reads verse 3 as covering both deed and word.

The final phrase is difficult: “and reproach he has not lifted up against his close one” (וְחֶרְפָּה לֹא־נָשָׂא עַל־קְרֹבוֹ). The verb נָשָׂא (“lift, carry”) is the same one used in the Ninth Commandment: “You shall not *bear* false witness” (לֹא־תִשָּׂא עֵד שָׁקֵר, Exodus 20:13). Psalm 24:4, our companion entrance psalm, says of the pure-hearted worshiper: “who has not lifted up his soul to what is false” (אֲשֶׁר לֹא־נָשָׂא לַשָּׁוְא נַפְשִׁי). In Psalm 15, the object is “reproach” (חֶרְפָּה) and the target is “his close one” (קָרוֹב), a relative or intimate.

Three main readings have emerged. Rashi argues that if his relative has committed a punishable offense, the righteous person does not “carry” the reproach by covering it up and so gives no one cause to say, “You hid your kinsman’s crime.” Metzudat David, more simply, takes it as “he does not cast reproach upon his relative,” i.e., he does not shame him publicly. Others hear “does not *take up* reproach against” in the sense of refusing to join in gossip or repeat a slander.

The Greek translators understood it that way: “and reproach he does not *receive* against his near one” (ὀνειδισμὸν οὐ λαμβάνει ἐπὶ τὸν ἐγγὺς αὐτοῦ). The righteous person refuses both to originate and to propagate shame.

The term “reproach” (חֶרְפָּה) often describes the social state of being mocked or scorned: “We have become the reproach of our neighbors, the scorn and derision of those around us” (הָיִינוּ חֶרְפָּה לִשְׁכֵנֵינוּ, Psalm 79:4). Psalm 15’s ideal worshiper is one who will neither create such a state for others nor gain social capital by trading in it.

Taken together, verse 3 traces a movement from the tongue “walking” about, to the hand “doing” harm, to the heart’s attitude toward those closest to us. It concretizes the commitment of verse 2: inner truth and just action require disciplined speech and a refusal to weaponize either gossip or kinship.

#### Verse 4

נִבְזֶה בְעֵינָיו נִמְאָס; וְאֶת־יִרְאֵי יְהוָה יְכַבֵּד; נִשְׁבַּע לְהָרַע וְלֹא יָמִר׃  

“Despised in his eyes, rejected; but those who fear the LORD he honors; he has sworn to his own hurt and does not change.”

This verse probes the worshiper’s value system and reliability. It asks: Whom do you admire? Whom do you refuse to admire? And what do you do when your own promises cost you?

The opening clause, נִבְזֶה בְעֵינָיו נִמְאָס, is compact and grammatically ambiguous. Both נִבְזֶה (“despised”) and נִמְאָס (“rejected, loathed”) can function as participles (“one who is despised… rejected”). The phrase could be read:

- **Object-focused (Rashi, liturgy):** “The one who is vile is despised and rejected in his eyes.” That is: the righteous person does not flatter or curry favor with evildoers. Rashi illustrates with King Hezekiah, who humiliatingly dragged his idolatrous father’s bones on a bed of ropes (Pesachim 56a).

- **Self-focused (Radak, Meiri):** “Despised in his own eyes, he is rejected.” Here the righteous person is deeply humble, thinking of his own merits as meagre compared to what he owes God.

The Rosh Hashanah piyyut quoted above (“The Mighty One does not despise…”) cleverly uses the psalm’s phrase of human ethics to describe God’s sifting of the truly “vile” from the merely small and penitent.

The second colon offers a positive counterpart: “and those who fear the LORD he honors” (וְאֶת־יִרְאֵי יְהוָה יְכַבֵּד). To “fear the LORD” (יִרְאַת יְהוָה) in biblical idiom means a posture of reverence, obedience, and awe. The righteous person uses his social capital to raise the profile of such people. As we saw, a piyyut transforms this into: “The house of Israel and those who fear the LORD will honor and thank Your name, O LORD” (בֵּית יִשְׂרָאֵל וְיִרְאֵי יְהוָה, יְכַבְּדוּ וְיוֹדוּ שִׁמְךָ יְהוָה). Human honor for the God-fearing becomes collective honor of God.

The final colon introduces what is perhaps the psalm’s sternest demand: “He has sworn to his own hurt and does not change” (נִשְׁבַּע לְהָרַע וְלֹא יָמִר). Literally, he has “sworn to the evil [for himself].” Rashi reads this as “to harm himself” (לְהָרַע לְעַצְמוֹ): for example, he vows to give a generous gift or to undertake a demanding task. When circumstances change and the vow becomes genuinely costly, he does not look for technicalities to get out of it.

The verb יָמִיר (“change, exchange”) appears in Leviticus 27’s laws about consecrated animals: “he shall not exchange it nor substitute it” (לֹא יַמִּיר אֹתוֹ וְלֹא יָמִיר אֹתוֹ טוֹב בְּרָע, 27:10). There, the danger is backtracking on a holy gift; here, it is backtracking on one’s word. The Septuagint generalizes: “He has sworn to his neighbor and does not nullify it” (ὁ ὀμνύων τῷ πλησίον αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἀθετῶν).

There is a deliberate resonance with Psalm 24:4, which praises those who “have not sworn deceitfully” (לֹא נִשְׁבַּע לְמִרְמָה). Both psalms assume the wider biblical caution against making vows lightly (e.g., Ecclesiastes 5:3–4). The ideal is not an impulsive piety of constant oaths, but a sobriety where one’s “yes” is costly and therefore rare.

In terms of structure, verse 4 continues the telescoping movement from verse 3: how one positions oneself with respect to the wicked and the devout (whom do you despise, whom do you honor?) and how one positions oneself with respect to one’s own speech (do you treat your word as binding?). Together they form a bridge between the “horizontal” ethics of verse 3 and the economic-judicial sphere of verse 5.

#### Verse 5

כַּסְפּוֹ לֹא־נָתַן בְּנֶשֶׁךְ; וְשֹׁחַד עַל־נָקִי לֹא־לָקָח; עֹשֵׂה־אֵלֶּה לֹא יִמּוֹט לְעוֹלָם׃  

“His money he has not given at interest; and a bribe against the innocent he has not taken; one who does these things shall never be shaken.”

The psalm’s ethical catalogue ends where so many human stories go wrong: with money and the law.

“His money he has not given at interest” (כַּסְפּוֹ לֹא־נָתַן בְּנֶשֶׁךְ). נֶשֶׁךְ means “interest,” but its root נָשַׁךְ means “to bite.” The term pictures interest as something that bites off a piece of the debtor’s flesh. Torah law repeatedly bans this “bite” within the covenant community:

> “If you lend money to My people, to the poor among you, do not be to him like a creditor; you shall not impose *interest* on him” (לֹא־תִהְיֶה לוֹ כְּנֹשֶׁה; לֹא־תְשִׂימוּן עָלָיו נֶשֶׁךְ, Exodus 22:24).  
> “You shall not give him your money on interest, nor give him your food for profit” (לֹא־תִתֵּן לוֹ נֶשֶׁךְ; וּבְמַרְבִּית לֹא־תִתֵּן אָכְלֶךָ, Leviticus 25:37).

Radak observes that even when the borrower “consents,” his need constrains him; the lender is thus taking what is not justly his. Because interest can be socially acceptable—“no one calls it robbery,” as Radak puts it—the psalm highlights it as a subtle form of injustice that easily passes under the radar.

The next phrase, “and a bribe against the innocent he has not taken” (וְשֹׁחַד עַל־נָקִי לֹא־לָקָח), targets the judicial system. Exodus 23:8 already warns, “You shall not take a bribe [שֹׁחַד], for a bribe blinds the clear-sighted and subverts the words of the righteous.” Rashi, drawing on *Sifrei*, stresses that even a bribe meant to acquit an innocent person is forbidden, because it corrupts the judge’s impartiality.

The Torah Temimah cites *Bava Metzia* 71a, where Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar comments on our verse: “Anyone who has money and lends it without interest—about him Scripture says, ‘His money he has not given at interest… One who does these things shall not be shaken forever.’ From this you learn that whoever lends on interest, his possessions *totter* (מתמוטטין).” The pun on מוֹט (“totter”) is deliberate, tying economic exploitation to instability.

The closing promise, “One who does these things shall never be shaken” (עֹשֵׂה־אֵלֶּה לֹא יִמּוֹט לְעוֹלָם), serves as an inclusio with the question of dwelling on God’s mountain. To “not be shaken” evokes physical stability—an image used elsewhere for the security of the righteous: “He is my rock and my salvation… I shall not be shaken” (לֹא אֶמּוֹט, Psalm 62:7); “The righteous will never be shaken” (צַדִּיק לְעוֹלָם בַּל־יִמּוֹט, Proverbs 10:30); “Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved but abides forever” (לֹא יִמּוֹט לְעוֹלָם, Psalm 125:1). Psalm 121, a pilgrim psalm, uses the same root for divine protection of the traveler’s footing: “He will not give your foot to be moved” (אַל־יִתֵּן לַמּוֹט רַגְלֶךָ, 121:3).

Here, however, the stability is promised to “one who does *these things*.” The phrase gathers up the whole list: inner truth, guarded speech, loyalty that does not excuse wrongdoing, reverence for the God-fearing, costly fidelity to one’s word, generosity without exploitation, and unswayed justice. Malbim provocatively notes that even refraining from evil (“not doing” certain things) is called “doing” (עֹשֵׂה־אֵלֶּה), because the human impulse pulls toward self-interest; resisting that pull is itself a positive act.

Rashi adds a pastoral gloss: “If he falters, his faltering will not be forever, but he stumbles and rises.” The point is not that a righteous person never has reversals, but that a life ordered around the ethics of Psalm 15 shares something of Mount Zion’s moral granite. The psalm that began by asking who might dwell on God’s holy mountain ends by promising that those who embody these traits will themselves possess a share in that mountain’s unshakable endurance.
