### Verse 1

יְהוָה, מִי־יָגוּר בְּאׇהֳלֶךָ; מִי־יִשְׁכֹּן בְּהַר־קׇדְשֶׁךָ׃

The psalm opens not with a declaration of praise but with a profound, two-part liturgical question that immediately frames its theological inquiry. The parallel structure is synonymous, with both clauses asking who may dwell with God, yet the imagery chosen, `בְּאׇהֳלֶךָ` (in Your tent) and `בְּהַר־קׇדְשֶׁךָ` (on Your holy mountain), evokes different and complementary aspects of divine communion. The "tent" (`אֹהֶל`) recalls the portable Tabernacle from the wilderness period, a symbol of God's intimate, sojourning presence among His people. As the Radak explains, this metaphor can extend to the heavens themselves, which are "spread out as a tent." Conversely, the "holy mountain" points to a permanent, established sanctuary, likely Mount Zion in Jerusalem, the locus of national, public worship. Ibn Ezra identifies this as Mount Moriah, the site of the Temple. This strategic pairing of images—intimate tent and grand mountain—asks a comprehensive question: who is worthy of both close fellowship with God and a place in His sacred community?

The verbal choice for "dwell" in each clause adds another layer of nuance. `יָגוּר` is not a permanent dwelling but a "sojourning," implying a temporary, yet privileged, status as a guest or resident alien. In contrast, `יִשְׁכֹּן` suggests a more permanent, settled "dwelling." The psalmist is therefore asking who qualifies for both the intimate, transient fellowship of a guest in God's presence and the stable, enduring residency of a citizen in the holy city. The deliberate repetition of the interrogative `מִי` ("who") transforms the verse from a simple query into a dramatic and challenging quest for the very definition of holiness. This opening sets the stage for the psalm's central argument: that the answer will be found not in ritual purity or heritage, but in the moral and ethical character of the individual.

### Verse 2

הֹולֵךְ תָּמִים, וּפֹעֵל צֶדֶק; וְדֹבֵר אֱמֶת בִּלְבָבוֹ׃

This verse provides the initial, threefold answer to the opening question, beginning with the very core of a person's being. The description progresses from general conduct to specific action and finally to the hidden intention of the heart, forming a synthetic parallelism where each clause builds upon the last to create a holistic portrait of integrity. The psalmist begins with character, moves to external deeds, and culminates in the source of both: the heart.

The first quality, `הֹולֵךְ תָּמִים` ("walks blamelessly"), employs a common biblical metaphor where "walking" signifies one's entire course of life. The adjective `תָּמִים` (tamim) is crucial, signifying not simple innocence but a state of being "whole, complete, sound." It is the same word used to describe Noah and Abraham in their covenantal relationship with God (Genesis 6:9; 17:1). As Rashi notes on Genesis 17:1, this entails walking "before Me and be perfect." Thus, the psalm is invoking a standard of complete, unwavering, and wholehearted devotion to God, setting an exceedingly high bar for fellowship.

This internal integrity is immediately externalized in the second clause, `וּפֹעֵל צֶדֶק` ("and does what is right"). A blameless heart must manifest in righteous actions toward others. The verse culminates with a striking and profound idiom: `וְדֹבֵר אֱמֶת בִּלְבָבוֹ` ("and speaks truth in his heart"). This is more than just honesty in speech. It suggests that truth is so internalized that it has become one’s core conviction; one's inner dialogue is aligned with reality and righteousness. As Rashi succinctly puts it, "The good that he says in his heart is true. He is not a hypocrite." This seamless integration of thought, word, and deed establishes the foundation upon which all the other ethical requirements in the psalm are built.

### Verse 3

אֲשֶׁר לֹא־רָגַל עַל־לְשֹׁנוֹ; לֹא־עָשָׂה לְרֵעֵהוּ רָעָה, וְחֶרְפָּה לֹא־נָשָׂא עַל־קְרֹבוֹ׃

Following the positive foundation of verse 2, the psalmist now shifts to what the righteous person *does not do*, employing a powerful series of negative prohibitions to sharpen the portrait. The focus of verse 3 is entirely on preventing harm to others, whether by slander, direct action, or the destruction of reputation. The opening phrase, `לֹא־רָגַל עַל־לְשֹׁנוֹ` (literally "does not walk with his tongue"), is a striking and rare idiom. As the BDB lexicon notes, `רָגַל` here denotes a malicious "going about," creating a vivid, almost sinister image of the tongue as a foot that travels to spread trouble. The tongue is not merely an instrument in the mouth but an agent that "goes abroad" to sow discord. This is a more active and insidious image than simple slander, implying a persistent campaign of defamation. Rashi explains it as a form of accusation, citing `וַיְרַגֵּל בְּעַבְדְּךָ` (II Samuel 19:28) as a parallel.

The verse then expands its scope of ethical concern through a careful progression of relationships. First, the general neighbor (`רֵעֵהוּ`) is protected from any "evil" (`רָעָה`). Then, in the final clause, the responsibility extends to one's `קְרֹבוֹ` (kinsman or close associate). The term `חֶרְפָּה` (reproach, scorn) is significant, as the righteous person does not "take up" or "accept" it. As the Meiri understands it, this means one does not bring a reproach upon a neighbor through one's own actions, and as Rashi explains, it also means not "taking up" a reproach against them, thus protecting them from being shamed. This verse masterfully outlines a fundamental principle of biblical ethics: true holiness is demonstrated in the active protection of others' dignity, well-being, and reputation.

### Verse 4

נִבְזֶה בְעֵינָיו נִמְאָס, וְאֶת־יִרְאֵי יְהוָה יְכַבֵּד; נִשְׁבַּע לְהָרַע, וְלֹא יָמִר׃

This verse sharpens the portrait of integrity by testing the worshipper's value system and commitment. It presents a stark contrast, defining the righteous person by what they despise and what they honor, and then by their willingness to keep a promise at great personal cost. The first line, `נִבְזֶה בְעֵינָיו נִמְאָס`, is syntactically ambiguous and has been interpreted in two primary ways. The phrase could describe the wicked person, who is naturally rejected by the righteous. However, as Radak and the Meiri suggest, it more likely describes the righteous person’s profound humility and self-abnegation; in his own eyes, he is "despised" and "rejected" (`נִמְאָס`), so focused is he on his duty to God that he counts his own good deeds as nothing. This deep humility is the prerequisite for true honor.

This humility is paired with an active commitment: `וְאֶת־יִרְאֵי יְהוָה יְכַבֵּד` ("and honors those who fear the LORD"). The verb `יְכַבֵּד` implies more than passive respect; it suggests active esteem, patronage, and public support for the community of the faithful. The righteous person uses his influence to elevate those who share his values, creating a subculture that honors God.

The final clause introduces the ultimate test of character: costly promise-keeping. `נִשְׁבַּע לְהָרַע וְלֹא יָמִר` is notoriously difficult. Literally, "he swears to evil and does not change." The prevailing and most compelling view, as Rashi explains, is that one "swears to his own hurt" (`לְהָרַע` as `לְהַרַע לְעַצְמוֹ`) and does not retract the oath even when it causes personal loss. The verb `יָמִר` means to change or alter, so he does not "change his word." Integrity, the psalm insists, is not convenient; it is a commitment that stands firm even when it is to one’s own detriment.

### Verse 5a

כַּסְפּוֹ לֹא־נָתַן בְּנֶשֶׁךְ, וְשֹׁחַד עַל־נָקִי לֹא־לָקַח׃

The final requirements for dwelling with God ground the lofty ideals of the previous verses in the gritty realities of economics and social justice. The psalmist places these two financial prohibitions at the very end of the list, suggesting they are the climactic and perhaps most difficult tests of a person's character. The psalm argues that true righteousness is not confined to the synagogue or the prayer closet; it extends into the marketplace.

The first prohibition, `כַּסְפּוֹ לֹא־נָתַן בְּנֶשֶׁךְ` ("his money he does not give at interest"), is a direct echo of Torah law (Exodus 22:24; Leviticus 25:36-37). The term `נֶשֶׁךְ` (neshekh) literally means "a bite," powerfully illustrating how interest was seen as a predatory act that gnaws away at the vulnerable. The Radak explains that even if a loan is given with the borrower's consent, the prohibition against interest remains, because the borrower's need makes consent less than free.

The second prohibition, `וְשֹׁחַד עַל־נָקִי לֹא־לָקַח` ("and a bribe against the innocent he does not take"), strikes at the heart of a just society. A `שֹׁחַד` (shochad) is a bribe, and as Rashi and the Torah Temimah (quoting the Sifrei) clarify, this includes not only bribes to condemn the innocent but even bribes to acquit them, as it perverts the course of justice. By positioning these two economic sins as the final barriers to divine fellowship, the psalm makes a radical theological statement: one cannot harm a neighbor in verse 3 and then exploit him financially in verse 5. Economic exploitation is not a peripheral vice; it is a central offense that violates the very integrity required to stand in God's presence.

### Verse 5b

עֹשֵׂה־אֵלֶּה לֹא יִמּוֹט לְעוֹלָם׃

This concluding promise functions as a powerful *inclusio*, creating a frame that reinterprets the opening question. The psalm began by asking who may "sojourn" (`יָגוּר`) and "dwell" (`יִשְׁכֹּן`) in God's sacred space; it ends by promising a state of being eternally "unshaken" (`לֹא יִמּוֹט`). The metaphorical concept of "dwelling with God" has been transformed from a physical location to a permanent condition of divine security and stability. As the introduction essay notes, the place is the person.

The verb `יִמּוֹט` (yimot) means to totter, shake, or be overthrown. It is used frequently in the Psalms to describe the instability of the wicked (Psalm 10:6; 12:3) and the enduring security of the righteous. This verse echoes the promise of Psalm 125:1, `כִּי־יְהוָה צוּרִי וּמְצוּדָתִי ... לֹא־יִמּוֹט לְעוֹלָם` ("Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but endures forever"). The finality of `לְעוֹלָם` ("forever" or "for an age") secures this promise in an eternal timeframe. The reward for a life of holistic integrity is not material wealth or entrance to a physical temple, but an unshakable spiritual state. The person who embodies this ethical character *becomes* the sacred space, eternally secure in the presence of God. This is the psalm’s ultimate answer to its own searching question.
