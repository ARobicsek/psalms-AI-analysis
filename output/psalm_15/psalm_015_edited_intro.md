“LORD, who may sojourn in Your tent, who may dwell on Your holy mountain?” (יְהוָה מִי־יָגוּר בְּאָהֳלֶךָ; מִי־יִשְׁכֹּן בְּהַר קׇדְשֶׁךָ, v. 1).  

Psalm 15 opens like a question shouted toward a sanctuary gate. It is one of the Bible’s most concentrated attempts to ask: *What kind of life truly belongs in God’s presence?*

#### 1. Tent and mountain: where is “God’s house”?

The psalm’s frame is unmistakably cultic. The “tent” (אֹהֶל) evokes the wilderness Tabernacle, the moveable shrine of God’s presence among Israel; the “holy mountain” (הַר קׇדְשֶׁךָ) points to Zion, the Temple mount. Elsewhere, that phrase is clearly a metonymy—a physical place standing in for God’s presence and rule: “I cry aloud to the LORD, and He answers me from His holy mountain” (מֵהַר קׇדְשׁוֹ, Psalm 3:5); “Bow down toward His holy hill” (לְהַר קׇדְשׁוֹ, Psalm 99:9).

The first verb, יָגוּר, means “to sojourn,” to live as a temporary resident or *gēr*, a guest without full rights. By contrast, יִשְׁכֹּן (“dwell”) is the verb used for God’s own indwelling—“the LORD is enthroned… who dwells in Zion” (יְהוָה שֹׁכֵן צִיּוֹן, Psalm 9:12). The question therefore has a double edge: Who may be a guest in God’s house, and who may settle there with the stability of a citizen?

Traditional commentators move in both directions. Radak takes “tent” as the heavens themselves “spread out like a tent” over the earth, echoing Isaiah’s metaphor: “He stretches out the skies like gauze, and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in” (הַנּוֹטֶה כַדֹּק שָׁמַיִם; וַיִּמְתָּחֵם כָּאֹהֶל לָשָׁבֶת, Isaiah 40:22). Others, like Ibn Ezra and Metzudat David, think more concretely of the Temple in Jerusalem. In either case, sacred space is taken seriously. The psalm is not indifferent to ritual; instead, it asks what kind of character *corresponds* to that holy place.

Psalm 15 sits in a small cluster of “entrance psalms.” Psalm 24 poses an almost identical question: “Who shall ascend the hill of the LORD, and who shall stand in His holy place?” (מִי־יַעֲלֶה בְהַר־יְהוָה; וּמִי־יָקוּם בִּמְקוֹם קׇדְשׁוֹ, Psalm 24:3). But whereas Psalm 24 answers with cultic-ethical imagery—“clean hands and a pure heart… not sworn deceitfully” (נְקִי כַפַּיִם וּבַר־לֵבָב… וְלֹא נִשְׁבַּע לְמִרְמָה, 24:4)—Psalm 15 unfolds a more elaborated portrait of daily righteousness.

#### 2. A life “whole” before God (v. 2)

The answer begins with three compact phrases:

> הוֹלֵךְ תָּמִים; וּפֹעֵל צֶדֶק; וְדֹבֵר אֱמֶת בִּלְבָבוֹ׃  
> “One who walks blamelessly, does what is right, and speaks truth in his heart.”

The verb “walks” (הוֹלֵךְ) is the Bible’s standard metaphor for the course of a life. The adjective תָּמִים does not mean “flawless” in a modern, perfectionist sense; it is the word used of unblemished sacrificial animals and of human integrity. Noah is called “a righteous man, *blameless* (תָּמִים) in his generations” (Genesis 6:9), and Abraham is commanded, “Walk before Me and be blameless” (הִתְהַלֵּךְ לְפָנַי וֶהְיֵה תָמִים, Genesis 17:1). The term straddles ritual and ethics: an unblemished offering, a whole life.

The second phrase, “does what is right” (פֹּעֵל צֶדֶק), moves from character to action, especially in dealings with others. צֶדֶק in biblical Hebrew is not abstract “justice” so much as concrete rightness in relationships—fairness, honesty, reliability.

The third line tightens the circle: “speaks truth in his heart” (דֹבֵר אֱמֶת בִּלְבָבוֹ). Truth must be internal, not merely a public performance. As Rashi glosses, “The good that he says in his heart is true; he is not one thing in his mouth and another in his heart” (אינו אחד בפה ואחד בלב). The Talmud seizes on this line in a story about the sage Rav Safra, who silently agreed to a price in his mind; when the buyer later offered more, Rav Safra insisted on the first, unspoken figure, having already “spoken truth in his heart” (בבא בתרא 88א).

Already in verse 2, then, Psalm 15 is not opposing ethics to ritual; it is reframing the sacrificial requirement of תָּמִים as a human way of life: a “whole” walk, just deeds, and inner truth.

#### 3. Three circles of responsibility (vv. 3–4)

Verses 3 and 4 shift to a series of negations: “does not slander… does not do evil… does not carry reproach…” The Hebrew repeats לֹא (“not”) like fenceposts, building a boundary line around the righteous person’s conduct.

First comes speech:

> לֹא־רָגַל עַל־לְשׁוֹנוֹ  
> “He does not go about on his tongue.”

רָגַל is literally “to foot it,” to go about, and by extension “to spy” or “to slander.” BDB notes the Arabic parallel where “walk” words can also mean “slander.” Here the image is almost grotesque: the tongue becomes a foot that wanders from house to house carrying tales. This negative line directly balances the positive “speaks truth in his heart” in v. 2. The psalm sketches a small chiasm (an A–B–B′–A′ pattern): inner truth (heart) ↔ restrained speech (tongue); just deeds ↔ no harm to neighbor.

The social horizon then widens and deepens. The righteous person:

> לֹא־עָשָׂה לְרֵעֵהוּ רָעָה  
> “has not done evil to his neighbor,”  

and

> וְחֶרְפָּה לֹא־נָשָׂא עַל־קְרֹבוֹ׃  
> “has not lifted up reproach against his close relative.”

רֵעַ (“neighbor, companion”) is a broad term; קָרוֹב (“close one”) is the inner circle of kin. The psalmist insists that loyalty to family must not lead to injustice. Rashi, following this line, says that if a relative commits an offense, the righteous person punishes him “with justice and does not bear his reproach”—does not cover it up and so invite scandal (on v. 3). Malbim flips the angle: he refuses to injure a distant neighbor in order to benefit a relative.

At the same time, verse 4 disrupts the gravitational pull of blood ties by introducing a third circle:

> וְאֶת־יִרְאֵי יְהוָה יְכַבֵּד  
> “He honors those who fear the LORD.”

Here the primary community is not clan but shared reverence. The verb כִּבֵּד (“to honor”) literally means “to make heavy,” to treat as weighty. The righteous person publicly gives weight to the God-fearing—through esteem, support, and perhaps patronage.

The opening of v. 4 is notoriously hard:

> נִבְזֶה בְעֵינָיו נִמְאָס׃

Does this mean “The vile person is despised and rejected in his eyes” (Rashi), i.e., he refuses to flatter the wicked? Or, as Radak and Meiri read it, “Despised in his own eyes, he is rejected,” describing a self-effacing humility? Exactly this phrase is woven into a Rosh Hashanah piyyut, which speaks of God as “The Mighty One who does not despise, yet in His eyes the vile is despised” (כַּבִּיר לֹא יִמְאַס; לְנִבְזֶה בְעֵינָיו נִמְאָס). Liturgy here sides with Rashi’s more object-directed reading: the righteous, like God, must be allergic to baseness.

The verse ends with a bracing test:

> נִשְׁבַּע לְהָרַע וְלֹא יָמִר׃  
> “He swears to his own hurt and does not change.”

Literally, “he swears to do evil [to himself].” The rabbis hear this as self-disadvantage (לְהָרַע לְעַצְמוֹ, “to harm himself”), not malice toward others. In a culture that also warns sharply against rash oaths, Psalm 15 is making a narrower point: integrity means remaining bound by a commitment even when it becomes costly. Psalm 24, in parallel, speaks of one “who has not sworn deceitfully” (לֹא נִשְׁבַּע לְמִרְמָה, 24:4). Swearing lightly is dangerous; swearing and then wriggling out of it is intolerable.

#### 4. Money, justice, and the “bite” of interest (v. 5)

The last ethical tests move to money and the courts:

> כַּסְפּוֹ לֹא־נָתַן בְּנֶשֶׁךְ  
> “He has not given his money on interest,”  

> וְשֹׁחַד עַל־נָקִי לֹא־לָקָח׃  
> “and a bribe against the innocent he has not taken.”

נֶשֶׁךְ literally means “a bite.” The Torah repeatedly bans this practice within the covenant community: “You shall not give him your money on interest [בְּנֶשֶׁךְ], nor give him your food for profit” (Leviticus 25:37; cf. Exodus 22:24). Radak notes that even if the borrower “consents,” need makes that consent suspect; the interest payment is effectively taking what is not yours. The psalm assumes this legal background and presents the refusal to profit from another’s desperation as a condition for God’s fellowship.

שֹׁחַד (“bribe”) is equally corrosive. Rashi, citing *Sifrei*, stresses that the verse covers bribes taken even to acquit the innocent, not only to condemn; once a judge’s impartiality is purchased, justice itself has been sold.

The Torah Temimah quotes a passage from *Bava Metzia* (71a) that directly links this verse to the psalm’s conclusion. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: “Whoever has money and lends it without interest, about him Scripture says, ‘His money he has not given on interest… One who does these things shall not be shaken forever’ (עוֹשֵׂה אֵלֶּה לֹא יִמּוֹט לְעוֹלָם). From this you learn that whoever lends on interest, his possessions totter.” The rabbis read the vocabulary of “tottering” and “not being shaken” as a moral physics: the more you unsteady others’ lives, the more your own foundations give way.

#### 5. “Not shaken forever”: the promise (v. 5b)

The psalm closes:

> עֹשֵׂה־אֵלֶּה לֹא יִמּוֹט לְעוֹלָם׃  
> “One who does these things shall never be shaken.”

The verb מוֹט means to totter, slip, or be dislodged. It is a favorite metaphor in the Psalms for either downfall or security. “He alone is my rock and my salvation… I shall not be shaken” (לֹא אֶמּוֹט, Psalm 62:7); “The righteous will never be shaken” (צַדִּיק לְעוֹלָם בַּל־יִמּוֹט, Proverbs 10:30); “Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved” (לֹא יִמּוֹט לְעוֹלָם, Psalm 125:1).

Psalm 121, another pilgrim song, uses the same verb for God’s guarding of the traveler: “He will not let your foot be moved” (אַל־יִתֵּן לַמּוֹט רַגְלֶךָ, 121:3). Psalm 15 internalizes that protection: the one who lives this ethic *becomes* like an immovable mountain.

Rashi adds a realistic nuance: “If he falters, his faltering will not be forever; rather, he stumbles and rises.” The promise is not of sinless perfection, but of a life whose overall orientation is so aligned with God’s ways that it has a deep resilience.

#### 6. Psalm 15 as a miniature Torah

A famous Talmudic passage in *Makkot* 24a imagines a series of great figures successively “reducing” the 613 commandments to their core. David, it says, “came and established them on eleven,” and then it quotes Psalm 15 almost entire:

> מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד; יְהוָה מִי־יָגוּר בְּאָהֳלֶךָ… הוֹלֵךְ תָּמִים וּפֹעֵל צֶדֶק… כַּסְפּוֹ לֹא נָתַן בְּנֶשֶׁךְ וְשֹׁחַד עַל־נָקִי לֹא לָקָח; עֹשֵׂה אֵלֶּה לֹא יִמּוֹט לְעוֹלָם.

For the rabbis, Psalm 15 is not a rival to Torah or Temple but its distillation. It does not say, “Forget sacrifices”; it says, “If you wish to stand in the courts of the LORD, this is the kind of person you must be.” The psalm moves the focus from ritual performance alone to the whole fabric of speech, loyalty, economics, and self-knowledge.

In that sense, the psalm’s journey is from geography to character. It begins with the sacred tent and mountain, and ends by promising that a certain kind of person will share in their unshakeable stability. Holy space becomes, ultimately, a way of life.

#### Full psalm

In the *Edot ha-Mizrach* (Middle Eastern and North African) tradition, Psalm 15 is recited at the end of the seven-day *shiva* mourning period. As the mourners leave the tightly circumscribed world of the house of mourning and re-enter communal life, they chant:

> יְהוָה מִי־יָגוּר בְּאָהֳלֶךָ; מִי־יִשְׁכֹּן בְּהַר קׇדְשֶׁךָ׃  
> “LORD, who may sojourn in Your tent, who may dwell on Your holy mountain?”  

followed by the full description of the righteous and the closing promise,  

> עֹשֵׂה־אֵלֶּה לֹא יִמּוֹט לְעוֹלָם׃  
> “One who does these things shall never be shaken.”

In this setting the psalm is both eulogy and exhortation. It is implicitly applied to the deceased—may he or she be among those who “dwell on Your holy mountain”—and also offered as a moral compass to the living, who are reminded that the true measure of a life is integrity in speech, loyalty, and economic justice.

#### Phrases

Two phrases from verse 4 have taken on a life of their own in Ashkenazic liturgy.

1. **נִבְזֶה בְעֵינָיו נִמְאָס – “Despised in his eyes, rejected” (Psalm 15:4).**  
   In the Rosh Hashanah *Kerovot* (poetic expansions of the Amidah) for the *Kedushah*, a piyyut describes God’s judgment:

   > כַּבִּיר לֹא יִמְאַס; לְנִבְזֶה בְּעֵינָיו נִמְאָס.  

   “The Mighty One does not despise; yet in His eyes the vile is despised.”

   The psalm originally speaks of the righteous person despising baseness. The piyyut transfers the phrase to God, sharpening the tension between divine mercy (“does not despise”) and divine moral clarity (the truly vile are, in the end, rejected). The High Holiday context thus reads Psalm 15 as a window onto God’s own character.

2. **וְאֶת־יִרְאֵי יְהוָה יְכַבֵּד – “He honors those who fear the LORD” (Psalm 15:4).**  
   A later liturgical poem, recited in some Ashkenazi rites on the eve of Yom Kippur and in Sefardic rites after the Shabbat Musaf, reworks the line into a communal call to praise:

   > בֵּית יִשְׂרָאֵל וְיִרְאֵי יְהוָה, יְכַבְּדוּ וְיוֹדוּ שִׁמְךָ יְהוָה.  

   “The house of Israel and those who fear the LORD will honor and thank Your name, O LORD.”

   What was in the psalm a trait of the righteous individual—he honors the God-fearing—becomes in the liturgy the collective task of Israel and all “God-fearers”: to honor God Himself. The ethical stance of Psalm 15 thus flows outward into worship; honoring those who fear God becomes inseparable from honoring God’s name.
