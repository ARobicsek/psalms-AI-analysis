## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (8)

1. What is the specific semantic range of Hebrew 'ragash' (assemble/rage) in v. 1 and how does it differ from other terms for political uprising?
2. How does the phrase 'today I have begotten you' (v. 7) function in ancient Near Eastern adoption formulas, and what are its implications for Christological interpretation?
3. What is the significance of the metaphor of 'breaking cords' and 'casting off ropes' (v. 3) in ancient political contexts?
4. How do the violent imagery of the 'iron mace' and 'potter's ware' (v. 9) relate to ancient Near Eastern conquest metaphors?
5. What is the textual and interpretive problem with 'kiss the son' (nashqu-bar) in v. 12, and how do ancient versions resolve it?
6. How does the geographic specificity of 'Zion, my holy mountain' (v. 6) function in the psalm's universal claims?
7. What is the relationship between this psalm's royal ideology and other Davidic covenant texts (2 Samuel 7, Psalm 89)?
8. How does the wisdom vocabulary in vv. 10-12 ('be prudent,' 'accept discipline') connect this psalm to sapiential literature?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (8)

1. Why does the psalm use the rare verb 'ragash' for national assembly - does it inherently imply futile agitation?
2. What is the significance of the textual problem 'nashqu-bar' in v.12 - scribal error or intentional Aramaic?
3. How does the conditional offer 'ask of me' (v.8) relate to the declared accomplished fact 'I have installed' (v.6)?
4. Why does divine response progress from laughter to anger to declaration - what triggers each emotional shift?
5. What is the function of the paradoxical 'rejoice with trembling' formulation in v.11?
6. How does the 'shepherd with iron rod' metaphor work - pastoral care or ironic destruction?
7. Why shift from cosmic universal claims to specific geographic 'Zion' localization?
8. What is the relationship between the wisdom vocabulary (vv.10-11) and the violent imagery (v.9)?
