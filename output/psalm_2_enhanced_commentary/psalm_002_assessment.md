# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 2

What works: The draft recognizes Psalm 2 as a drama in four movements and keeps the reader’s eye on both the politics and the poetics. It rightly tracks the speakers, notes the anthropomorphic “laughter,” and catches the paradox of “rejoicing with trembling.” It brings traditional Jewish commentators into the conversation and is alert to the psalm’s final beatitude as a bookend to Psalm 1.

What needs work: The prose sometimes leans on assertion more than demonstration. Sound and structure are mentioned, but the analysis rarely uses the phonetic data supplied or exploits the poetry’s parallelism and rhetorical pivots (“A is so, and what’s more, B,” i.e., how the second colon advances the first). A few lexical points are glossed too quickly (e.g., verse 10’s “hivvasru” is best from the discipline root y-s-r rather than s-w-r), and a major variant (LXX’s “you shall shepherd” in v. 9) deserves more than a footnote; it shapes interpretation across Jewish and Christian traditions. The commentary notes the crux of “nashqu-bar” (v. 12) but does not trace how the LXX’s “seize instruction” may reflect a different Hebrew Vorlage and sharpen the psalm’s didactic turn.

Missed opportunities (and fixable with the provided research): 
- Verse 1’s rare `ragash` and the irony that the same verb “meditate” (`haga`) describes the rebels’ plotting (2:1) and the righteous person’s Torah meditation (1:2).
- Verse 3’s cords/yoke metaphor should be set beside Jeremiah 2:20 and 30:8 to show a recurring biblical figure for rejecting rightful rule.
- Verse 4’s divine laughter should be compared with Psalm 37:13 and 59:8.
- Verse 5’s terror verb (`bhl`) has strong parallels in Exodus 23:27; Deuteronomy 7:23.
- Verse 9’s LXX “shepherd with an iron rod” (poimaino) and the pottery metaphor’s wider biblical pattern (Jeremiah 19:11; Isaiah 30:14) and later reception (Revelation 2:27; 12:5; 19:15).
- Verse 12’s “perish from the way” links to Psalm 1:6 and completes the doorway inclusio.

Figurative language: The draft notes images but too vaguely. It must cite specific parallels (book:chapter:verse), comment on usage patterns, and explain how Psalm 2’s usage is distinctive. Finally, define terms (LXX, MT, colon, merism, inclusio, Hithpael, jussive) briefly in-line for lay readers. The revision below addresses these points.
