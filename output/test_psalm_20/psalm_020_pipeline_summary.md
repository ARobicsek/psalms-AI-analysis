## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (10)

1. What is the theological significance of the progression from 'God of Jacob' to 'YHWH our God' in the divine epithets?
2. How do the specific sacrifice terms (מנחות, עולה) function in pre-battle ritual contexts, and what does ידשנה suggest about divine acceptance?
3. What is the precise meaning and theological import of משיחו ('His anointed') in this military context versus other royal psalm usages?
4. How do the spatial relationships (sanctuary/Zion/heavenly sanctuary) reflect ancient Israelite cosmology and temple theology?
5. What are the syntactic and semantic implications of the jussive mood pattern for understanding ancient Hebrew liturgical language?
6. How does the 'Now I know' formula in v. 7 function as a prophetic or ritual declaration, and who is the likely speaker?
7. What is the significance of the ambiguous referent for 'the King' in v. 10 - human king, YHWH as king, or both?
8. How does the chariots/horses imagery relate to other biblical critiques of military confidence (cf. Isa 31:1, Ps 33:17)?
9. What does the contrast between 'falling' and 'standing firm' suggest about the psalm's understanding of divine warfare?
10. How does this psalm's theology of divine name relate to broader ANE concepts of divine presence and power?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (7)

1. Why does the psalm use 'God of Jacob' rather than 'God of Israel' in the opening petition?
2. What triggers the sudden confidence shift at 'Now I know' in verse 7 - ritual sign, prophetic word, or liturgical convention?
3. Is the missing verb in 'These [trust] in chariots' (v.8) deliberate ellipsis to emphasize the contrast?
4. Does the final verse's 'the King' deliberately create ambiguity between human and divine kingship?
5. How does the rare verb יְדַשְּׁנֶ֣ה (make fat/rich) function in sacrificial acceptance terminology?
6. What is the significance of the spatial progression from sanctuary to Zion to heavenly sanctuary?
7. Why does the psalm return to petition mode in v.10 after expressing such confidence in vv.7-9?
