# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 20

This draft has real strengths: it rightly identifies the psalm’s central contrast between human armament and divine aid “in the name” of YHWH; it attends to the liturgical setting (vv. 3–4), the rhetorical pivot at “Now I know” (v. 7), and the closing ambiguity of “the king” (v. 10). It draws accurate links to lexicon entries (especially נַזְכִּיר and יְדַשְּׁנֶה) and notes the inclusio around the verb “answer” (vv. 2, 10). The sound of the Hebrew is noticed, and the commentary uses traditional sources judiciously.

Several weaknesses should be corrected. Stylistically, the introduction is breathless and over-claims novelty (“theological manifesto”), where the psalm’s artistry and argument can be shown rather than proclaimed. A few technical slips need repair: in v. 5 “kol appears twice” is incorrect—כִּלְבָבֶךָ begins with the preposition כ (according to), not כֹּל (all). The stem discussion in v. 2 should avoid confident labeling; what matters is the causative sense “set you on high.” The discussion of banners (v. 6) underuses the LXX’s megalynō, which many have taken as evidence for a different reading (נַגְדִּיל/נַגְבִּיר). The draft could also draw more explicitly on the figurative-language parallels: Prov 18:10 (“the name of YHWH is a strong tower”), Ps 118:10–12; 124:8; Exod 17:15; Ps 60:6; Deut 20:1; Ps 33:17; Isa 31:1; Ps 147:10—showing how Psalm 20 both participates in and sharpens these patterns.

Missed questions that can be answered with the bundle: the function of the “God of Jacob” epithet (with its distribution in Psalms), the uniqueness of מִשְּׁמֵי קׇדְשׁוֹ (v. 7), the rhetorical and structural effect of the shifting speakers, and the scope of the “answer”-inclusio. The verse-by-verse sections can also benefit from a clearer account of parallelism and ellipsis (define both), a more restrained account of Selah, and short notes on MT-LXX differences where they illuminate the line.

The revisions below aim for measured prose, fuller engagement with Hebrew poetics, explicit cross-references, and precise, accessible explanation of technical points.
