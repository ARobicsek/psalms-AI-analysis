## Introduction

# Psalm 20: The Liturgical Transformation of Royal Confidence

The ancient temple courts of Jerusalem would have echoed with many pre-battle prayers, but few possess the theological sophistication of Psalm 20. At first glance, the psalm appears straightforward: a communal liturgy seeking divine protection for the king before military engagement. Yet beneath this conventional surface lies a remarkable theological argument about the nature of divine kingship and the source of true military strength.

The psalm's central insight emerges through a careful orchestration of verbal moods that traces a journey from uncertainty to confident declaration. The opening verses (2-5) cascade with jussive forms—*yeʿankha* ("may he answer you"), *yišlaḥ* ("may he send"), *yizkōr* ("may he remember")—creating the rhythmic petition typical of pre-battle liturgy. But this liturgical momentum builds toward a pivotal transformation in verse 7: *ʿatta yādaʿtî* ("now I know"). The shift from uncertain petition to accomplished fact signals more than ritual progression; it represents a theological revolution in the very concept of military confidence.

This verbal transformation reveals the psalm's deeper argument. The poet systematically contrasts two competing sources of security: conventional military might versus covenant faithfulness. The stark antithesis of verse 8 crystallizes this tension: "Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God" (*ēlleh bāreket wĕēlleh bassūsîm waʾănaḥnû bĕšēm-YHWH ʾĕlōhênû nazkîr*). The parallel construction emphasizes the choice every military leader faces: rely on visible, tangible power or on the invisible covenant relationship with Israel's God.

The Hebrew lexicon reveals the theological precision of this contrast. The term *šēm* (name), appearing three times in the psalm, carries far more weight than simple designation. As BDB notes, *šēm* in divine contexts embodies "the (revealed) character of YHWH," representing not merely God's reputation but his essential nature and covenant reliability. When the psalmist declares confidence in God's *šēm*, he invokes the entire history of divine faithfulness to Israel. This stands in deliberate opposition to the tangible military resources—chariots (*rekeb*) and horses (*sūs*)—that surrounding nations trusted.

The psalm's sophisticated use of divine epithets further develops this theological argument. The progression from *YHWH* (verse 2) to *ʾĕlōhê yaʿăqōb* ("God of Jacob," verse 2) to *ʾĕlōhênû* ("our God," verse 8) traces a movement from the universal divine name through Israel's particular covenant history to intimate personal relationship. The epithet "God of Jacob" proves especially significant, evoking not the idealized patriarch but Jacob the deceiver, the one who struggled with both men and God. This choice suggests that divine kingship operates not through moral perfection but through covenant relationship with a people who, like their ancestor, know both failure and divine grace.

The psalm's structural architecture reinforces its theological message through careful use of inclusio. The motif of divine "answering" (*ʿānâ*) frames the composition, appearing in the opening petition (*yeʿankha*, verse 2) and the closing appeal (*yaʿănēnû*, verse 10). This framing device suggests that the entire liturgical journey—from petition through confident declaration to final appeal—occurs within the sphere of divine responsiveness. God is not distant or unengaged but actively present throughout the military enterprise.

Yet the psalm's final verse introduces a fascinating theological ambiguity that has puzzled interpreters. The closing petition, "O LORD, save! May the king answer us in the day we call" (*YHWH hôšîʿâ hammelek yaʿănēnû bĕyôm qārĕʾēnû*), blurs the distinction between divine and royal authority. Does "the king" refer to the earthly monarch or to YHWH as divine king? The Hebrew syntax permits both readings, and this ambiguity appears deliberate rather than accidental. The psalm concludes by suggesting that in Israel's ideal polity, the distinction between divine and human kingship should become nearly invisible—not because the human king assumes divine prerogatives, but because divine authority operates through human covenant faithfulness.

This theological vision places Psalm 20 within a broader Ancient Near Eastern discussion about the relationship between gods and kings in warfare. Mesopotamian royal inscriptions regularly credit military victories to divine intervention, but they typically emphasize the king's ritual correctness or personal piety as securing divine favor. The Psalm 20 poet reverses this dynamic. Here, divine intervention flows not from royal virtue but from covenant relationship—the same covenant available to the entire community, not just its leadership.

The psalm's liturgical setting reinforces this democratic theology. The repeated first-person plural forms ("we remember," "we trust," "our God") emphasize that this is communal prayer, not royal petition. The king appears as object of intercession rather than subject of prayer, suggesting a model of kingship accountable to community covenant relationship rather than autonomous in its exercise of power.

Modern readers might find the psalm's military context troubling, but its theological argument transcends its historical setting. By locating true security in covenant relationship rather than military superiority, the psalm critiques any political arrangement that trusts ultimate authority to force rather than faithfulness. The poet's vision of divine kingship operating through human covenantal community offers an alternative to both ancient despotism and modern militarism.

The psalm's enduring power lies not in its endorsement of particular military ventures but in its insistence that all human authority—political, military, or religious—must finally answer to the covenant-making, covenant-keeping God of Israel. In a world still tempted to trust in chariots and horses, Psalm 20 continues to call its readers toward a different kind of confidence: the assurance that comes not from superior firepower but from faithful relationship with the One whose voice can shatter cedars and still waters, who reigns not through domination but through the patient work of blessing.

## Verse-by-Verse Commentary

### Verse 1

**Hebrew:** לַמְנַצֵּ֗חַ מִזְמ֥וֹר לְדָוִֽד׃

**English:** For the leader. A psalm of David.

לַמְנַצֵּחַ מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד
*For the director. A psalm of David.*

The superscription employs the enigmatic term לַמְנַצֵּחַ (*lamnaṣṣēaḥ*), found in 55 psalm titles. While traditionally rendered "to the choirmaster," the BDB lexicon suggests it indicates these psalms derived from "an older major Psalter known as the Director's Collection." The root נצח carries meanings of "endure" and "be pre-eminent," leading some scholars to interpret this as "for enduring performance" rather than mere musical direction. The Septuagint's εἰς τὸ τέλος ("unto the end") reflects an eschatological understanding that influenced patristic interpretation.

The attribution לְדָוִד presents the familiar interpretive crux: authorship, dedication, or collection marker? The preposition לְ allows all three possibilities. Given the psalm's military context and royal imagery, Davidic authorship remains plausible, though many scholars favor a later composition using Davidic idiom. The term מִזְמוֹר (from זמר, "to sing/play") specifically denotes a song with instrumental accompaniment, distinguishing it from שִׁיר (song) or תְּהִלָּה (praise). This technical designation supports the liturgical function suggested by the macro analysis, indicating this psalm was composed for formal temple worship rather than private devotion. The superscription thus frames what follows as authoritative Davidic tradition preserved for ongoing liturgical use in Israel's pre-battle rituals.

### Verse 2

**Hebrew:** יַֽעַנְךָ֣ ה׳ בְּי֣וֹם צָרָ֑ה יְ֝שַׂגֶּבְךָ֗ שֵׁ֤ם ׀ אֱלֹקֵ֬י יַעֲקֹֽב׃

**English:** May the LORD answer you in time of trouble,the name of Jacob’s God keep you safe.

יַעַנְךָ ה׳ בְּיוֹם צָרָה יְשַׂגֶּבְךָ שֵׁם אֱלֹקֵי יַעֲקֹב
*May YHWH answer you in the day of trouble; may the name of the God of Jacob set you on high.*

The verse opens with יַעַנְךָ, a jussive form expressing petition rather than confident assertion. The root ענה ("answer") appears throughout Hebrew prayers, often describing divine response to distress (cf. Ps 4:1, 69:17). The phrase יוֹם צָרָה ("day of trouble") employs צָרָה, which can denote both military crisis and general distress—its military connotation here is supported by the psalm's context of battle preparation.

The second colon introduces a striking theological concept: שֵׁם אֱלֹקֵי יַעֲקֹב ("the name of the God of Jacob") as active agent. In Hebrew theology, the divine "name" (שֵׁם) represents God's revealed character and active presence (cf. Ex 3:14-15, 20:24). The verb יְשַׂגֶּבְךָ (Piel imperfect from שׂגב) means "set securely on high," often used of divine protection placing someone beyond enemy reach (cf. Ps 91:14, 107:41).

The specific designation "God of Jacob" rather than "God of Israel" merits attention. Jacob represents the struggling, not-yet-transformed patriarch, making this epithet particularly appropriate for moments of crisis. The Septuagint preserves this reading, though some manuscripts show textual variants. This divine name appears in concentrated fashion throughout Psalms 20-21, suggesting liturgical pairing. The parallelism here is synthetic rather than synonymous—the second line builds upon the first by specifying the means (divine name/presence) through which YHWH's answer comes.

### Verse 3

**Hebrew:** יִשְׁלַֽח־עֶזְרְךָ֥ מִקֹּ֑דֶשׁ וּ֝מִצִּיּ֗וֹן יִסְעָדֶֽךָּ׃

**English:** May He send you help from the sanctuary,and sustain you from Zion.

יִשְׁלַח עֶזְרְךָ מִקֹּדֶשׁ וּמִצִּיּוֹן יִסְעָדֶךָּ
*May he send your help from the sanctuary and from Zion support you.*

This verse establishes the crucial spatial theology underlying the psalm's petition. The verb יִשְׁלַח (Qal imperfect, "may he send") suggests active divine intervention rather than passive blessing. עֶזְרְךָ ("your help") appears frequently in military contexts, denoting both human and divine assistance (cf. Ps 33:20, 70:1).

The prepositional phrases מִקֹּדֶשׁ ("from the sanctuary") and מִצִּיּוֹן ("from Zion") present interpretive challenges. Does מִקֹּדֶשׁ refer to the earthly temple sanctuary or God's heavenly dwelling? The parallel with "Zion" suggests earthly reference, yet other psalms use קֹדֶשׁ for divine habitation (cf. Ps 68:6). The absence of the definite article with קֹדֶשׁ might support the heavenly interpretation, though Hebrew poetry often omits articles.

יִסְעָדֶךָּ (from סעד) means "support, sustain," often with connotations of strengthening for continued action rather than merely protecting from harm. The root appears in contexts of providing food (Ps 104:15) and upholding the weak (Ps 94:18), suggesting comprehensive support.

The theological geography here reflects ancient Near Eastern concepts of divine presence concentrated in sacred spaces. Mesopotamian parallels show gods sending aid "from their dwelling place" to favored kings. However, the Hebrew formulation emphasizes YHWH's choice to dwell in Zion specifically, making Jerusalem the cosmic center from which divine power emanates. This spatial theology would prove crucial during the exile when the physical sanctuary was destroyed but the theological principle endured.

### Verse 4

**Hebrew:** יִזְכֹּ֥ר כׇּל־מִנְחֹתֶ֑ךָ וְעוֹלָתְךָ֖ יְדַשְּׁנֶ֣ה סֶֽלָה׃

**English:** May He receive the tokensaReference to azkara, “token portion” of meal offering; Lev. 2.2, 9, 16, etc. of all your meal offerings,and approvebMeaning of Heb. uncertain. your burnt offerings. Selah.

יִזְכֹּר כָּל־מִנְחֹתֶיךָ וְעוֹלָתְךָ יְדַשְּׁנֶה־סֶלָה
*May he remember all your grain offerings, and may he accept your burnt offering as fat. Selah.*

The sacrificial terminology here reflects Israel's formal worship system. יִזְכֹּר ("may he remember") employs זכר in its covenantal sense—not merely recalling but acting favorably based on memory (cf. Gen 8:1, Ex 2:24). מִנְחֹתֶיךָ (plural "your grain offerings") uses the general term מִנְחָה, which in pre-exilic texts could denote any offering but later became specific to cereal offerings (Lev 2).

וְעוֹלָתְךָ ("your burnt offering") represents the most complete sacrificial act, where the entire animal was consumed on the altar. The singular form contrasts with the plural "grain offerings," perhaps suggesting one major burnt offering accompanied by multiple supporting offerings—typical of royal liturgical practice.

יְדַשְּׁנֶה presents textual-interpretive complexity. The verb דשׁן typically means "make fat," but fat offerings were considered especially acceptable to God (cf. Gen 4:4). The Piel form here likely means "regard as fat/acceptable" rather than literally "make fat." Some manuscripts read יְדַשְּׁנֶהָ with feminine suffix agreeing with עֹלָה, while others support the current masculine form. The LXX's πυρώσαι ("set on fire") suggests a different vocalization or understanding.

The liturgical marker סֶלָה appears 71 times in Psalms, possibly indicating a musical pause or crescendo. Its placement here after sacrificial references might mark a moment for the actual offering ritual to occur during liturgical performance.

Archaeological evidence from ancient Israel shows grain and burnt offerings were indeed combined in temple worship, supporting this psalm's reflection of authentic cultic practice rather than merely literary convention.

### Verse 5

**Hebrew:** יִֽתֶּן־לְךָ֥ כִלְבָבֶ֑ךָ וְֽכׇל־עֲצָתְךָ֥ יְמַלֵּֽא׃

**English:** May He grant you your desire,and fulfill your every plan.

יִתֶּן־לְךָ כִלְבָבֶךָ וְכָל־עֲצָתְךָ יְמַלֵּא
*May he give to you according to your heart and fulfill all your counsel.*

The verse shifts from ritual acts to inner desires and planning. יִתֶּן־לְךָ ("may he give to you") uses the basic verb נתן but in a context suggesting granting of requests rather than simple giving. כִלְבָבֶךָ ("according to your heart") employs the preposition כְּ ("according to, as") with לֵבָב, the fuller form of "heart" that often emphasizes the inner person's totality—mind, will, and emotion.

The phrase וְכָל־עֲצָתְךָ יְמַלֵּא ("and all your counsel may he fulfill") uses עֵצָה, which ranges from advice to plan to purpose. In military contexts, עֵצָה often denotes strategic planning (cf. 2 Sam 17:7, Prov 20:18). The verb מלא ("fulfill/fill") in the Piel suggests complete realization rather than partial success.

This parallelism creates tension between spontaneous desire ("heart") and deliberate planning ("counsel"). Hebrew anthropology doesn't sharply separate emotion and reason as Greek thought does—the "heart" includes rational planning while "counsel" can involve passionate commitment. The verse thus petitions for success in both impulsive and calculated aspects of royal decision-making.

Comparative analysis reveals similar ancient Near Eastern prayers for royal success. Mesopotamian texts show gods granting kings "the desire of their heart" and "fulfilling their plans." However, the Hebrew formulation assumes the king's desires align with divine will—a presumption requiring the covenantal relationship implied throughout the psalm.

The theological implication is striking: God grants requests that emerge from hearts aligned with divine purposes and fulfills plans conceived in accordance with divine counsel. This reciprocal relationship between human planning and divine sovereignty reflects mature covenant theology.

### Verse 6

**Hebrew:** נְרַנְּנָ֤ה ׀ בִּ֘ישׁ֤וּעָתֶ֗ךָ וּבְשֵֽׁם־אֱלֹקֵ֥ינוּ נִדְגֹּ֑ל יְמַלֵּ֥א ה׳ כׇּל־מִשְׁאֲלוֹתֶֽיךָ׃

**English:** May we shout for joy in your victory,arrayed by standards in the name of our God.May the LORD fulfill your every wish.

נְרַנְּנָה בִּישׁוּעָתֶךָ וּבְשֵׁם־אֱלֹקֵינוּ נִדְגֹּל נְמַלֵּא ה׳ כָּל־מִשְׁאֲלוֹתֶיךָ
*We will shout for joy at your salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up banners. May YHWH fulfill all your petitions.*

This verse dramatically shifts from petition to anticipated celebration, employing cohortative forms expressing determined intention. נְרַנְּנָה (from רנן, "shout joyfully") appears throughout Hebrew liturgy for exuberant worship (cf. Ps 33:1, 95:1). The root suggests a ringing, musical cry often associated with victory celebrations.

בִּישׁוּעָתֶךָ ("at your salvation") uses יְשׁוּעָה, which encompasses deliverance, victory, and welfare. The term's military connotations are clear in contexts like Ps 18:50, though it can extend to general divine blessing. The possessive suffix ("your salvation") indicates the community celebrates the king's victory as their own benefit.

וּבְשֵׁם־אֱלֹקֵינוּ נִדְגֹּל presents textual challenges. נִדְגֹּל appears only here and in Cant 6:4, 10, apparently from דגל ("banner/standard"). The LXX's μεγαλυνθησόμεθα ("we shall be magnified") suggests they read differently, perhaps נַגְדִּיל ("we shall grow great"). However, military banners make excellent sense in this context—victory celebrations typically involved raising standards (cf. Ps 60:4).

The phrase אֱלֹקֵינוּ ("our God") subtly shifts from previous divine epithets, emphasizing communal relationship rather than ancestral connection ("God of Jacob") or royal prerogative. This inclusive language reinforces that royal victory benefits the entire covenant community.

נְמַלֵּא־ה׳ כָּל־מִשְׁאֲלוֹתֶיךָ concludes with a final petition using מלא again (cf. v. 5) and מִשְׁאֲלוֹת ("requests/petitions"), which often appears in contexts of asking God for specific needs (cf. Ps 37:4, 1 Kgs 2:20).

### Verse 7

**Hebrew:** עַתָּ֤ה יָדַ֗עְתִּי כִּ֤י הוֹשִׁ֥יעַ ׀ ה׳ מְשִׁ֫יח֥וֹ יַ֭עֲנֵהוּ מִשְּׁמֵ֣י קׇדְשׁ֑וֹ בִּ֝גְבֻר֗וֹת יֵ֣שַׁע יְמִינֽוֹ׃

**English:** Now I know that the LORD will give victory to His anointed,will answer him from His heavenly sanctuarywith the mighty victories of His right arm.

עַתָּה יָדַעְתִּי כִּי הוֹשִׁיעַ ה׳ מְשִׁיחוֹ יַעֲנֵהוּ מִשְּׁמֵי קָדְשׁוֹ בִּגְבֻרוֹת יֵשַׁע יְמִינוֹ
*Now I know that YHWH has delivered his anointed one; he answers him from his holy heavens with the mighty victories of his right hand.*

This verse marks the psalm's crucial pivot point with עַתָּה יָדַעְתִּי ("now I know"), shifting from petition to confident declaration. The phrase appears at moments of divine revelation or certainty (cf. Gen 22:12, Ex 18:11). The perfect verb יָדַעְתִּי suggests completed knowledge, implying either prophetic revelation during the ritual or confident faith anticipating divine response.

כִּי הוֹשִׁיעַ introduces the grounds for certainty. הוֹשִׁיעַ (Hiphil perfect from ישׁע) means "has delivered/saved," employing the same root as יְשׁוּעָה in verse 6. The perfect aspect suggests completed action from the speaker's perspective, though the deliverance may be future from the narrative standpoint.

מְשִׁיחוֹ ("his anointed one") is theologically loaded. מָשִׁיחַ literally means "anointed one," referring primarily to Israel's kings who were consecrated with oil (cf. 1 Sam 16:13, 2 Sam 23:1). The term appears 39 times in Hebrew Scripture, often with possessive suffixes referring to God's relationship with the anointed king. Later Jewish and Christian interpretation would see messianic significance, but the original context clearly indicates the contemporary Davidic monarch.

מִשְּׁמֵי קָדְשׁוֹ ("from his holy heavens") resolves the ambiguity of verse 3's מִקֹּדֶשׁ by clearly indicating heavenly sanctuary. שְׁמֵי קָדְשׁוֹ appears only here, combining שָׁמַיִם ("heavens") with the construct form of קֹדֶשׁ ("holiness"). This unique formulation emphasizes both transcendence and sanctity of the divine dwelling.

בִּגְבֻרוֹת יֵשַׁע יְמִינוֹ ("with mighty victories of his right hand") employs intensive plural גְּבוּרוֹת ("mighty deeds") combined with יֵשַׁע ("salvation/victory") and יָמִין ("right hand"). The divine right hand symbolizes power and action throughout Hebrew literature (cf. Ex 15:6, Ps 98:1). This combination creates a crescendo of divine power terminology culminating the psalm's movement from petition to confidence.

### Verse 8

**Hebrew:** אֵ֣לֶּה בָ֭רֶכֶב וְאֵ֣לֶּה בַסּוּסִ֑ים וַאֲנַ֓חְנוּ ׀ בְּשֵׁם־ה׳ אֱלֹקֵ֣ינוּ נַזְכִּֽיר׃

**English:** They [call] on chariots, they [call] on horses,but we call on the name of the LORD our God.

אֵלֶּה בָרֶכֶב וְאֵלֶּה בַסּוּסִים וַאֲנַחְנוּ בְּשֵׁם־ה׳ אֱלֹקֵינוּ נַזְכִּיר
*Some [trust] in chariots and some in horses, but we will invoke the name of YHWH our God.*

This verse presents the psalm's starkest antithesis through demonstrative pronouns אֵלֶּה...אֵלֶּה ("these...these") contrasted with אֲנַחְנוּ ("we"). The structure creates clear binary opposition between conventional military trust and theological confidence. While most translations supply "trust," the Hebrew verb is implied rather than explicit, heightening the contrast's rhetorical force.

בָרֶכֶב וְאֵלֶּה בַסּוּסִים ("in chariots...in horses") lists ancient warfare's premier technologies. רֶכֶב represents chariotry—mobile platforms providing tactical advantage and psychological intimidation. Horses (סוּסִים) were primarily military assets in ancient Israel, associated with royal power and foreign influence (cf. Deut 17:16, 1 Kgs 10:26). These innovations transformed Near Eastern warfare, making traditional infantry tactics obsolete.

Archaeological evidence confirms chariots and cavalry dominated military thinking in Iron Age Palestine. Egyptian reliefs show massive chariot forces, while Assyrian inscriptions boast of captured horses and vehicles. Israel's adoption of these technologies marked accommodation to international military standards, yet tension with traditional covenantal ideology persisted.

וַאֲנַחְנוּ בְּשֵׁם־ה׳ אֱלֹקֵינוּ נַזְכִּיר provides the theological alternative. נַזְכִּיר (Hiphil from זכר) means "invoke/proclaim/remember" rather than simply "mention." The term carries liturgical connotations of calling upon divine name in worship and petition (cf. Ps 45:18, Is 26:13). This isn't mere verbal formula but active engagement with divine presence through revealed name.

שֵׁם־ה׳ אֱלֹקֵינוּ combines the covenant name YHWH with the more general אֱלֹקִים, suggesting both intimate relationship and sovereign power. This divine name-title formula appears throughout Deuteronomistic literature, emphasizing both transcendence and accessibility of Israel's God. The verse thus contrasts tangible military assets with intangible but ultimately more reliable divine relationship.

### Verse 9

**Hebrew:** הֵ֭מָּה כָּרְע֣וּ וְנָפָ֑לוּ וַאֲנַ֥חְנוּ קַּ֝֗מְנוּ וַנִּתְעוֹדָֽד׃

**English:** They collapse and lie fallen,but we rally and gather strength.

הֵמָּה כָּרְעוּ וְנָפָלוּ וַאֲנַחְנוּ קַּמְנוּ וַנִּתְעוֹדָד
*They have bowed down and fallen, but we have risen and stand firm.*

The verse completes the antithetical structure begun in verse 8 through perfect verbs describing completed action. הֵמָּה כָּרְעוּ וְנָפָלוּ ("they have bowed down and fallen") uses two verbs in devastating sequence. כָּרְעוּ (from כרע) means "bow down," often describing worship (cf. Ps 95:6) but here indicating collapse in defeat. The military sense appears in passages like Judges 5:27, where Sisera "bowed, fell, lay" in death.

וְנָפָלוּ (from נפל) typically means "fall," whether in battle, worship, or physical collapse. The combination כרע ונפל appears elsewhere describing military defeat (cf. 2 Kgs 9:24, Is 10:4). The perfect verbs suggest completed action from the prophetic perspective—enemies are as good as defeated because divine intervention is certain.

וַאֲנַחְנוּ קַּמְנוּ וַנִּתְעוֹדָד presents the contrasting destiny through emphatic personal pronoun אֲנַחְנוּ and two verbs of recovery. קַּמְנוּ (from קום) means "we have risen," often with connotations of recovery, establishment, or victorious standing. The verb frequently appears in contexts of rising after defeat or establishing authority (cf. Ps 18:39, 2 Sam 23:10).

וַנִּתְעוֹדָד (Hithpolel from עוד) presents interpretive challenges. This rare form appears only here and possibly in related passages. The root עוד can mean "return" or "do again," but the intensive Hithpolel form suggests "be restored" or "recover strength." The LXX's ἀνωρθώθημεν ("we were set upright") supports this interpretation. Some scholars emend to וַנִּתְיַצָּב ("stand firm"), but the MT reading makes good sense as "we are restored/strengthened."

The perfect verbs throughout this verse create dramatic closure to the antithetical comparison. Those trusting military power experience complete collapse, while those trusting YHWH experience complete restoration. This theological perspective transforms military conflict into spiritual warfare where outcome depends on covenant relationship rather than technological superiority.

### Verse 10

**Hebrew:** ה׳ הוֹשִׁ֑יעָה הַ֝מֶּ֗לֶךְ יַעֲנֵ֥נוּ בְיוֹם־קׇרְאֵֽנוּ׃ {פ}

**English:** cOr in the light of v. 7, “O Lord, grant victory to the king; may He answer us when we call.”O LORD, grant victory!May the King answer us when we call.-c

ה׳ הוֹשִׁיעָה הַמֶּלֶךְ יַעֲנֵנוּ בְיוֹם־קָרְאֵנוּ
*YHWH, save the king! May he answer us in the day we call.*

The psalm concludes with direct petition returning to the opening's supplicatory mood. ה׳ הוֹשִׁיעָה employs the imperative form of ישׁע, creating urgency absent from earlier jussive constructions. הוֹשִׁיעָה (Hiphil imperative with cohortative ה) intensifies the plea for immediate divine action.

הַמֶּלֶךְ ("the king") appears with definite article, emphasizing the specific royal figure central to Israel's welfare. This direct reference contrasts with earlier indirect address ("you") and demonstrates the psalm's communal perspective—the people petition for their king's success because their own security depends on his victory.

The final colon יַעֲנֵנוּ בְיוֹם־קָרְאֵנוּ ("may he answer us in the day we call") creates inclusio with verse 2's יַעַנְךָ...בְּיוֹם צָרָה. Both verses use ענה ("answer") and יוֹם ("day") with temporal circumstance, but the perspective shifts from royal need to communal calling. The plural suffix on יַעֲנֵנוּ ("answer us") and קָרְאֵנוּ ("we call") emphasizes collective involvement.

However, textual ambiguity exists regarding the imperative's scope. Does יַעֲנֵנוּ continue the address to YHWH ("may YHWH answer us") or shift to the king as subject ("may the king answer us")? Hebrew syntax allows both readings. The theological interpretation sees continued divine address, while some political readings suggest royal responsiveness to popular needs. The former interpretation better fits the psalm's consistent focus on divine agency.

בְיוֹם־קָרְאֵנוּ ("in the day we call") uses the temporal formula found throughout psalmic literature for moments of crisis requiring divine intervention (cf. Ps 50:15, 86:7, 91:15). The phrase assumes ongoing relationship where calling upon God produces reliable response—a covenantal confidence running throughout the psalm's progression from petition through confidence to renewed supplication.
