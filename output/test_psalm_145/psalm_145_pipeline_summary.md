## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (10)

1. How does the possible missing nun verse affect interpretation of the psalm's acrostic structure and theological completeness?
2. What is the significance of the Ugaritic parallel in v. 13 for understanding Israelite royal theology and divine kingship?
3. How does the frequent use of כל (all/every) function rhetorically to build the psalm's universalist vision?
4. What specific Hebrew terminology is used for divine 'works' (מַעֲשֶׂיךָ) versus 'mighty acts' (גְּבוּרֹתֶיךָ) and how do these categories function theologically?
5. How does the generational language (דּ֣וֹר לְ֭דוֹר) relate to covenant theology and the transmission of faith?
6. What is the relationship between divine transcendence (vv. 3, 11-13) and immanent care (vv. 14-20) in the psalm's theological structure?
7. How does the movement from 'I will bless' to 'all creatures shall bless' function as a model for expanding worship participation?
8. What is the significance of the contrast between divine care for the righteous and destruction of the wicked in v. 20?
9. How does the psalm's use of traditional divine epithets (v. 8) connect to broader biblical covenantal language?
10. What role does creation theology play in the psalm's vision of universal praise?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (9)

1. Why does the psalm use the unique superscription 'תְּהִלָּה' instead of the common 'מִזְמוֹר'?
2. What accounts for the apparent missing nun verse in the acrostic structure - scribal error or theological intention?
3. How does the triple accumulation 'הֲדַר כְּבוֹד הוֹדֶךָ' function - semantic distinction or poetic intensification?
4. Why does the LXX add an extra line about God's faithfulness after v13?
5. How do we reconcile universal divine mercy (v9) with the destruction of the wicked (v20)?
6. What distinguishes 'works' (מַעֲשֶׂיךָ) from 'mighty acts' (גְּבוּרֹתֶיךָ) from 'wondrous acts' (נִפְלְאֹתֶיךָ)?
7. Does 'all flesh' (כׇּל־בָּשָׂר) in v21 include all living creatures or only humans?
8. Why combine liquid metaphor (יַבִּיעוּ - gush forth) with musical imagery (יְרַנֵּנוּ - sing) in v7?
9. What does 'calling in truth' (בֶאֱמֶת) mean as a condition for divine nearness?
