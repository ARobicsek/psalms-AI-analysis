and all creatures shall bless His holy name forever and ever.

## Introduction
Psalm 145 is unique in the Psalter. Its superscription calls it a tehillah—a “song of praise”—and, as rabbinic tradition noticed, it is the one psalm that fully embodies the genre its title names. The poem’s alphabetic acrostic (aleph to tav), the drumbeat of its “all’s” (kol), and its refusal to lapse into petition give it the feel of a crafted liturgy: a complete A-to-Z of praise. It also stands at a strategic seam. After a closing group of Davidic psalms (Pss 138–145), Psalm 145 opens into the Hallelujahs (Pss 146–150). In Jewish prayer it anchors Ashrei; the Talmud promises that “whoever recites ‘Tehillah of David’ three times a day is assured of the world to come” (Berakhot 4b)—a liturgical verdict that already anticipates two of its core reasons: the acrostic steadiness of its praise and the signature line of providence, “You open Your hand” (v. 16).

The psalm’s opening announces its theological method. “I will exalt you, my God, the king” (v. 1). The Hebrew pairing elohai hamelekh (“my God, the king”) is striking. It holds intimacy and majesty in one breath: God as personally possessed, yet the king as public sovereign. From that paradox the poem proceeds by widening circles. The “I” of vv. 1–2, with its daily and perpetual vows (“every day … forever and ever”), yields to “generation to generation” in v. 4. The idiom recurs across the Bible (e.g., Ps 79:13; 89:2; 90:1; Isa 34:10), always concerned with continuity; here it names praise’s pedagogy. Different verbs paint transmission as praise (yeshabbaḥ), declaration (yaggīdū), meditation (ʾāsīḥā), and enumerating (ʾasapperennāh). Praise is a craft—taught, rehearsed, handed down.

At v. 3 the psalm defers from definition to doxology: “Great is the LORD … and his greatness is unsearchable.” The idiom “unsearchable” (ʾēn ḥēqer) is part of a wider scriptural idiom for God’s fathomless reality (Job 5:9; 9:10; Isa 40:28). In Psalm 145 that inexhaustibility is not an obstacle to praise; it is its motor. Because God’s greatness cannot be finally measured, generations never run out of reasons or words.

The theological kernel falls in vv. 8–9. The psalm cites the great creed of Exod 34:6—“gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love”—but then presses its horizon outward: “The LORD is good to all, and his mercies are over all his works.” The covenant attributes once spoken to Israel at Sinai are now said of all that God has made. The double “all” matters. It anticipates the psalm’s later liturgical commonwealth: all works (v. 10), all generations (v. 13), all who fall (v. 14), the eyes of all (v. 15), every living thing (v. 16), all his ways/works (v. 17), all who call (v. 18), all who fear/love (vv. 19–20), all flesh (v. 21). No psalm deploys kol with more purposeful insistence. Formally, it is anaphora; theologically, it is a claim that providence and praise know no border.

Between these stanzas comes the psalm’s royal section (vv. 10–13), where creation and the faithful become two choirs—“all your works shall thank you … and your ḥasidim shall bless you”—and the theme is kingship. The idiom is the stock of Ancient Near Eastern royal hymnody: “Your kingship is a kingship for all ages; your dominion through every generation.” The point is not that the psalm quotes Ugaritic verse but that it claims the common political vocabulary for YHWH and fills it with a different content. This king reigns not by tribute but by provision; the acclamation is not flattery but gratitude. A textual note belongs here: the Masoretic Text lacks a nun-line in the acrostic, but a nun-verse (“Faithful is the LORD in all his words and ḥasid in all his works”) appears in the Septuagint and in a Dead Sea Scroll (11QPs-a). Many modern editions and translations print it (often as v. 13b), and its content dovetails with vv. 17–20. The rabbinic homily that David “saw a fall” in nun (Amos 5:2) and so “supported” it with v. 14 (Berakhot 4b) is a theological reading of what was likely a textual loss; both are worth knowing, the one for philology, the other for wisdom.

Then comes the psalm’s signature turn. After the high claims about eternal kingship (v. 13), the poem pivots to low places: “The LORD supports all who are falling and raises all who are bowed down” (v. 14). The verbs are participles—ongoing action—and their pairing is memorably echoed in the next psalm (Ps 146:8: “The LORD raises up those who are bowed down”). Here is royal theology refitted: the king’s greatness is measured by his upholding of the vulnerable. The feeding lines that follow (vv. 15–16) draw on idioms elsewhere: “The eyes of all look to you” (cf. Ps 104:27) and “You open your hand” (cf. Deut 15:8, the ethical command to “open your hand” to the poor, and Ps 104:28’s depiction of God’s bounty). Psalm 145 applies a human moral obligation to God’s mode of rule: the divine hand is open. The contested noun rāṣōn (v. 16) can denote either “favor” (divine goodwill) or “desire” (creaturely appetite). The LXX’s eudokia leans toward the former; the context sustains both: God’s favor meets each creature’s fitting desire.

The second half (vv. 17–20) recapitulates the moral underpinning of this accessibility. God is ṣaddiq (“righteous”) in all his ways and ḥasid (“faithful/loyal”) in all his works—an unusual application of ḥasid to God (cf. Jer 3:12). Therefore “the LORD is near to all who call on him … in truth” (v. 18): availability meets integrity. The sequence of v. 19 (fulfill desire, hear cry, save) describes comprehensive providence—proactive and responsive. Verse 20 introduces necessary tension: “The LORD guards all who love him, but all the wicked he will destroy.” The hymn’s universalism is not indiscriminate. Mercy “over all his works” does not nullify the reality of wickedness; judgment serves love by removing what corrodes the common good (cf. Mal 3:19 [4:1]).

The final verse returns to the opening “I,” now enlarged by the chorus of “all flesh.” An acrostic that aspires to total praise closes by asking that every living thing bless God’s holy name “forever and ever.” The psalm holds together a theology that is both expansive and exacting: the king of all ages is the God who opens his hand; the provider of every creature’s due is near to the truthful caller; and the universal scope of care does not blur moral distinctions. It is a commonwealth of praise, where sovereignty is recognized in gratitude for sustenance, and the alphabet of praise becomes a grammar of mercy.

## Verse-by-Verse Commentary
### Verse 1
תְּהִלָּ֗ה לְדָ֫וִ֥ד אֲרוֹמִמְךָ֣ אֱלוֹקַ֣י הַמֶּ֑לֶךְ וַאֲבָרְכָ֥ה שִׁ֝מְךָ֗ לְעוֹלָ֥ם וָעֶֽד׃
A song of praise. Of David.
I will extol You, my God and king,
and bless Your name forever and ever.
“Tehillah of David.” This lone superscription signals content: an unbroken hymn. The opening clause, “I will exalt you, my God, the king,” pairs elohai (“my God”) with hamelekh (“the king”), a juxtaposition that fuses intimacy and sovereignty. The verb ʾaromimkha (from r-w-m, “to raise/exalt”) often marks liturgical acclaim (Exod 15:2; Ps 30:2). “Bless your name” draws on the biblical idiom in which “name” stands for character and reputation; to “bless” it is to voice gratitude and acknowledgment. The temporal frame—“forever and ever”—forms an inclusio with v. 21 and, with “every day” in v. 2, balances the ordinary with the perpetual. The verse sets the psalm’s arc: personal vow as the seed of a universal chorus.
---
### Verse 2
בְּכׇל־י֥וֹם אֲבָרְכֶ֑ךָּ וַאֲהַלְלָ֥ה שִׁ֝מְךָ֗ לְעוֹלָ֥ם וָעֶֽד׃
Every day will I bless You
and praise Your name forever and ever.
“Every day” (bekhol-yom) turns praise into habit rather than occasion. The two verbs—“I will bless … and I will praise”—are complementary: berakhah (blessing) accents gratitude, while hillēl (praise) leans toward public acclamation. The repetition of “forever and ever” knits daily rhythm to eschatological scope. The verse proposes a liturgical anthropology: praise is not episodic; it is a way of keeping time.
---
### Verse 3
גָּ֘ד֤וֹל ה׳ וּמְהֻלָּ֣ל מְאֹ֑ד וְ֝לִגְדֻלָּת֗וֹ אֵ֣ין חֵֽקֶר׃
Great is the LORD and much acclaimed;
His greatness cannot be fathomed.
“Great … and greatly praised.” The near-figure: gādōl/gĕdullāh creates a sonic emphasis on magnitude. “His greatness is unsearchable” (ʾēn ḥēqer) belongs to a recurring idiom for the divine’s unfathomable range (Job 5:9; 9:10; Isa 40:28). In Psalm 145 this confession is a hinge: it both humbles and energizes praise. The impossibility of exhaustive measurement keeps speech flowing from generation to generation; the ocean is never sounded.
---
### Verse 4
דּ֣וֹר לְ֭דוֹר יְשַׁבַּ֣ח מַעֲשֶׂ֑יךָ וּגְב֖וּרֹתֶ֣יךָ יַגִּֽידוּ׃
One generation shall laud Your works to another
and declare Your mighty acts.
“Generation to generation” (dor le-dor) is a biblical way to talk about continuity (cf. Ps 79:13; 89:2; 90:1; Isa 34:10). The verbs vary praise’s mode: yeshabbaḥ (“laud/praise”), yaggīdū (“declare, tell”). The objects vary too: God’s maʿasim (“works,” creative/providential) and gĕvurot (“mighty acts,” often redemptive interventions; cf. Exod 15:6; Ps 106:2). Praise is pedagogical: testimony, not mere feeling.
---
### Verse 5
הֲ֭דַר כְּב֣וֹד הוֹדֶ֑ךָ וְדִבְרֵ֖י נִפְלְאֹתֶ֣יךָ אָשִֽׂיחָה׃
The glorious majesty of Your splendor
and Your wondrous acts-a will I recite.
The construct chain—hădar kevod hodekha—heaps three glory-terms: hădar (splendor), kavod (weight/glory), hod (majesty/vigor). Such clustering is rare and deliberate (cf. Ps 96:6; 104:1). The first person returns: “I will meditate/recite” (ʾāsīḥā, from ś-y-ḥ), a verb that can mean musing aloud (cf. Ps 119:15). The object, niplʾotekha (“wondrous deeds”), typically names acts that exceed ordinary causation and mark divine agency. Public proclamation rests on private rumination.
---
### Verse 6
וֶעֱז֣וּז נֽוֹרְאֹתֶ֣יךָ יֹאמֵ֑רוּ (וגדלותיך) [וּגְדֻלָּתְךָ֥] אֲסַפְּרֶֽנָּה׃
Men shall talk of the might of Your awesome deeds,
and I will recount Your greatness.
“Power of your awesome deeds” (ʿezūz noraʾotekha) yokes a noun of might (ʿezūz; cf. Ps 24:8: “the LORD strong [ʿizzūz] and mighty”) with “awesome things” (noraʾot), a frequent marker of the fearsome element in salvation history. The alternation “they will speak … I will recount” choreographs communal and individual witness. The verb “recount” (sipper) implies enumeration; praise is willing to be specific, to number mercies.
---
### Verse 7
זֵ֣כֶר רַב־טוּבְךָ֣ יַבִּ֑יעוּ וְצִדְקָתְךָ֥ יְרַנֵּֽנוּ׃
They shall celebrate Your abundant goodness,
and sing joyously of Your beneficence.
“They will gush forth the memorial of your abundant goodness.” The verb yabbīʿū (from n-b-ʿ) usually describes liquid springing forth; when applied to speech it casts testimony as an outflow. This metaphor appears elsewhere: “Day to day pours forth speech” (Ps 19:3); “I will pour forth riddles” (Ps 78:2); “they pour forth insolence” (Ps 94:4). The pattern is frequent in sapiential and praise contexts, often contrasting restrained wise speech with the torrent of the wicked. Here it marks abundance: goodness overflows in remembered report. The parallel colon—“they shall sing of your righteousness”—balances cognitive “memorial” with celebratory song.
---
### Verse 8
חַנּ֣וּן וְרַח֣וּם ה׳ אֶ֥רֶךְ אַ֝פַּ֗יִם וּגְדׇל־חָֽסֶד׃
The LORD is gracious and compassionate,
slow to anger and abounding in kindness.
A citation of Exod 34:6, the fountainhead of Israel’s creed: “gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, and abounding in ḥesed.” The four terms span favor (ḥannūn), parental compassion (raḥūm), patience (ʾerekh appayim, literally “long of nostrils”), and covenant love (rav ḥesed). Within Psalm 145 the citation’s weight is doubled by what follows.
---
### Verse 9
טוֹב־ה׳ לַכֹּ֑ל וְ֝רַחֲמָ֗יו עַל־כׇּל־מַעֲשָֽׂיו׃
The LORD is good to all,
and His mercy is upon all His works.
“The LORD is good to all, and his mercies are over all his works.” The double kol universalizes the attributes just named. “Over” (ʿal) casts mercy as an atmosphere or covering. The plural “mercies” implies multiple manifestations. Traditional Jewish commentators already drew ethical conclusions: if mercy extends to all creatures, human conduct should mirror it. The psalm thus moves from covenant theology to creation theology without abandoning either.
---
### Verse 10
יוֹד֣וּךָ ה׳ כׇּל־מַעֲשֶׂ֑יךָ וַ֝חֲסִידֶ֗יךָ יְבָרְכֽוּכָה׃
All Your works shall praise You, O LORD,
and Your faithful ones shall bless You.
“All your works shall thank you … and your ḥasidim shall bless you.” Creation’s personification is biblically familiar (Ps 98:8; Isa 55:12), but the two-choir structure is distinctive: the whole created order expresses gratitude by being itself in harmonious order; the faithful (ḥasidim) add articulate blessing. Two verbs—yōdū (give thanks/confess) and yĕvarekhū (bless)—suggest spontaneity and intention. The verse is a hinge between universal scope and covenant community.
---
### Verse 11
כְּב֣וֹד מַלְכוּתְךָ֣ יֹאמֵ֑רוּ וּגְבוּרָתְךָ֥ יְדַבֵּֽרוּ׃
They shall talk of the majesty of Your kingship,
and speak of Your might,
“They shall speak of the glory of your kingship, and talk of your might.” “Kingship” (malkhūt) paired with “glory” recasts sovereignty as radiant stability rather than mere force. The two speech-verbs (yōmerū / yĕdabberū) shade from simple saying to discursive explanation. Praise here becomes public theology.
---
### Verse 12
לְהוֹדִ֤יעַ ׀ לִבְנֵ֣י הָ֭אָדָם גְּבוּרֹתָ֑יו וּ֝כְב֗וֹד הֲדַ֣ר מַלְכוּתֽוֹ׃
to make His mighty acts known among men
and the majestic glory of His kingship.
“To make known to the sons of Adam his mighty deeds, and the glorious majesty of his kingship.” The audience is now universal humanity (livnē hāʾādām). The phrase “glory of the splendor of his kingship” reprises v. 5’s cluster but applies it to rule. Kingship in this psalm seeks publicity—missionary monarchy, if one may call it that—because it is good news about providence, not a threat of domination.

Verse 13 (MT) 
“Your kingship is a kingship for all ages, and your dominion in every generation.” The formula is standard royal diction in the ANE, turned toward YHWH. “Kingship” (malkhūt) speaks of realm; “dominion” (memshalah) of active governance. “All ages … every generation” pairs cosmic and historical time. 

Verse 13b (LXX/11QPs-a; probable original nun)
“Faithful is the LORD in all his words and ḥasid in all his works.” The line rounds out the acrostic and anticipates vv. 17–20. The double kol resumes the psalm’s universal refrain. The unusual application of ḥasid to God matches v. 17 and Jer 3:12.
---
### Verse 13
מַֽלְכוּתְךָ֗ מַלְכ֥וּת כׇּל־עֹלָמִ֑ים וּ֝מֶֽמְשַׁלְתְּךָ֗ בְּכׇל־דּ֥וֹר וָדֹֽר׃
Your kingship is an eternal kingship;
Your dominion is for all generations.
[Commentary not found]
---
### Verse 14
סוֹמֵ֣ךְ ה׳ לְכׇל־הַנֹּפְלִ֑ים וְ֝זוֹקֵ֗ף לְכׇל־הַכְּפוּפִֽים׃
The LORD supports all who stumble,
and makes all who are bent stand straight.
“The LORD supports all who are falling and raises all who are bowed down.” After the cosmic claims, the poem turns to close care. The participles (“supporting … raising”) present ongoing acts. The vocabulary recurs immediately in Ps 146:8 (“The LORD raises up [zōqef] those who are bowed down”), creating a canonical echo. This is royal theology transposed: sovereignty as upholding the vulnerable.
---
### Verse 15
עֵֽינֵי־כֹ֭ל אֵלֶ֣יךָ יְשַׂבֵּ֑רוּ וְאַתָּ֤ה נֽוֹתֵן־לָהֶ֖ם אֶת־אׇכְלָ֣ם בְּעִתּֽוֹ׃
The eyes of all look to You expectantly,
and You give them their food when it is due.
“The eyes of all look to you expectantly, and you give them their food in its season.” The idiom of “eyes” looking in hope also appears in Ps 104:27, where all creatures wait for their food. The verb yeshabbeirū (Aramaizing “hope/wait expectantly”) is rare and, paired with “in season,” emphasizes patient sufficiency rather than panic. Provision is as much about timing as about quantity.
---
### Verse 16
פּוֹתֵ֥חַ אֶת־יָדֶ֑ךָ וּמַשְׂבִּ֖יעַ לְכׇל־חַ֣י רָצֽוֹן׃
You give it openhandedly,
feeding every creature to its heart’s content.
“You open your hand and satisfy every living thing with favor/desire.” The anthropomorphism belongs to a biblical idiom for generosity. Deut 15:8 commands humans to “open your hand” to the needy; Ps 104:28 says of God, “You open your hand; they are satisfied with good.” Psalm 145 uniquely applies the human ethical idiom as a definition of divine kingship: cosmic hospitality. The noun rāṣōn bears a double sense: God satisfies with his favor (LXX: eudokia), and he meets each creature’s fitting desire. The ambiguity is the point: divine goodwill manifests by suiting the appetite of each life.
---
### Verse 17
צַדִּ֣יק ה׳ בְּכׇל־דְּרָכָ֑יו וְ֝חָסִ֗יד בְּכׇל־מַעֲשָֽׂיו׃
The LORD is beneficent in all His ways
and faithful in all His works.
“Righteous is the LORD in all his ways and ḥasid in all his works.” The pairing takes two moral adjectives typically applied to humans and predicates them of God. Ṣaddiq grounds God’s reliability; ḥasid (rare for God; cf. Jer 3:12) underscores loyal, gracious consistency. The double kol keeps the universality in view.
---
### Verse 18
קָר֣וֹב ה׳ לְכׇל־קֹרְאָ֑יו לְכֹ֤ל אֲשֶׁ֖ר יִקְרָאֻ֣הוּ בֶאֱמֶֽת׃
The LORD is near to all who call Him,
to all who call Him with sincerity.
“The LORD is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth.” Nearness answers majesty. The condition “in truth” (beʾemet) signifies sincerity and integrity rather than mere correctness; compare Jer 29:12–13 for the convergence of calling and wholehearted seeking. Availability is real but not mechanical: a relationship is envisioned, not a hotline to power.
---
### Verse 19
רְצוֹן־יְרֵאָ֥יו יַעֲשֶׂ֑ה וְֽאֶת־שַׁוְעָתָ֥ם יִ֝שְׁמַ֗ע וְיוֹשִׁיעֵֽם׃
He fulfills the wishes of those who fear Him;
He hears their cry and delivers them.
“He fulfills the desire of those who fear him; he hears their cry and saves them.” The threefold sequence—fulfill desire / hear cry / save—describes comprehensive providence, both proactive (fitting desires) and reactive (rescue in distress). “Fear” here is reverent orientation, not terror; the alignment of desire with fear signals wise ordering of loves.
---
### Verse 20
שׁוֹמֵ֣ר ה׳ אֶת־כׇּל־אֹהֲבָ֑יו וְאֵ֖ת כׇּל־הָרְשָׁעִ֣ים יַשְׁמִֽיד׃
The LORD watches over all who love Him,
but all the wicked He will destroy.
“The LORD guards all who love him, but all the wicked he will destroy.” The psalm’s universal care is not moral neutrality. Love and wickedness are opposed stances toward the good order the psalm celebrates. Judgment serves mercy by removing what devours the common good (cf. Mal 3:19 [4:1]). The double kol maintains symmetry: comprehensive keeping and comprehensive unmasking.
---
### Verse 21
תְּהִלַּ֥ת ה׳ יְֽדַבֶּ֫ר־פִּ֥י וִיבָרֵ֣ךְ כׇּל־בָּ֭שָׂר שֵׁ֥ם קׇדְשׁ֗וֹ לְעוֹלָ֥ם וָעֶֽד׃ {פ}
My mouth shall utter the praise of the LORD,
and all creatures shall bless His holy name forever and ever.
“My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD, and all flesh shall bless his holy name forever and ever.” The ending returns to the individual voice now surrounded by a universal choir. “All flesh” usually includes humans and animals (Gen 6–9; Ps 136:25), linking back to vv. 15–16. The inclusio with “forever and ever” (vv. 1–2, 21) frames the psalm’s vision: a lifelong, daily praise that becomes, by God’s reign of open-handed providence, a chorus of all living things.

Figurative language notes (selected):
- “Pour forth” (yabbīʿū, v. 7): metaphor of speech as spring-water; cf. Ps 19:3; 78:2; 94:4. Typical contexts contrast wisdom’s measured utterance with wicked abundance; here abundance signals goodness.
- “Open your hand” (v. 16): ethical idiom for generosity (Deut 15:8, 11) transposed to divine providence; closely paralleled in Ps 104:28.
- “Eyes of all look” (v. 15): creaturely dependence (Ps 104:27) rendered via bodily metaphor, stressing expectation and timing.

Reception note: The acrostic structure and v. 16’s line explain the psalm’s centrality in Jewish prayer (Ashrei). The tradition’s promise (Berakhot 4b) is exegetical: an A-to-Z hymn of a God whose hand is open, near to truth, and just in all ways is an education in praise that prepares one for the world to come.
