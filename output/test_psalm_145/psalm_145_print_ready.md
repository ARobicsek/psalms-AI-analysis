and all creatures shall bless His holy name forever and ever.

## Introduction
Psalm 145 is the only psalm in the Psalter whose superscription is Tehillah—“a praise.” That singular label does not deny that the other poems praise God; rather, it suggests that this acrostic hymn is a worked exemplar of praise—an A‑to‑Z of how Israel names God’s greatness and lives into it. Its artistry is not ornament. The poem’s alphabetic scaffolding orders the movement from an “I” that vows daily blessing (vv. 1–2), to a “they” that hands on testimony (vv. 4–7), to “all” creation which receives and returns God’s bounty (vv. 9–10, 15–21). The poem is, in short, pedagogy: it trains the tongue, and through the tongue the heart.

The acrostic is complete save for the nun line. Ancient Greek translators, perhaps uneasy with the gap, supplied a line after v. 13: “Faithful is the LORD in his words and holy in all his works.” The Masoretic Text leaves the acrostic imperfect. That imperfection, read literarily, fits the psalm’s own confession: “His greatness—there is no searching it” (v. 3). A rosary of letters cannot exhaust the divine. Whether the gap reflects transmission history or design, the received Hebrew form gives the stanza’s cadence a subtle hitch: completeness stretched by what exceeds it.

Two hinge features govern the poem’s thought. First is a creed: “Gracious and compassionate is the LORD, slow to anger and abundant in steadfast love” (v. 8). Drawn from Exodus 34:6, this fourfold formula is Israel’s center of gravity; here it forms the heart of the acrostic (ח), the pivot from God’s unsearchable greatness (vv. 1–7) to God’s broad goodness and near care (vv. 9–21). Second is a refrain of expansiveness marked by kol, “all”: “The LORD is good to all” (v. 9), “His compassion is over all his works” (v. 9), “All your works shall thank you” (v. 10), “all who are falling,” “all who are bowed down” (v. 14), “the eyes of all” (v. 15), “every living thing” (v. 16), “in all his ways…in all his works” (v. 17), “to all who call…all who call in truth” (v. 18), “the desire of those who fear him,” “all who love him,” “all the wicked” (vv. 19–20), and finally “all flesh” (v. 21). The poem’s rhetoric of “all” is not bland universality; it is carefully contoured by “truth” (v. 18), “fear” and “love” (vv. 19–20), and the reality of judgment (v. 20). But its scope is unmistakably wide.

Psalm 145 resolves a tension often caricatured: if God is King, must divine sovereignty be displayed as domination? Verses 11–13 stack royal vocabulary—“glory of your kingdom,” “the majestic glory of his kingdom,” “your kingdom is a kingdom of all ages; your dominion in every generation.” Such formulae draw on shared royal idiom in Israel’s world, where divine reign is celebrated by permanence and reach. The psalm appropriates that idiom but redefines its content. The true King is recognized not by violence, but by nearness and providence. Immediately after the kingship stanza comes the turn: “The LORD supports all who are falling and straightens all who are bent” (v. 14); “The eyes of all look to you…and you open your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing” (vv. 15–16). The gesture that sums divine rule is an opened hand, not a clenched fist.

Those two images—supporting the falling and opening the hand—concentrate biblical idioms that are worth hearing in their larger register. “Falling” (נפל) is a common Hebrew verb for collapse, defeat, and death. Its use here (v. 14) belongs to a pattern in which God’s care meets creatures in their low estate (cf. Ps 146:8; the idiom “face fell” for dejection in Gen 4:5–6). The “opened hand” in v. 16 draws on the Deuteronomic ethic: “You shall open, yes open your hand to the poor” (Deut 15:8; see also 15:11). Psalm 104:28 already applied that idiom to God—“You open your hand; they are satisfied with good”—and Psalm 145 renews it. Israel’s social instruction is not a mere humanism; it mirrors divine practice.

The poem’s figuration of praise is equally tactile. In v. 7 the verb נבע (“to bubble up, gush”) describes speech as a spring: “They will cause the remembrance of your abundant goodness to gush forth.” Elsewhere this same verb depicts creation’s wordless proclamation (Ps 19:3: “Day to day pours forth speech”), a sage’s instruction (Ps 78:2), or the wicked’s insolence (Ps 94:4). The metaphor is chosen to insist that praise is not a performance but an artesian response: what God pours out returns in kind.

Finally, the psalm’s end makes explicit what its beginning only intimated. It starts in the first person—“I will extol… I will bless”—and closes with a wide summons: “Let all flesh bless his holy name forever and ever” (v. 21). “All flesh” is a deliberately capacious phrase; it gathers not only Israel or “sons of man” (v. 12) but the living order. The logic is consistent: if “his compassion is over all his works” (v. 9), then “all his works” answer in thanksgiving (v. 10), “the eyes of all” wait (v. 15), and “all flesh” blesses (v. 21). The psalm thus teaches not only what to say about God, but how the saying enlarges the speaker, drawing the solitary voice into a chorus. It is indeed a praise—singular—composed to make many.
## Verse-by-Verse Commentary
### Verse 1
תְּהִלָּ֗ה לְדָ֫וִ֥ד אֲרוֹמִמְךָ֣ אֱלוֹקַ֣י הַמֶּ֑לֶךְ וַאֲבָרְכָ֥ה שִׁ֝מְךָ֗ לְעוֹלָ֥ם וָעֶֽד׃
A song of praise. Of David.
I will extol You, my God and king,
and bless Your name forever and ever.
“Tehillah. Of David. I will exalt you, my God the King, and I will bless your name forever and ever.” The rare superscription “Tehillah” marks this psalm as an exemplar of praise. The pairing “my God the King” holds together intimacy and sovereignty. The first person verbs (“I will exalt,” “I will bless”) are in the imperfect, indicating an ongoing vow, and are framed by the temporal merism “forever and ever,” a formula that recurs (vv. 1–2; v. 21) to bind opening and close (an inclusio). The psalm’s acrostic form (each line beginning with successive letters) already signals a program of comprehensiveness; the vow is not ambient devotion but disciplined speech. The address “my God the King” sets the psalm’s paradox from the start: the King is “my God,” not a remote polity. This fusion structures the rest: the “I” becomes “they,” and “they” becomes “all flesh.” That expansion is grounded in v. 1’s claim that even eternal praise begins as a daily, voiced act (cf. v. 2).
---
### Verse 2
בְּכׇל־י֥וֹם אֲבָרְכֶ֑ךָּ וַאֲהַלְלָ֥ה שִׁ֝מְךָ֗ לְעוֹלָ֥ם וָעֶֽד׃
Every day will I bless You
and praise Your name forever and ever.
“Every day I will bless you, and I will praise your name forever and ever.” The movement from eternity (v. 1) to the diurnal (“every day”) in v. 2 makes an important point: the eternal scope is realized in habitual practice. The verbs distinguish spheres: to “bless” God often means to acknowledge and thank for concrete benefactions; to “praise” the Name is to publish God’s character and reputation. The coordination of daily blessing with eternal praise renders time porous: ordinary days participate in the “forever.” The repeated “forever and ever” pairs with the later “in every generation” (v. 13) to stretch the poem’s temporal field from the present worshiper through posterity.
---
### Verse 3
גָּ֘ד֤וֹל ה׳ וּמְהֻלָּ֣ל מְאֹ֑ד וְ֝לִגְדֻלָּת֗וֹ אֵ֣ין חֵֽקֶר׃
Great is the LORD and much acclaimed;
His greatness cannot be fathomed.
“Great is the LORD and greatly to be praised; and his greatness—there is no searching it.” The first explicit theological statement in the third person signals the public, proverbial status of what follows. The Pual participle “is praised” suggests an ongoing, communal action owed to God. “No searching” (אין חקר) is a wisdom idiom (cf. Job 5:9; 9:10; Isa 40:28) acknowledging the horizon of human knowledge. The acrostic’s attempt at comprehensiveness thus opens by confessing its own insufficiency. The verse doublets divine greatness and appropriate human response: because his greatness is unsearchable, praise must be continual and communal. Psalm 145 will enact that through its alphabetic form and its expansion from “I” to “all.”
---
### Verse 4
דּ֣וֹר לְ֭דוֹר יְשַׁבַּ֣ח מַעֲשֶׂ֑יךָ וּגְב֖וּרֹתֶ֣יךָ יַגִּֽידוּ׃
One generation shall laud Your works to another
and declare Your mighty acts.
“One generation shall commend your works to another, and your mighty acts they shall declare.” The refrain דּוֹר לְדוֹר (“generation to generation”) names the vehicle of continuity. The paired verbs—“commend/praise” (שבח) and “declare” (נגד)—suggest liturgical testimony and didactic proclamation. “Works” (מעשים) are broad; “mighty acts” (גבורות) are concentrated interventions (creation, deliverance). The verse sketches the psalm’s pedagogy: praise is not only upward address but horizontal transmission. That transmission will culminate at the other horizon—beyond Israel’s generations to “all flesh” (v. 21).
---
### Verse 5
הֲ֭דַר כְּב֣וֹד הוֹדֶ֑ךָ וְדִבְרֵ֖י נִפְלְאֹתֶ֣יךָ אָשִֽׂיחָה׃
The glorious majesty of Your splendor
and Your wondrous acts-a will I recite.
“On the splendor of the glory of your majesty I will meditate, and on the words of your wonders.” The triple construct הֲדַר כְּבוֹד הוֹדֶךָ (“splendor of the glory of your majesty”) stacks near-synonyms to intensify radiance: hadar (ornamented splendor), kavod (weighty presence), and hod (brilliance). The effect is cumulative: not mere superlatives but facets of manifest dignity. The first person returns with אָשִׂיחָה (“I will meditate/speak”), a verb that elsewhere ranges from complaint to musing (cf. Ps 77:4; 119:15). Here it signals sustained, reflective attention before exuberant proclamation (vv. 6–7). “Words of your wonders” suggests that God’s extraordinary acts (נפלאות) communicate; they are not mute events but deeds that say. The psalm will treat praise as a practiced attentiveness to what divine action means.
---
### Verse 6
וֶעֱז֣וּז נֽוֹרְאֹתֶ֣יךָ יֹאמֵ֑רוּ (וגדלותיך) [וּגְדֻלָּתְךָ֥] אֲסַפְּרֶֽנָּה׃
Men shall talk of the might of Your awesome deeds,
and I will recount Your greatness.
“People will speak of the might of your awesome deeds, and I will recount your greatness.” The stanza alternates communal “they will say” with personal “I will recount,” modeling how public speech and individual testimony reinforce one another. עֱזוּז (“might”) is a rare intensive for strength, paired with “awesome deeds” (נוראות)—acts that evoke fear and awe. A Masoretic note preserves a Qere/Ketiv variant on “your greatness,” reminding us that scribes attended closely to this verse’s wording, perhaps precisely because it was used liturgically. The rhetorical motion is from particular terrifying acts to the abiding, less graspable “greatness.” The liturgy does not stop with the spectacular; it interprets deeds back into character.
---
### Verse 7
זֵ֣כֶר רַב־טוּבְךָ֣ יַבִּ֑יעוּ וְצִדְקָתְךָ֥ יְרַנֵּֽנוּ׃
They shall celebrate Your abundant goodness,
and sing joyously of Your beneficence.
“They shall bubble forth the remembrance of your abundant goodness, and shall sing aloud of your righteousness.” The verb יַבִּיעוּ (from נבע, “to gush”) is carefully chosen. Elsewhere it marks the world’s wordless proclamation (Ps 19:3: “day to day pours forth speech”), the psalmist’s teaching (Ps 78:2), and even the wicked’s insolence (Ps 94:4). The pattern suggests force and abundance: speech under pressure, as from a spring. Here the remembrance (זכר) of “abundant goodness” (רב־טוב) is the artesian source of praise. The second colon moves from testimony to song: “they will ring out (ירננו) your righteousness.” Righteousness here is not abstract retributive rectitude; in the psalm’s arc it is the integrity by which God’s actions fit God’s character (see vv. 17–20).
---
### Verse 8
חַנּ֣וּן וְרַח֣וּם ה׳ אֶ֥רֶךְ אַ֝פַּ֗יִם וּגְדׇל־חָֽסֶד׃
The LORD is gracious and compassionate,
slow to anger and abounding in kindness.
“Gracious and compassionate is the LORD, slow to anger and abundant in steadfast love.” This is Israel’s creed (Exod 34:6) placed at the acrostic’s heart. The terms carry weight: חנון (unmerited favor), רחום (compassion with visceral freight), אֶרֶךְ אַפַּיִם (“long of nostrils,” i.e., patient), and רב/גדול חסד (abundant covenant loyalty). The verse functions as hinge: it interprets God’s greatness (vv. 1–7) and grounds what follows (vv. 9–21). Because this is who God is, the “all” of v. 9 can be said without embarrassment, and the “nearness” of v. 18 can be trusted. The psalm will also tether this creed to discernment: compassion does not cancel judgment (v. 20).
---
### Verse 9
טוֹב־ה׳ לַכֹּ֑ל וְ֝רַחֲמָ֗יו עַל־כׇּל־מַעֲשָֽׂיו׃
The LORD is good to all,
and His mercy is upon all His works.
“Good is the LORD to all, and his compassions are over all his works.” The double kol (“all”) enlarges the scope from covenant Israel to creation. This is not an erasure of particularity but its expansion: the God who revealed himself to Israel is the maker and carer of all creatures. The phrase “over all his works” is comprehensive, reaching beyond humans to the living order. This sets up v. 10’s personified chorus and v. 16’s comprehensive provision. The tension with v. 20 (the wicked) is real; the psalm resolves it not by retracting this universalism, but by distinguishing kinds of divine action (provision to all creatures, responsive nearness to callers, preservative care for lovers, judgment on persistent wickedness).
---
### Verse 10
יוֹד֣וּךָ ה׳ כׇּל־מַעֲשֶׂ֑יךָ וַ֝חֲסִידֶ֗יךָ יְבָרְכֽוּכָה׃
All Your works shall praise You, O LORD,
and Your faithful ones shall bless You.
“All your works shall thank you, O LORD, and your faithful ones shall bless you.” The first colon personifies creation—“works” that “give thanks”—as in Psalm 148 where entities are summoned to praise. The second names the covenant community (חסידים), those bound in and practicing hesed, as engaging in conscious “blessing.” The coordination is deliberate: the world as world is a chorus of thanks; the faithful give the articulate blessing that befits those who know the Name. The two lines also mirror the psalm’s two “alls”: the created order (vv. 9–10, 15–16, 21) and the moral community (vv. 18–20).
---
### Verse 11
כְּב֣וֹד מַלְכוּתְךָ֣ יֹאמֵ֑רוּ וּגְבוּרָתְךָ֥ יְדַבֵּֽרוּ׃
They shall talk of the majesty of Your kingship,
and speak of Your might,
“They shall speak of the glory of your kingdom and tell of your might.” With v. 11 the royal lexicon intensifies. “Glory of your kingdom” (כבוד מלכותך) fuses presence and rule; “might” (גבורה) names the power by which that rule is enacted. The paired verbs (“say,” “speak/declare”) suggest both spontaneous speech and deliberate proclamation. The kingship language here is not a turn away from creation; it is the theological claim that the one who cares for all exercises enduring rule.
---
### Verse 12
לְהוֹדִ֤יעַ ׀ לִבְנֵ֣י הָ֭אָדָם גְּבוּרֹתָ֑יו וּ֝כְב֗וֹד הֲדַ֣ר מַלְכוּתֽוֹ׃
to make His mighty acts known among men
and the majestic glory of His kingship.
“To make known to the sons of man his mighty deeds, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.” The infinitive “to make known” states purpose. The addressees widen: not only Israel but “sons of man” (universal humanity). The triple construct “glory of the majesty of his kingdom” (כבוד הדר מלכותו) heightens v. 11’s diction. The three terms make a ladder: glory (substantial presence), hadar (ornate splendor), and kingdom (the ordered realm of rule). The stanza’s aim is catechetical and missional: to publicize both what God has done (deeds) and who God is (king whose majesty is glorious).
---
### Verse 13
מַֽלְכוּתְךָ֗ מַלְכ֥וּת כׇּל־עֹלָמִ֑ים וּ֝מֶֽמְשַׁלְתְּךָ֗ בְּכׇל־דּ֥וֹר וָדֹֽר׃
Your kingship is an eternal kingship;
Your dominion is for all generations.
“Your kingdom is a kingdom of all ages, and your dominion in every generation.” Permanence and scope define true kingship. “All ages” (כל עולמים) and “every generation” (בכל דור ודור) bridge eternity and history. The LXX adds: “Faithful is the LORD in his words and holy in all his works.” That line, absent in the MT, matches the psalm’s cadence (“in all his works,” cf. v. 17) and supplies the missing nun in the acrostic. Read alongside the MT, it highlights qualities the psalm elsewhere stresses: God’s faithfulness and holy integrity. Whether or not one prints the addition, the Masoretic form achieves a rhetorical surprise: immediately after the proclamation of eternal reign comes the insistence that such reign is known in upholding the fallen and feeding the living (v. 14–16). The psalm’s theology of kingship is thus defined by beneficence, not conquest.
---
### Verse 14
סוֹמֵ֣ךְ ה׳ לְכׇל־הַנֹּפְלִ֑ים וְ֝זוֹקֵ֗ף לְכׇל־הַכְּפוּפִֽים׃
The LORD supports all who stumble,
and makes all who are bent stand straight.
“The LORD supports all who are falling and straightens all who are bowed down.” This is the sharpest turn in the poem: from cosmic kingship to personal and social vulnerability. “Falling” (נופלים) and “bowed” (כפופים) cover physical, emotional, and economic collapse. The verbs name both sustaining and restoring action (סמך, “to support, uphold”; זקף, “to raise, make straight”). The idiom of falling runs through Scripture as a figure for distress and death (e.g., Exod 32:28; Gen 4:5–6 as “face fell”), but here it names an incipient state—those “about to fall”—met by divine support. This is what royal power looks like when it takes flesh in care.
---
### Verse 15
עֵֽינֵי־כֹ֭ל אֵלֶ֣יךָ יְשַׂבֵּ֑רוּ וְאַתָּ֤ה נֽוֹתֵן־לָהֶ֖ם אֶת־אׇכְלָ֣ם בְּעִתּֽוֹ׃
The eyes of all look to You expectantly,
and You give them their food when it is due.
“The eyes of all look to you expectantly, and you give them their food in season.” The synecdoche “eyes of all” stands for a creation’s posture of dependence. The verb שבר in this sense (“wait, hope”) is an Aramaizing term that appears in late biblical Hebrew and captures patient expectancy (cf. Ps 104:27; Isa 38:18). The line has a close analogue in Psalm 123:2: “As the eyes of servants look to their master’s hand…so our eyes are toward the LORD our God.” In both texts, the “hand” is the place from which provision is signaled and given. “In its time” guards against a mechanistic reading: the gift is sure but not at our command. The verse returns us to v. 9’s “all”: the entire living order receives daily bread.
---
### Verse 16
פּוֹתֵ֥חַ אֶת־יָדֶ֑ךָ וּמַשְׂבִּ֖יעַ לְכׇל־חַ֣י רָצֽוֹן׃
You give it openhandedly,
feeding every creature to its heart’s content.
“You open your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing.” The idiom “open your hand” echoes Israel’s social ethic (Deut 15:8, 11) and a closely related praise (Ps 104:28). In Scripture, opening the hand is the image of generosity; here it is applied to God. The verb “satisfy” (שבע) denotes more than sufficiency; it suggests fullness and contentment (cf. Ps 104:13). “Desire” (רצון) leans toward good pleasure or favor; the point is not mere caloric provision but fitting delight. Note the continuity: kingship (v. 13) coincides with this gesture. Divine sovereignty is an opened hand.
---
### Verse 17
צַדִּ֣יק ה׳ בְּכׇל־דְּרָכָ֑יו וְ֝חָסִ֗יד בְּכׇל־מַעֲשָֽׂיו׃
The LORD is beneficent in all His ways
and faithful in all His works.
“Righteous is the LORD in all his ways, and faithful/holy in all his works.” צַדִּיק (righteous/just) asserts moral rectitude; חסיד, when predicated of God, denotes faithful kindness or holy loyalty. The parallel phrases “in all his ways / in all his works” mark comprehensive integrity: the patterns and the particulars align. The LXX renders the second adjective ὅσιος (“holy/faithful”), matching the nuance. This verse addresses a latent question: if God is good to all (v. 9) and near (v. 18), how do we speak about pain? The psalm’s answer is confessional rather than argumentative: whatever else may be said, God’s ways and works are consistent with righteousness and loyal kindness. The following verses will specify how that integrity meets human response.
---
### Verse 18
קָר֣וֹב ה׳ לְכׇל־קֹרְאָ֑יו לְכֹ֤ל אֲשֶׁ֖ר יִקְרָאֻ֣הוּ בֶאֱמֶֽת׃
The LORD is near to all who call Him,
to all who call Him with sincerity.
“Near is the LORD to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth.” Nearness here is relational availability, not spatial geometry. The double “to all” insists on accessibility; the qualifier “in truth” (בֶאֱמֶת) adds moral-spiritual grain—sincerity, reliability, alignment with reality. The psalm’s sequence matters: universal provision (vv. 15–16) is followed by responsive nearness conditioned by truthfulness. This is not a narrowing of compassion but a description of how communion with God is known: by calling in a manner consistent with who God is.
---
### Verse 19
רְצוֹן־יְרֵאָ֥יו יַעֲשֶׂ֑ה וְֽאֶת־שַׁוְעָתָ֥ם יִ֝שְׁמַ֗ע וְיוֹשִׁיעֵֽם׃
He fulfills the wishes of those who fear Him;
He hears their cry and delivers them.
“He does the desire of those who fear him; he hears their cry and saves them.” The vocabulary shifts from “all” to those in reverent relationship: יראיו (“those who fear him”). Fear, in biblical idiom, is not cringing terror but awe and proper regard. The triad of divine actions—fulfills desire, hears cry, saves—moves from ordinary longings to crisis intervention. The pairing of “desire” (רצון; cf. v. 16) with “fear” suggests that human desires are transfigured within reverence. God’s attentiveness (“hears”) culminates in salvation (ישע), a verb of deliverance from danger.
---
### Verse 20
שׁוֹמֵ֣ר ה׳ אֶת־כׇּל־אֹהֲבָ֑יו וְאֵ֖ת כׇּל־הָרְשָׁעִ֣ים יַשְׁמִֽיד׃
The LORD watches over all who love Him,
but all the wicked He will destroy.
“The LORD guards all who love him; but all the wicked he will destroy.” The progression from “fear” (v. 19) to “love” marks deepened relationship. To love God is to will God’s will and cling to God (cf. Deuteronomic idiom). God “guards” (שומר) lovers—language elsewhere used for vigilant protection (Ps 121). The antithesis is stark: wicked (רשעים)—not simply faulty people but those set against God’s character and the good of the world—are destroyed (ישמיד). This is not a retraction of v. 9’s “good to all.” Rather, it clarifies what universal mercy entails: the removal of what destroys. Divine love for the world includes a will to end the wickedness that deforms it.

### Verse 21
תְּהִלַּ֥ת ה׳ יְֽדַבֶּ֫ר־פִּ֥י וִיבָרֵ֣ךְ כׇּל־בָּ֭שָׂר שֵׁ֥ם קׇדְשׁ֗וֹ לְעוֹלָ֥ם וָעֶֽד׃ {פ}
My mouth shall utter the praise of the LORD,
and all creatures shall bless His holy name forever and ever.
“My mouth will speak the praise of the LORD, and let all flesh bless his holy name forever and ever.” The psalm returns to the first person—“my mouth”—but now that singular voice is explicitly linked to an encompassing wish: “let all flesh” bless. “All flesh” widens even beyond “sons of man” (v. 12) to the living order. The doxology closes the inclusio with “forever and ever.” The pedagogy is complete: personal praise trained by creed (v. 8), expanded by “all,” disciplined by truth (v. 18), and chastened by justice (v. 20) becomes a summons to the world. The poem has achieved what its title promised. It is a praise that makes praisers.
