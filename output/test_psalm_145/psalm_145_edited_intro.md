Psalm 145 introduces itself with a title that is as plain as it is rare: tehillah, “song of praise.” In a book later called Tehillim, this is the only psalm to bear that name as its superscription. The title is programmatic. Rather than offering episodic thanksgiving or petition, this poem composes a theology of praise—what it is, how it moves, and whom it involves.

Form frames that program. Psalm 145 is an alphabetic acrostic, an A-to-Tav ordering of the speaker’s devotion. The Masoretic Text lacks the expected nun verse between v. 13 and v. 14; the Septuagint preserves a line (“The LORD is faithful in all his words, and gracious in all his works”) and the same line is attested in Hebrew at Qumran (11QPsa) and in a few medieval manuscripts. Many modern editions therefore print it as v. 13b. Whether one reads the acrostic as complete or intentionally gapped, its craft telegraphs purpose: praise here is not occasional but comprehensive, disciplined, and encompassing.

The poem’s movement is equally crafted. It begins “I will exalt you, my God, the king” (v. 1), the first person singular pledging daily practice (v. 2). It then widens to “generation to generation” (v. 4), to the community of the faithful alongside “all your works” (v. 10), and in the end to “all flesh” (v. 21). That arc is reinforced by the poem’s insistent kol (“all”), which sounds some fifteen times across the lines (vv. 9–10, 14–18, 20–21). The repetition is not ornament but architecture: praise radiates from one mouth to a people, to humanity, and finally to all living beings.

The psalm is equally deliberate in its vocabulary for God’s activity. It distinguishes “your works” (ma‘asekha), “your mighty acts” (gevurotekha), “your wondrous deeds” (nifla’otekha), and “your awesome deeds” (nora’otekha) (vv. 4–6). These terms overlap, but their nuances matter. “Works” often name creation’s fabric (Gen 2:2–3; Ps 8:4). “Mighty acts” evoke saving power in history (Exod 15:6). “Wondrous” deeds are surpassing—acts that confound ordinary expectation (Ps 78:12). “Awesome” deeds are fear-evoking manifestations (Exod 15:11). The range suggests a curriculum of remembrance: praise rehearses creation, history, miracle, and awe, so that a generation can tell it to the next (v. 4).

At the poem’s theological core stands Israel’s creed from Exod 34:6: “The LORD is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love” (v. 8). The idiom “slow to anger” (’erekh ’appayim, literally “long of nostrils”) preserves an ancient anthropomorphism in which flaring nostrils signal anger; to be “long-nosed” is to be patient. Psalm 145 does more than cite: it universalizes. “The LORD is good to all, and his compassions are over all his works” (v. 9). Language forged in covenant is extended to creation.

That universal scope immediately encounters a boundary. The poem’s sole explicit judgment line—“The LORD guards all who love him, but all the wicked he will destroy” (v. 20)—poses a tension with v. 9’s breadth. Traditional Jewish readers have handled the tension variously. Ibn Ezra notes that God’s goodness extends even to attempts to bring the wicked to repentance; Radak imagines an eschatological end to wickedness. The psalm itself neither harmonizes nor hedges. It places mercy and justice alongside each other as constituent modes of divine kingship.

The psalm’s “royal” register is not incidental. “Your kingdom” (malkhut) and “your dominion” (memshalah) (v. 13) make governance the lens for praise. The idiom—eternal rule across generations—sits within a wider Near Eastern vocabulary of kingship. Yet the psalm inverts expectation: the King whose reign spans “all ages” (kol ‘olamim) is the one who “upholds all who are falling and raises up all who are bowed down” (v. 14). Divine power is read through providence.

Verses 15–16 pivot seamlessly from rule to care by turning to the most basic dependency: food. “The eyes of all look to you in hope” (v. 15; the Aramaizing verb sabar means “wait/hope”) recalls Psalm 104:27: “All of them look to you to give them their food in due season.” Here the provision is pictured with an idiom from Israel’s own ethics: “You open your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing” (v. 16). Deuteronomy commands Israelites to “open your hand” (pato’ach tiftach) to the needy (Deut 15:8, 11). Psalm 145 transposes the idiom from human duty to divine habit: the ruler governs by generosity. Translating ratzon in v. 16 (“desire,” “goodwill,” “what is fitting”) decides emphasis: does God satisfy creatures’ wants or provide favourably what accords with his goodwill? The Septuagint’s eudokia (“good pleasure/goodwill”) hints at the latter—a providence both abundant and wise.

From v. 17 onward, the poem gathers its themes into compact claims: “Righteous is the LORD in all his ways, and faithful/loyal (hasid) in all his works” (v. 17). That line nearly restates the nun-verse preserved in the LXX and DSS (v. 13b), suggesting the acrostic’s “missing” letter is not a theological gap so much as a formal hitch the tradition strove to mend. Accessibility is then addressed: “The LORD is near to all who call upon him— to all who call upon him in truth” (v. 18). “Truth” (’emet) in Hebrew can mean sincerity and reliability. The nearness offered to all is conditioned not by ethnicity but by genuineness.

The conclusion completes the circle: “My mouth will speak the praise of the LORD, and all flesh will bless his holy name forever and ever” (v. 21). “All flesh” in biblical idiom most often means all living creatures, though medieval exegetes (e.g., Radak) sometimes restrict it to humanity. Either way, the poem’s vision is expansive and liturgical: one voice, trained by daily discipline, becomes the seed of a chorus. Little wonder the psalm anchors Jewish daily prayer (Ashrei). On the lips of a community, its acrostic becomes what it teaches—praise as comprehensive, generative, and governed by a king whose open hand sustains every living thing.
