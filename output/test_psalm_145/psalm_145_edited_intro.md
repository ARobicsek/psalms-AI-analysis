Psalm 145 is unique in the Psalter. Its superscription calls it a tehillah—a “song of praise”—and, as rabbinic tradition noticed, it is the one psalm that fully embodies the genre its title names. The poem’s alphabetic acrostic (aleph to tav), the drumbeat of its “all’s” (kol), and its refusal to lapse into petition give it the feel of a crafted liturgy: a complete A-to-Z of praise. It also stands at a strategic seam. After a closing group of Davidic psalms (Pss 138–145), Psalm 145 opens into the Hallelujahs (Pss 146–150). In Jewish prayer it anchors Ashrei; the Talmud promises that “whoever recites ‘Tehillah of David’ three times a day is assured of the world to come” (Berakhot 4b)—a liturgical verdict that already anticipates two of its core reasons: the acrostic steadiness of its praise and the signature line of providence, “You open Your hand” (v. 16).

The psalm’s opening announces its theological method. “I will exalt you, my God, the king” (v. 1). The Hebrew pairing elohai hamelekh (“my God, the king”) is striking. It holds intimacy and majesty in one breath: God as personally possessed, yet the king as public sovereign. From that paradox the poem proceeds by widening circles. The “I” of vv. 1–2, with its daily and perpetual vows (“every day … forever and ever”), yields to “generation to generation” in v. 4. The idiom recurs across the Bible (e.g., Ps 79:13; 89:2; 90:1; Isa 34:10), always concerned with continuity; here it names praise’s pedagogy. Different verbs paint transmission as praise (yeshabbaḥ), declaration (yaggīdū), meditation (ʾāsīḥā), and enumerating (ʾasapperennāh). Praise is a craft—taught, rehearsed, handed down.

At v. 3 the psalm defers from definition to doxology: “Great is the LORD … and his greatness is unsearchable.” The idiom “unsearchable” (ʾēn ḥēqer) is part of a wider scriptural idiom for God’s fathomless reality (Job 5:9; 9:10; Isa 40:28). In Psalm 145 that inexhaustibility is not an obstacle to praise; it is its motor. Because God’s greatness cannot be finally measured, generations never run out of reasons or words.

The theological kernel falls in vv. 8–9. The psalm cites the great creed of Exod 34:6—“gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love”—but then presses its horizon outward: “The LORD is good to all, and his mercies are over all his works.” The covenant attributes once spoken to Israel at Sinai are now said of all that God has made. The double “all” matters. It anticipates the psalm’s later liturgical commonwealth: all works (v. 10), all generations (v. 13), all who fall (v. 14), the eyes of all (v. 15), every living thing (v. 16), all his ways/works (v. 17), all who call (v. 18), all who fear/love (vv. 19–20), all flesh (v. 21). No psalm deploys kol with more purposeful insistence. Formally, it is anaphora; theologically, it is a claim that providence and praise know no border.

Between these stanzas comes the psalm’s royal section (vv. 10–13), where creation and the faithful become two choirs—“all your works shall thank you … and your ḥasidim shall bless you”—and the theme is kingship. The idiom is the stock of Ancient Near Eastern royal hymnody: “Your kingship is a kingship for all ages; your dominion through every generation.” The point is not that the psalm quotes Ugaritic verse but that it claims the common political vocabulary for YHWH and fills it with a different content. This king reigns not by tribute but by provision; the acclamation is not flattery but gratitude. A textual note belongs here: the Masoretic Text lacks a nun-line in the acrostic, but a nun-verse (“Faithful is the LORD in all his words and ḥasid in all his works”) appears in the Septuagint and in a Dead Sea Scroll (11QPs-a). Many modern editions and translations print it (often as v. 13b), and its content dovetails with vv. 17–20. The rabbinic homily that David “saw a fall” in nun (Amos 5:2) and so “supported” it with v. 14 (Berakhot 4b) is a theological reading of what was likely a textual loss; both are worth knowing, the one for philology, the other for wisdom.

Then comes the psalm’s signature turn. After the high claims about eternal kingship (v. 13), the poem pivots to low places: “The LORD supports all who are falling and raises all who are bowed down” (v. 14). The verbs are participles—ongoing action—and their pairing is memorably echoed in the next psalm (Ps 146:8: “The LORD raises up those who are bowed down”). Here is royal theology refitted: the king’s greatness is measured by his upholding of the vulnerable. The feeding lines that follow (vv. 15–16) draw on idioms elsewhere: “The eyes of all look to you” (cf. Ps 104:27) and “You open your hand” (cf. Deut 15:8, the ethical command to “open your hand” to the poor, and Ps 104:28’s depiction of God’s bounty). Psalm 145 applies a human moral obligation to God’s mode of rule: the divine hand is open. The contested noun rāṣōn (v. 16) can denote either “favor” (divine goodwill) or “desire” (creaturely appetite). The LXX’s eudokia leans toward the former; the context sustains both: God’s favor meets each creature’s fitting desire.

The second half (vv. 17–20) recapitulates the moral underpinning of this accessibility. God is ṣaddiq (“righteous”) in all his ways and ḥasid (“faithful/loyal”) in all his works—an unusual application of ḥasid to God (cf. Jer 3:12). Therefore “the LORD is near to all who call on him … in truth” (v. 18): availability meets integrity. The sequence of v. 19 (fulfill desire, hear cry, save) describes comprehensive providence—proactive and responsive. Verse 20 introduces necessary tension: “The LORD guards all who love him, but all the wicked he will destroy.” The hymn’s universalism is not indiscriminate. Mercy “over all his works” does not nullify the reality of wickedness; judgment serves love by removing what corrodes the common good (cf. Mal 3:19 [4:1]).

The final verse returns to the opening “I,” now enlarged by the chorus of “all flesh.” An acrostic that aspires to total praise closes by asking that every living thing bless God’s holy name “forever and ever.” The psalm holds together a theology that is both expansive and exacting: the king of all ages is the God who opens his hand; the provider of every creature’s due is near to the truthful caller; and the universal scope of care does not blur moral distinctions. It is a commonwealth of praise, where sovereignty is recognized in gratitude for sustenance, and the alphabet of praise becomes a grammar of mercy.
