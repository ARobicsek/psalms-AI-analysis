Psalm 145 is the only psalm whose superscription names the piece itself “a tehillah,” a praise. That title is not mere labeling. It signals the psalm’s program: to model praise—its reasons, its reach, and its rhythm—and to gather an individual’s daily benediction into an ever-widening chorus until “all flesh” blesses God’s holy name (v. 21). The poem is an acrostic: each bicolon begins with the next letter of the Hebrew alphabet—an A-to-Z of praise. Alphabetic acrostics in biblical poetry often claim comprehensiveness: here is praise in all its letters. Yet the Masoretic Text lacks a nun (נ) line between v. 13 and v. 14. Ancient and medieval readers noticed; the Greek (LXX) inserts “Faithful is the LORD in all his words, and gracious in all his works,” and a form of this line appears in the Dead Sea Psalms Scroll (11QPs-a). Many medieval manuscripts and Jewish prayerbooks preserve it. Whether original or a deft repair, the nun line states themes central to the psalm—divine fidelity in word and graciousness in deed—and keeps the acrostic whole.

The architecture of the poem is simple and sophisticated at once. Verses 1–2 begin with the “I”: “I will exalt… I will bless.” Verse 3 shifts to declaration: the LORD’s greatness cannot be searched out. Verses 4–7 widen the frame to “generation to generation,” then to “they”—the community—reciting and recounting. At the center of the poem’s theology, vv. 8–9 restate Israel’s creed (Exod 34:6–7) in compressed form: gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, abounding in steadfast love; good to all, with mercy over all his works. Verses 10–13 turn to kingship: all God’s works acknowledge him; his faithful bless him; his rule is everlasting. The second half (vv. 14–20) demonstrates kingship in action: upholding the falling, straightening the bent, feeding every living thing, attending to prayer, guarding those who love him, opposing the wicked. Finally, the psalm returns to the “I”—“my mouth shall speak”—and ends with the universal “all flesh” blessing God’s holy name. The rhetorical movement is deliberate: private resolve becomes public witness becomes cosmic liturgy.

Two equally insistent themes run through the psalm: divine majesty and divine tenderness. This is royalty language reworked within Israel’s theology. Verse 13 pairs malkhut (kingship) with memshalah (dominion), a West Semitic way of naming both the institution and its exercise. The verse’s temporal sweep—“for all ages” and “for every generation”—echoes Near Eastern claims for enduring rule; here it is ascribed to Israel’s God, who sets the calendar of ages. Yet the king of v. 13 is the sustainer of vv. 14–16: he supports all who are falling, raises all who are bowed down, opens his hand, and satisfies every living thing. This is not the ancient stereotype of a capricious divine monarch. Instead, kingship is measured by upholding the vulnerable and provisioning creatures at the right time (v. 15). Israel’s credal adjectives (v. 8) and universal scope (v. 9) anchor this vision: the moral character confessed at Sinai is the character of the ruler of all.

The psalm’s diction for praise is varied and purposeful. It begins with bless (barak) and exalt (romem), moves to laud (shabach; an Aramaizing verb), declare (nagad), recount (safar), praise (halal), thank/acknowledge (yadah), and make known (hodia’). What begins as devotion becomes testimony. The language of glory and splendor—kavod, hod, hadar—clusters in vv. 5, 11–12, describing the radiance of kingship. Parallel lines often reinforce rather than merely repeat; this is a hallmark of Hebrew poetics. For readers, two terms are useful. Parallelism names the pairing of lines that mirror or intensify one another; here, lines often move from general to particular, from attribute to act. Inclusio names the phenomenon of a unit beginning and ending with the same motif; here, “forever and ever” frames the opening (vv. 1–2) and conclusion (v. 21), and praise brackets the whole (the superscription’s tehillah and “the praise of the LORD will my mouth speak”).

Another thread binds the poem: the small word kol, “all.” The psalm speaks of “all” with a kind of liturgical insistence—good to all (v. 9), all his works (vv. 9–10), all ages (v. 13), all who fall and all who are bent (v. 14), the eyes of all (v. 15), every living thing (v. 16), in all his ways and in all his works (v. 17), all who call (v. 18), the desire of those who fear him (v. 19), all who love and all the wicked (v. 20), and “all flesh” (v. 21). As the poem expands from “I” to the cosmos, kol punctuates the reach of both God’s action and the response it elicits.

The psalm does not flatten mercy and justice into a slogan. Verse 9 affirms: the LORD is good to all, with compassion over all his works. Verse 20 says: all the wicked he will destroy. Medieval interpreters already felt the tension. Some distinguished times: mercy now, judgment at the end. The poem suggests a deeper coherence: the same moral reliability that makes provision dependable (vv. 15–16), that hears true prayer (vv. 18–19), and that guards those who love (v. 20a) also opposes what corrodes a just creation (v. 20b). The poem’s triad at the end is instructive: near to all who call “in truth” (v. 18), he fulfills the desire of “those who fear” (v. 19), and he guards “all who love” (v. 20). “Truth,” “fear,” “love”—postures of heart that belong together. The universe of praise is moral as well as musical.

A final note on v. 16: “You open your hand and satisfy every living thing ratzon.” Ratzon can mean “favor” or “good pleasure,” and many render “the desire of every living thing.” The line carries both senses: God’s open hand grants creatures what they need in a way consonant with his gracious will. The image is as intimate as it is imperial: the king rules by opening his hand.

Psalm 145 thus performs what it proclaims. Its acrostic strives for completeness; its verbs escort praise from private resolve to public witness; its royal diction serves mercy; its “all” binds creatures and nations; its last line returns to the first voice and then yields it to “all flesh.” The psalm is not simply about praise. It is itself the architecture by which a single voice enters the larger chorus.
