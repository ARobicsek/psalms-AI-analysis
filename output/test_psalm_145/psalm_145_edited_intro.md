Psalm 145 is the only psalm in the Psalter whose superscription is Tehillah—“a praise.” That singular label does not deny that the other poems praise God; rather, it suggests that this acrostic hymn is a worked exemplar of praise—an A‑to‑Z of how Israel names God’s greatness and lives into it. Its artistry is not ornament. The poem’s alphabetic scaffolding orders the movement from an “I” that vows daily blessing (vv. 1–2), to a “they” that hands on testimony (vv. 4–7), to “all” creation which receives and returns God’s bounty (vv. 9–10, 15–21). The poem is, in short, pedagogy: it trains the tongue, and through the tongue the heart.

The acrostic is complete save for the nun line. Ancient Greek translators, perhaps uneasy with the gap, supplied a line after v. 13: “Faithful is the LORD in his words and holy in all his works.” The Masoretic Text leaves the acrostic imperfect. That imperfection, read literarily, fits the psalm’s own confession: “His greatness—there is no searching it” (v. 3). A rosary of letters cannot exhaust the divine. Whether the gap reflects transmission history or design, the received Hebrew form gives the stanza’s cadence a subtle hitch: completeness stretched by what exceeds it.

Two hinge features govern the poem’s thought. First is a creed: “Gracious and compassionate is the LORD, slow to anger and abundant in steadfast love” (v. 8). Drawn from Exodus 34:6, this fourfold formula is Israel’s center of gravity; here it forms the heart of the acrostic (ח), the pivot from God’s unsearchable greatness (vv. 1–7) to God’s broad goodness and near care (vv. 9–21). Second is a refrain of expansiveness marked by kol, “all”: “The LORD is good to all” (v. 9), “His compassion is over all his works” (v. 9), “All your works shall thank you” (v. 10), “all who are falling,” “all who are bowed down” (v. 14), “the eyes of all” (v. 15), “every living thing” (v. 16), “in all his ways…in all his works” (v. 17), “to all who call…all who call in truth” (v. 18), “the desire of those who fear him,” “all who love him,” “all the wicked” (vv. 19–20), and finally “all flesh” (v. 21). The poem’s rhetoric of “all” is not bland universality; it is carefully contoured by “truth” (v. 18), “fear” and “love” (vv. 19–20), and the reality of judgment (v. 20). But its scope is unmistakably wide.

Psalm 145 resolves a tension often caricatured: if God is King, must divine sovereignty be displayed as domination? Verses 11–13 stack royal vocabulary—“glory of your kingdom,” “the majestic glory of his kingdom,” “your kingdom is a kingdom of all ages; your dominion in every generation.” Such formulae draw on shared royal idiom in Israel’s world, where divine reign is celebrated by permanence and reach. The psalm appropriates that idiom but redefines its content. The true King is recognized not by violence, but by nearness and providence. Immediately after the kingship stanza comes the turn: “The LORD supports all who are falling and straightens all who are bent” (v. 14); “The eyes of all look to you…and you open your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing” (vv. 15–16). The gesture that sums divine rule is an opened hand, not a clenched fist.

Those two images—supporting the falling and opening the hand—concentrate biblical idioms that are worth hearing in their larger register. “Falling” (נפל) is a common Hebrew verb for collapse, defeat, and death. Its use here (v. 14) belongs to a pattern in which God’s care meets creatures in their low estate (cf. Ps 146:8; the idiom “face fell” for dejection in Gen 4:5–6). The “opened hand” in v. 16 draws on the Deuteronomic ethic: “You shall open, yes open your hand to the poor” (Deut 15:8; see also 15:11). Psalm 104:28 already applied that idiom to God—“You open your hand; they are satisfied with good”—and Psalm 145 renews it. Israel’s social instruction is not a mere humanism; it mirrors divine practice.

The poem’s figuration of praise is equally tactile. In v. 7 the verb נבע (“to bubble up, gush”) describes speech as a spring: “They will cause the remembrance of your abundant goodness to gush forth.” Elsewhere this same verb depicts creation’s wordless proclamation (Ps 19:3: “Day to day pours forth speech”), a sage’s instruction (Ps 78:2), or the wicked’s insolence (Ps 94:4). The metaphor is chosen to insist that praise is not a performance but an artesian response: what God pours out returns in kind.

Finally, the psalm’s end makes explicit what its beginning only intimated. It starts in the first person—“I will extol… I will bless”—and closes with a wide summons: “Let all flesh bless his holy name forever and ever” (v. 21). “All flesh” is a deliberately capacious phrase; it gathers not only Israel or “sons of man” (v. 12) but the living order. The logic is consistent: if “his compassion is over all his works” (v. 9), then “all his works” answer in thanksgiving (v. 10), “the eyes of all” wait (v. 15), and “all flesh” blesses (v. 21). The psalm thus teaches not only what to say about God, but how the saying enlarges the speaker, drawing the solitary voice into a chorus. It is indeed a praise—singular—composed to make many.
