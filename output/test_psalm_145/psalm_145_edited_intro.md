Psalm 145 is the sole psalm titled “tehillah”—a praise—though the collection as a whole is called Tehillim. That singular label invites the reader to consider this poem as a crafted summa of praise: not an anthology of topics, but a systematic enactment of praise as speech, memory, and communal practice. The structure itself becomes part of the theology. The poem is an alphabetic acrostic (one verse for each Hebrew letter), a device that belongs to wisdom’s pedagogy and to liturgical ordering. Here, the acrostic does double duty. It trains the mouth—“my mouth shall speak” (v.21)—to traverse the A–Z of praise, and it signals wholeness: from aleph to tav, God’s reign and care encompass all.

The acrostic is almost complete. The nun-verse is absent from the received Hebrew text (between vv.13 and 14); the ancient Greek (LXX) supplies a line—“Faithful is the LORD in all his words and holy in all his works”—and that line appears in some medieval Hebrew manuscripts and in Jewish liturgy (Ashrei). Whether the nun dropped out or was never written is unprovable; the point is what the poem does with the near-completeness we have. The poem builds a totality of praise through many other devices: an inclusio frames the whole with “forever and ever” (vv.1–2, 21); the refrain of “all” (kol) proliferates across the second half (vv.9–10, 13–16, 20–21); and the voice moves from “I” to “they” to “all flesh.” The acrostic is not a decoration but a scaffold for a comprehensive argument: praise begins as personal vow and overflows into communal witness and universal blessing.

The psalm’s outline is clear. Verses 1–3 vow daily, lifelong praise and confess God’s unsearchable greatness. Verses 4–7 envision the transmission of that confession “generation to generation,” through acts of recollection and instruction: works and mighty deeds recited, “wonders” meditated upon, praise that “gushes forth.” At the center (v.8) stands the fourfold mercy formula (“gracious and compassionate… slow to anger… abounding in steadfast love”), the classic confession from Exodus 34:6. That line functions as the psalm’s theological hinge. The poem does not merely celebrate divine might; it insists that God’s character—mercy, patience, loyalty—grounds the totality of praise.

From there the poem expands. Verses 9–13 stretch compassion beyond Israel: “good to all” and “mercies over all his works” (v.9). The royal vocabulary then comes to the fore (vv.10–13): “glory of your kingdom” (kavod malkhutekha), “your dominion” (mimshaltkha), “a kingdom of all ages.” The formula “your kingdom is a kingdom of all ages, and your dominion in every generation” (v.13) resonates with Ancient Near Eastern royal idioms (Ugaritic texts speak of mlk ʿlm, an “eternal king”), yet Psalm 145 uses that language to do two distinct things. First, it reframes royal power as divine, not human, authority: the LORD’s reign extends through time (all ages) and through the succession of human history (“generation and generation”). Second—and here the poem parts company with ancient claims of kingship—the rhetoric pivots immediately to care for the vulnerable.

Verses 14–16 move from throne to hand. The King “supports all who fall” and “straightens all who are bent” (v.14), the “eyes of all” look toward him in hope (v.15), and he “opens [his] hand” to satisfy every living thing (v.16). These are not generalized pieties. Each image is part of a scriptural lexicon. “Falling” and being lifted (נפל/זקף) recur in contexts of human frailty and divine help (e.g., Ps 37:24; 146:8). “Eyes of all” as a figure for creaturely dependence is a staple of creation praise (Ps 104:27; cf. Ps 123:2). And the “open hand” is a covenantal idiom for generosity in Deuteronomy (15:8, 11), daringly applied here to God himself (cf. Ps 104:28). Psalm 145 gathers these figures into royal theology: true sovereignty is not distance but provision, not extraction but gift.

The closing section (vv.17–20) tightens the moral lines. God is “righteous in all his ways and faithful/holy [ḥasid] in all his works” (v.17). Nearness is offered “to all who call… in truth” (v.18); God fulfills desire, hears the cry, saves (v.19). Then the psalm articulates judgment without apology: “The LORD guards all who love him, but all the wicked he will destroy” (v.20). The earlier universal mercy (v.9) is not undone; it is focused. There is a distinction between general providence (“good to all”) and protective governance (“guards all who love”). The poem moves through a series of relational terms—those who call (v.18), who fear (v.19), who love (v.20)—that mark degrees of response to the offered nearness. Universal generosity does not mean moral indifference.

Finally, the psalm closes with a miniature of its entire movement (v.21): “My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD; and let all flesh bless his holy name forever and ever.” The private vow becomes a universal summons. “All flesh” (cf. Ps 65:3; Isa 40:5) signals creation-wide worship, and “holy name” remembers that divine nearness does not cancel divine otherness. Praise, here, is not mere emotion but a craft of memory and speech, an intergenerational discipline that reforms political imagination: the world belongs to a King whose eternal reign takes visible form in an open hand.
