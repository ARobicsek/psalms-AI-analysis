# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 145

The draft has real strengths. It rightly foregrounds the psalm’s unique superscription (tehillah), the acrostic architecture, the movement from the “I” of v. 1 to “all flesh” in v. 21, and the seam between transcendence (kingship) and immanence (provision). It tracks key Hebrew verbs of praise, and it notices the strategic reappearance of classic creed language (Exod 34:6–7) in vv. 8–9 and the moral tension between divine mercy (v. 9) and judgment (v. 20).

Several revisions are needed. A few grammatical points require correction or tightening (e.g., ארוממך is better treated as the Piel “I will exalt,” not “polel”). The claim that v. 13 “shares virtually identical language with Ugaritic” overstates the case; the verse resonates with West Semitic royal idiom but should be framed more cautiously. Most importantly, the acrostic’s missing nun (נ) line deserves fuller treatment: the Septuagint’s addition (v. 13a) has early support in the Dead Sea Psalms Scroll, and many medieval witnesses and liturgical traditions preserve it.

The verse notes commonly label parallelism types without showing what the lines do poetically. Sound, cadence, and “kol/all” saturation (vv. 9–21) merit closer attention. Aramaizing forms (e.g., שׂבר “hope” in v. 15; שׁבח “praise” in v. 4) can be marshaled carefully as compositional clues. The figurative economy (open hand; bent/raised bodies; eyes looking; nearness conditioned by “truth”) can be unpacked with more nuance, and the triad in vv. 18–20 (call in truth, fear, love) can be shown to structure the psalm’s ethics of access.

Unanswered but answerable questions include: the textual status and function of the nun verse; how malkhut/memshalah (kingship/dominion) and hod/hadar/kavod (splendor/majesty/glory) work as a semantic field; what “ratzon” in v. 16 means in context; and how the “kol/all” refrain orchestrates scope and audience. Addressing these will strengthen both the introduction and the verse-by-verse analysis.
