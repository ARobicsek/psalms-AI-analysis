# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 145

What works well: The introduction rightly highlights the psalm’s unusual title (tehillah), the acrostic frame, the “kol/all” motif, and the theological tension between universal mercy (v. 9) and judgment (v. 20). The verse notes show a commendable sensitivity to Hebrew diction (e.g., hadar–kavod–hod; yabbî‘u) and the intergenerational arc (“dor le-dor”). Several good instincts appear: distinguishing ma‘aseh/gevurot/nifla’ot, identifying the Exod 34:6 creed, and noticing the oscillation between singular and plural speakers.

Main weaknesses: There are a few factual/stem errors and overstatements. Most notably, “aromimkha” is not “causative stem” (Hiphil); it is Piel (“I will exalt you”). Claims about exact Ugaritic parallels in v. 13 are too strong; better to speak of broadly shared royal idiom. The exact count for kol (“no fewer than sixteen”) is precarious; say “some fifteen” or analyze selectively. A number of phonetic asides are impressionistic rather than text-grounded. Verse 6’s Qere/Ketiv is noted but not explained. The LXX-plus line in v. 13 is flagged but without the now-crucial DSS evidence; modern readers expect mention that the “nun” line is attested in Hebrew (11QPsa and some medieval MSS) and explains the acrostic gap.

Missed opportunities: Figurative-language parallels could be leveraged more incisively: v. 16 (“open hand”) should be read against Deut 15:8, 11; v. 15 with Ps 104:27; “erekh appayim” with Exod 34:6; “falling/bent” with Ps 146:8. The commentary often gestures at sound but rarely demonstrates distinctive word-music in this psalm. The macro-structure (I → they → all → all flesh) could be clarified and linked to the repeated kol. The relation of malkhut/memshalah could be sharpened.

Actionable revisions: Correct stem/grammar; temper ANE claims; integrate textual criticism of v. 13 (LXX and DSS); give comparative figurative citations; tighten poetics (parallelism types, inclusio); explain unusual Hebrew collocations (e.g., hadar kavod hod; ‘ezuz nora’otekha). Answerable questions: the nun verse, the taxonomy of divine acts, the function of “in truth” (v. 18), and whether “kol basar” is human-only or more capacious. Overall tone should be measured and precise, showcasing analysis rather than superlatives.
