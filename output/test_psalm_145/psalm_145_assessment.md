# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 145

What works: The draft rightly foregrounds Psalm 145’s acrostic design, its movement from individual vow to universal chorus, and the centrality of the Exodus 34:6 formula in v. 8. The commentary is attentive to lexicon (BDB), tracks the “kol/all” motif, and treats signal idioms (“open your hand,” “gush forth”) with some sensitivity. Several verses usefully juxtapose community proclamation with personal testimony (e.g., v. 6), and the interplay of kingship vocabulary in vv. 11–13 is well noticed.

Main weaknesses: The style is sometimes breathless and declarative where demonstration would suffice. A few claims overreach the evidence (e.g., “exact” Ugaritic parallels to v. 13) and treat the missing nun as a “strategic silence” without weighing alternative explanations. Sound analysis leans on idiosyncratic phonetic transcriptions without carefully linking observed patterns to the Hebrew text. Figurative language comparisons are sometimes asserted rather than anchored with specific biblical parallels and usage patterns. The LXX addition at v. 13 is noted but not fully integrated into the acrostic question. Occasional terminological imprecision appears (e.g., reading v. 17 as “beneficent” instead of the clearer “righteous/just” and “faithful/loyal”).

Missed opportunities: The psalm’s “kol/all” refrain could be tracked more systematically as a structuring device from v. 9 through v. 21. The “gushing” verb נבע (v. 7) and the “opened hand” idiom (v. 16) invite specific cross-references (Ps 19:3; 78:2; 94:4; Deut 15:8, 11; Ps 104:28) and pattern analysis. The personification of “all your works” (v. 10) merits comparison to Psalm 148. The acrostic’s missing nun should be set alongside the LXX’s supplied line and the rhetorical effect of the MT’s gap. The fear/love pairing (vv. 19–20) could be read as a deliberate progression and attached to v. 18’s “truth.”

Answerable questions: The Macro/Micro prompts about the acrostic gap, royal formulae, the shift from kingship to care (vv. 14–16), the role of “truth” (v. 18), and fear/love (vv. 19–20) can be addressed from the bundle. The unusual triple construct in v. 12 (“כבוד הדר מלכותו”) and the triple “glory” cluster in v. 5 deserve careful exposition.

Figurative language: Several parallels are noted, but the draft seldom cites specific texts by book/chapter/verse or analyzes frequency and typical context. The revision below adds concrete citations and comparative patterns and shows how this psalm’s usage is distinctive.
