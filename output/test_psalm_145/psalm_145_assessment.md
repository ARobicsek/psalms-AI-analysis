# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 145

What works: The draft rightly grasps the psalm’s arc—from “my God the King” to “all flesh”—and sees that Psalm 145 measures kingship by mercy and provision as much as by power. Many lexical notes (e.g., on נבע “to gush,” and the stack of glory terms in v.5) are on point. The commentary often notices structural cues (generations, universality, the inclusio with “forever and ever”), and it attends to the LXX’s nun-line addition at v.13.

What needs revision: The tone is at times breathless and evaluative instead of demonstrating claims through analysis. Some phonetic and stylistic micro-observations feel overdone relative to their payoff. Several opportunities to anchor figurative language in Scripture-wide usage are missed or only vaguely referenced. The Ugaritic parallel to v.13 is cited but not integrated into the psalm’s argument. The “missing nun” discussion needs a balanced textual note, including the LXX line and its presence in some Hebrew manuscripts and later liturgy. The introduction could better explain acrostic design and liturgical reception (Ashrei) without romanticizing intentions (e.g., that the missing nun is “theological precision”). The commentary sometimes blurs Eloah/Elohim/Elohai and overstates “Elohim” in v.1 (the form is “my God,” Elohai). Some verses (e.g., vv.11–13, vv.15–16) deserve deeper comparative work: “open hand” (Deut 15:8, 11; Ps 104:28), “eyes of all” (Ps 104:27; Ps 123:2), “gush” (Ps 19:3; 78:2; 94:4; 119:171; Prov 18:4), “fall” (Ps 37:24; 146:8). The justice/mercy tension (vv.9, 20) is noted but could be clarified through biblical patterns.

Answerable questions to address: (1) The function of the acrostic and its nun-line in transmission (LXX; later Hebrew MSS; liturgical Ashrei); (2) the role of “be’emet” (v.18); (3) how “fearers” (v.19) relate to “lovers” (v.20); (4) the rhetorical turn from kingship (vv.10–13) to care (vv.14–16) and its ANE resonance/contrast; (5) how “hadar/kavod/hod” (v.5) and “’oz/‘ezuz” (vv.6, 68:35) operate as a paired royal lexicon.

Figurative language: The draft rightly highlights “gush” and “open hand” but should cite concrete parallels with usage patterns and show how Psalm 145 adapts these figures (e.g., human generosity → divine providence; Deut 15:8, 11 → Ps 145:16). It should also situate “all flesh” (Ps 65:3; Isa 40:5) within a biblical horizon of universal worship.

The revision below strengthens argument, diction, and textual grounding; integrates comparative data; and replaces evaluative superlatives with close reading.
