# Editorial Assessment - Psalm 145

What works: The draft rightly foregrounds Psalm 145’s unique title (tehillah), its acrostic form, and its movement from “I” to “all.” It perceptively tracks the psalm’s rhetorical expansion and links the royal claims (vv. 11–13) to the caregiving center (vv. 14–16). It also observes the semantic force of verbs such as yabbīʿū (“gush forth,” v. 7) and the anthropomorphic “open Your hand” (v. 16), and it draws on classical Jewish commentators to good effect.

What needs revision: A few factual slips undermine confidence. The claim that עֱזוּז (ʿezūz) is a hapax is incorrect (see Psalm 24:8). “Dor le-dor” does not occur only twice in Scripture; the idiom of “generation to generation” (with small variations) is frequent (e.g., Ps 79:13; 89:2; 90:1; Isa 34:10). The missing nun needs fuller textual discussion: the nun-line is preserved in the LXX and in a Qumran manuscript (11QPs-a), likely reflecting an earlier Hebrew Vorlage, and many modern editions print it. The Baal Cycle parallel should be presented more cautiously as shared ANE royal idiom rather than a direct quotation. Stylistically, some diction is breathless; the argument is strong enough to stand without superlatives.

Missed opportunities: The drumbeat of kol (“all”) deserves quantitative notice as a structuring device. The reception-history of this psalm (central to Ashrei, Berakhot 4b) illuminates why its acrostic and v. 16’s provision became liturgically determinative. The psalm’s network of intertexts—Job 5:9/Isa 40:28 for “unsearchable,” Ps 19:3 and 78:2 for “pouring forth,” Deut 15:8 and Ps 104:28 for “open hand”—should be explicitly cited, with patterns noted. The immediate canonical echo in Ps 146:8 (“the LORD raises up the bowed down”) strengthens the thematic turn in v. 14.

Answerable questions: The acrostic’s missing nun (addressed by LXX/Qumran), the double sense of rāṣōn (v. 16) as “favor/desire” (LXX: eudokia), and the rationale for v. 20’s judgment within a universal hymn can all be resolved within the provided materials. Several unusual Hebrew clusters—hădar kevod hodekha (v. 5), ʿezūz noraʾotekha (v. 6)—merit tighter lexical and poetic analysis.

Figurative language: The draft identifies metaphors but often without concrete parallels. Stronger analysis will cite specific texts (e.g., Ps 19:3; 78:2; 94:4 for yabbīʿū; Deut 15:8 and Ps 104:28 for “open hand”), describe frequency and typical contexts, and then show how Ps 145’s uses are distinctive (e.g., transposing an ethical idiom of human generosity to God’s cosmic hospitality).
