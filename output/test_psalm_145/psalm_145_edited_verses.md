Note on structure: Psalm 145 is an alphabetic acrostic; the Masoretic Text lacks a nun line between v. 13 and v. 14. The Septuagint preserves a corresponding bicolon, and it is attested in Hebrew at Qumran (11QPsa). Many modern editions print it as v. 13b. Where relevant, this note is integrated below.

**Verse 1**
The unique title tehillah (“song of praise”) signals the poem’s agenda. “I will exalt you” (’aromimkha) is Piel 1cs (“I will extol”), not Hiphil; the stem matters because Piel here denotes intensive action rather than mere causation. The address fuses intimacy and majesty: “my God, the king.” Personal pronoun and royal title share the same breath. The closing “forever and ever” (le‘olam va‘ed) will reappear in v. 2 and v. 21, creating an inclusio—an envelope that frames the psalm’s temporal sweep. The opening parallelism is synthetic (“A is so, and what’s more, B”): extolling (first colon) expands into blessing the divine name (second colon), with “name” functioning as the locus of presence (cf. Exod 20:24). The psalm’s first move, then, is a vow of disciplined praise, daily (v. 2) and perpetual, whose object is “my God the king”—the key that will unlock the psalm’s royal idiom.

**Verse 2**
“Every day” (bekhol yom) marks praise as a practice rather than a mood. The two verbs—“I will bless … and I will praise”—form a near-synonymous pair, the second heightening the first. The repeated “forever and ever” underscores a rhetorical contrast between the finite daily unit and endless duration: the poet’s ordinary time is yoked to God’s eternity. The “name” is again the direct object of blessing and praise, reminding readers that in the Hebrew Bible to bless/praise God’s name is to acknowledge and align with God’s self-disclosure. The theological move is quiet and decisive: cosmic kingship (v. 1) is met first by daily fidelity. Later expansions (“all your works,” “all flesh”) grow out of this root.

**Verse 3**
“Great is the LORD and much praised” (mehullal me’od) uses the passive participle (“praised”) to present praise as a reality already occurring: God is one to whom praise properly accrues. The second colon sets the epistemic boundary: “and of his greatness there is no searching” (’ein heqer). Heqer elsewhere marks the limit of human inquiry (Job 5:9; 9:10; Isa 40:28). Parallelism here is antithetic-complementary: the more God’s greatness is praised, the more it is confessed unsearchable. The line supplies the poem’s governing posture: praise is what one speaks at the edge of what one can know. This epistemic humility justifies the subsequent turn to what can be told: works, mighty acts, wonders.

**Verse 4**
“Generation to generation” (dor le-dor) relocates praise in time and memory. Two verbs articulate the pedagogy: yeshabbach (“shall laud/praise”) and yaggidu (“shall recount/declare”). The objects are distinct: “your works” (often creation) and “your mighty acts” (historical interventions). The second colon sharpens the first: praise is not only acclamation but narration—a telling of God’s acts that transmits identity and hope. The shift from “I” (vv. 1–2) to “they” (“one generation … another”) marks the widening circle that will characterize the psalm. The “A is so, and what’s more, B” dynamic is clear: acclamation (first colon) moves into instruction (second colon).

**Verse 5**
“Hadar kevod hodekha” (the splendour of the glory of your majesty) piles three near-synonyms, each with its nuance: hadar (splendour/ornament), kavod (weighty glory/presence), hod (majestic splendour). The assonance and semantic clustering create a verbal aureole around the king. The speaker returns to the first person—’asicha, “I will meditate/recite”—and adds a new object: “the words/matter of your wonders” (nifla’otekha). The verb siach denotes murmuring contemplation or spoken meditation (cf. Ps 119:15). This verse models praise as attention: dwelling on attributes (hadar–kavod–hod) and rehearsing deeds (nifla’ot). The inward act (meditation) is the bridge between the received tradition (v. 4) and the public storytelling that follows (v. 6).

**Verse 6**
The first colon, “And they shall speak of the might of your awesome deeds,” introduces ‘ezuz (“might”) and nora’ot (“awesome deeds,” fear-inducing acts). The second colon, “and your (qere) greatness I will recount,” exhibits a Qere/Ketiv variation: the Ketiv (written) form is “your great deeds” (ugedolotekha), the Qere (read) is “your greatness” (ugedullatekha). Either way, the thought balances communal witness (“they shall say”) and personal testimony (“I will recount”). The grammar produces “oscillating voice,” a hallmark of Hebrew poetry that invites readers into both registers. The verse completes a taxonomy now spanning works, mighty acts, wonders, and awesome deeds. The rhetorical effect is accumulation: no register of God’s activity falls outside praise.

**Verse 7**
“Zekher rav-tuvkha yabbî‘u” is arresting. The verb nava‘ literally means “bubble up” or “gush” (cf. Prov 18:4; Ps 19:2); here it conveys abundant, irrepressible speech—the memory of God’s great goodness overflows the banks of ordinary language. The parallel colon “and of your righteousness they will sing for joy” (yeranenu, from ranan, exuberant singing) couples ethical predicate (“righteousness”) with public song. Figurative patterning is strong: speech as spring (yabbî‘u) and praise as song (yeranenu). The vehicle’s biblical pattern is consistent: nava‘ often describes speech that pours out, for good or ill (Prov 15:2; Ps 94:4). Here Psalm 145 joins that usage but ties the effusion specifically to zekher (“memorial/remembrance”): liturgical recollection makes goodness present and prolific.

**Verse 8**
The psalm now cites Israel’s classic confession (Exod 34:6; cf. Num 14:18; Ps 86:15; 103:8): “gracious and compassionate is the LORD, slow to anger and great in steadfast love.” ’Erekh ’appayim is a bodily idiom: long nostrils as a metaphor for slow anger. “Abounding in hesed” (steadfast love/loyalty) keeps covenant vocabulary in view. Functionally this verse is a keystone: the following line (v. 9) will extend these attributes beyond Israel, and the closing section (vv. 17–20) will test their moral contours in prayer’s lived world.

**Verse 9**
“Tov YHWH la-kol” (“The LORD is good to all”) universalizes v. 8’s covenant predicates. “His compassions are over all his works” mirrors the earlier taxonomy (“works” now as the scope of care). The repetition of kol (“all”) thickens: in vv. 9–21 “all” becomes the drumbeat of the psalm’s universality. The tension within the psalm is now intelligible: universal mercy (vv. 8–9) stands with moral judgment (v. 20). Classical Jewish interpreters already wrestled this knot. Malbim and Meiri insist that God’s benevolence embraces even the wicked (as creatures) and the non-human world (as God’s works). The psalm leaves the paradox in place, trusting divine kingship to hold together compassion and justice.

**Verse 10**
“All your works shall give you thanks, O LORD” envisions creation itself as responsive (cf. Ps 148). The Hiphil of yadah often means public acknowledgment. In parallel, “your hasidim shall bless you” names the faithful: those who practice steadfast loyalty in return for God’s hesed. The structure is a two-choir antiphon: creation as a whole and the covenant community. The divine name (YHWH) is placed between them, as though to stand amid and receive the converging acclamation. Praise is both cosmic and covenantal; Psalm 145 refuses to choose.

**Verse 11**
“Of the glory of your kingdom they will speak, and of your might they will tell.” “Kingdom” (malkhut) enters here as the psalm’s organizing metaphor. The speech verbs (“say”/“speak”) suggest unforced conversation rather than coerced acclaim: divine kingship, unlike ancient imperial propaganda, becomes a topic of delighted speech. The pairing malkhut/gevurah aligns rule and capacity. The parallelism is stair-step: the first colon’s general “glory” of rule is specified by the second colon’s “might” that underwrites it.

**Verse 12**
The infinitive “to make known” (lehodi‘a) gives the purpose of the preceding conversation: instruction directed “to the children of humanity” (livnei ha’adam). The scope is explicitly universal, not tribal. The line’s three nouns—“his mighty acts,” “the glory,” “the splendour of his kingdom”—let the poet braid ethics and aesthetics: governance characterized by might and by beauty. Praise is didactic here; it renders divine kingship intelligible in the public square.

**Verse 13 (MT)**
“Your kingdom is a kingdom of all ages, and your dominion in every generation and generation.” The doublet malkhut/memshalah probably distinguishes realm (the sphere of rule) from reigning (the exercise of rule). The phrases “all ages” (kol ‘olamim) and “every generation” create a temporal merism: God’s rule is not episodic. This is stock royal idiom across the ancient Near East; Psalm 145 adopts it unapologetically and then redefines its content through vv. 14–16’s care for the weak.

**Verse 13b (nun verse; LXX, DSS)**
“Faithful is the LORD in all his words, and gracious (or: loyal) in all his works.” This line—now often printed—restores the acrostic’s nun and anticipates v. 17’s close parallel (“righteous … faithful”). It also bridges the two halves: from eternal kingship (v. 13a) to concrete support (v. 14). The repetition of “in all … in all” keeps the kol-cadence in our ears.

**Verse 14**
“The LORD supports all who are falling, and raises up all who are bent.” The participles (supporting, straightening) portray ongoing action. “Falling” and “bent” are physical images that readily extend to social and psychological states. Elsewhere “fall” can euphemize death (Exod 32:28), but here the point is sustenance before collapse. The verb “raise/straighten” (zokef) also appears in Ps 146:8 (“the LORD raises those who are bowed down”), linking the two psalms’ royal-providence theme. The universality (“all”) repeats: kingship shows itself not merely in cosmic grandeur but in action for the vulnerable.

**Verse 15**
“The eyes of all look to you in hope, and you give them their food in its time.” The verb sabar (Aramaism) means to hope/wait and appears in Ps 104:27 with the same image: creatures wait for their food “in due season.” The phrase “in its time” answers the experience of delay: providence is timely, not on-demand. The merism between “all eyes” and “their food” grounds theology in biology—God’s reign is measured not only by history’s turning points but by daily bread. The pairing with v. 16 (“open hand”) is deliberate: expectation (v. 15) meets generosity (v. 16).

**Verse 16**
“You open your hand and satisfy every living thing [with] ratzon.” The idiom “open your hand” is a hallmark of Israel’s ethics (Deut 15:8, 11); Psalm 145 daringly transposes it to God, portraying royal rule as generosity. Ratzon can mean “desire” or “favour/what is fitting.” The Septuagint’s eudokia leans toward God’s favourable goodwill rather than unfiltered creaturely want. Either way, the verb “satisfy” (masbi‘a) is emphatic: the gesture is not minimum subsistence but fullness. Figuratively, this line functions as the psalm’s emblem: dominion exercised by open-handed provision. Compared with the broader figurative pattern (open hand as generosity in Deut 15), Psalm 145’s distinctive note is cosmic scope: what Israel is commanded to be, God is—toward “every living thing.”

**Verse 17**
“Righteous is the LORD in all his ways, and faithful/loyal in all his works.” The pairing tsaddiq/hasid fuses moral rectitude and covenantal loyalty. The double “in all” (bekhol … bekhol) participates in the psalm’s anaphora of kol. This line overlaps strongly with the nun verse (v. 13b), forming a brace around vv. 14–16’s providence. Theologically the claim is comprehensive and bracing: both method (“ways”) and outcomes (“works”) accord with God’s righteousness and loyalty, including when provision feels delayed (v. 15).

**Verse 18**
“Near is the LORD to all who call upon him—to all who call upon him in truth.” Nearness is universal, the condition relational: “in truth” (be’emet). Hebrew ’emet carries the sense of integrity and reliability. The phrase can qualify the caller (“sincerely”) and, by extension, the encounter (God meets genuine calling in a way that is true). The verse expands the earlier “all”: it is not ethnicity but authenticity that matters. The temple prayer for foreigners in 1 Kgs 8:41–43 is a canonical parallel: those who call, though strangers, are heard.

**Verse 19**
“He does the desire of those who fear him; he hears their cry and saves them.” A three-beat progression structures the line: desire → cry → salvation. “Those who fear him” is a wisdom term denoting reverent allegiance, not terror. The verbs are simple and stacked (he will do/hear/save), the last (yoshi‘em, Hiphil) marking decisive causative rescue. This verse complements v. 18: nearness (to all who call truly) issues in attentive response (to those who fear).

**Verse 20**
“The LORD guards all who love him, but all the wicked he will destroy.” This is the psalm’s only explicit antithetic parallelism. The symmetry of “all … all” intensifies the moral contrast: love versus wickedness, preservation versus destruction. The verb “guard” (shomer) suggests ongoing protection; “destroy” (yashmid, Hiphil) signals active judgment. Here the tension with v. 9 is plain; the psalm does not reconcile it by rhetoric. Traditional readings (Ibn Ezra, Radak) either defer the destruction to an ultimate horizon or construe God’s goodness as long-suffering until repentance. Poetically, the line functions as the psalm’s moral boundary: universal mercy does not erase moral order.

**Verse 21**
“My mouth will speak the praise of the LORD, and all flesh will bless his holy name forever and ever.” The conclusion returns to the singular “my mouth” and then releases it into “all flesh.” “All flesh” typically denotes all living creatures (cf. Isa 66:23), though some medieval commentators restrict it to humanity; the phrase’s normal biblical range invites the broader reading here, especially in light of vv. 15–16’s zoology of dependence. The “holy name” returns the poem to the “name” blessed at the start, and “forever and ever” closes the inclusio begun in vv. 1–2. This is “catalytic conclusion”: the individual vow that began the psalm is now imagined as the seed from which the chorus of the living grows.

Addendum on structure and text: Reading the nun verse (v. 13b) restores the acrostic and creates a smooth bridge from eternal kingship (v. 13a) to providential care (v. 14) by asserting God’s faithfulness “in all his words” and loyalty “in all his works.” Even without it, v. 17 supplies the same confession, perhaps twice for emphasis. In both forms, the psalm’s architecture is clear: personal discipline gives way to intergenerational teaching, which broadens to universal kingship and concrete care, culminating in a vision where “all flesh” blesses the Name that opens its hand.
