Note on the acrostic and textual history: Psalm 145 is an alphabetic acrostic. The nun-line is absent in the MT but present in the LXX and 11QPs-a (11Q5): “נֶאֱמָן יְהוָה בְּכָל דְּבָרָיו וְחָסִיד בְּכָל מַעֲשָׂיו” (“Faithful is the LORD in all his words and ḥasid in all his works”). Many modern editions include it as v. 13b. Rabbinic tradition saw theological meaning in the absence (Berakhot 4b), but the textual evidence points to an ancient full acrostic.

Verse 1
“Tehillah of David.” This lone superscription signals content: an unbroken hymn. The opening clause, “I will exalt you, my God, the king,” pairs elohai (“my God”) with hamelekh (“the king”), a juxtaposition that fuses intimacy and sovereignty. The verb ʾaromimkha (from r-w-m, “to raise/exalt”) often marks liturgical acclaim (Exod 15:2; Ps 30:2). “Bless your name” draws on the biblical idiom in which “name” stands for character and reputation; to “bless” it is to voice gratitude and acknowledgment. The temporal frame—“forever and ever”—forms an inclusio with v. 21 and, with “every day” in v. 2, balances the ordinary with the perpetual. The verse sets the psalm’s arc: personal vow as the seed of a universal chorus.

Verse 2
“Every day” (bekhol-yom) turns praise into habit rather than occasion. The two verbs—“I will bless … and I will praise”—are complementary: berakhah (blessing) accents gratitude, while hillēl (praise) leans toward public acclamation. The repetition of “forever and ever” knits daily rhythm to eschatological scope. The verse proposes a liturgical anthropology: praise is not episodic; it is a way of keeping time.

Verse 3
“Great … and greatly praised.” The near-figure: gādōl/gĕdullāh creates a sonic emphasis on magnitude. “His greatness is unsearchable” (ʾēn ḥēqer) belongs to a recurring idiom for the divine’s unfathomable range (Job 5:9; 9:10; Isa 40:28). In Psalm 145 this confession is a hinge: it both humbles and energizes praise. The impossibility of exhaustive measurement keeps speech flowing from generation to generation; the ocean is never sounded.

Verse 4
“Generation to generation” (dor le-dor) is a biblical way to talk about continuity (cf. Ps 79:13; 89:2; 90:1; Isa 34:10). The verbs vary praise’s mode: yeshabbaḥ (“laud/praise”), yaggīdū (“declare, tell”). The objects vary too: God’s maʿasim (“works,” creative/providential) and gĕvurot (“mighty acts,” often redemptive interventions; cf. Exod 15:6; Ps 106:2). Praise is pedagogical: testimony, not mere feeling.

Verse 5
The construct chain—hădar kevod hodekha—heaps three glory-terms: hădar (splendor), kavod (weight/glory), hod (majesty/vigor). Such clustering is rare and deliberate (cf. Ps 96:6; 104:1). The first person returns: “I will meditate/recite” (ʾāsīḥā, from ś-y-ḥ), a verb that can mean musing aloud (cf. Ps 119:15). The object, niplʾotekha (“wondrous deeds”), typically names acts that exceed ordinary causation and mark divine agency. Public proclamation rests on private rumination.

Verse 6
“Power of your awesome deeds” (ʿezūz noraʾotekha) yokes a noun of might (ʿezūz; cf. Ps 24:8: “the LORD strong [ʿizzūz] and mighty”) with “awesome things” (noraʾot), a frequent marker of the fearsome element in salvation history. The alternation “they will speak … I will recount” choreographs communal and individual witness. The verb “recount” (sipper) implies enumeration; praise is willing to be specific, to number mercies.

Verse 7
“They will gush forth the memorial of your abundant goodness.” The verb yabbīʿū (from n-b-ʿ) usually describes liquid springing forth; when applied to speech it casts testimony as an outflow. This metaphor appears elsewhere: “Day to day pours forth speech” (Ps 19:3); “I will pour forth riddles” (Ps 78:2); “they pour forth insolence” (Ps 94:4). The pattern is frequent in sapiential and praise contexts, often contrasting restrained wise speech with the torrent of the wicked. Here it marks abundance: goodness overflows in remembered report. The parallel colon—“they shall sing of your righteousness”—balances cognitive “memorial” with celebratory song.

Verse 8
A citation of Exod 34:6, the fountainhead of Israel’s creed: “gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, and abounding in ḥesed.” The four terms span favor (ḥannūn), parental compassion (raḥūm), patience (ʾerekh appayim, literally “long of nostrils”), and covenant love (rav ḥesed). Within Psalm 145 the citation’s weight is doubled by what follows.

Verse 9
“The LORD is good to all, and his mercies are over all his works.” The double kol universalizes the attributes just named. “Over” (ʿal) casts mercy as an atmosphere or covering. The plural “mercies” implies multiple manifestations. Traditional Jewish commentators already drew ethical conclusions: if mercy extends to all creatures, human conduct should mirror it. The psalm thus moves from covenant theology to creation theology without abandoning either.

Verse 10
“All your works shall thank you … and your ḥasidim shall bless you.” Creation’s personification is biblically familiar (Ps 98:8; Isa 55:12), but the two-choir structure is distinctive: the whole created order expresses gratitude by being itself in harmonious order; the faithful (ḥasidim) add articulate blessing. Two verbs—yōdū (give thanks/confess) and yĕvarekhū (bless)—suggest spontaneity and intention. The verse is a hinge between universal scope and covenant community.

Verse 11
“They shall speak of the glory of your kingship, and talk of your might.” “Kingship” (malkhūt) paired with “glory” recasts sovereignty as radiant stability rather than mere force. The two speech-verbs (yōmerū / yĕdabberū) shade from simple saying to discursive explanation. Praise here becomes public theology.

Verse 12
“To make known to the sons of Adam his mighty deeds, and the glorious majesty of his kingship.” The audience is now universal humanity (livnē hāʾādām). The phrase “glory of the splendor of his kingship” reprises v. 5’s cluster but applies it to rule. Kingship in this psalm seeks publicity—missionary monarchy, if one may call it that—because it is good news about providence, not a threat of domination.

Verse 13 (MT) 
“Your kingship is a kingship for all ages, and your dominion in every generation.” The formula is standard royal diction in the ANE, turned toward YHWH. “Kingship” (malkhūt) speaks of realm; “dominion” (memshalah) of active governance. “All ages … every generation” pairs cosmic and historical time. 

Verse 13b (LXX/11QPs-a; probable original nun)
“Faithful is the LORD in all his words and ḥasid in all his works.” The line rounds out the acrostic and anticipates vv. 17–20. The double kol resumes the psalm’s universal refrain. The unusual application of ḥasid to God matches v. 17 and Jer 3:12.

Verse 14
“The LORD supports all who are falling and raises all who are bowed down.” After the cosmic claims, the poem turns to close care. The participles (“supporting … raising”) present ongoing acts. The vocabulary recurs immediately in Ps 146:8 (“The LORD raises up [zōqef] those who are bowed down”), creating a canonical echo. This is royal theology transposed: sovereignty as upholding the vulnerable.

Verse 15
“The eyes of all look to you expectantly, and you give them their food in its season.” The idiom of “eyes” looking in hope also appears in Ps 104:27, where all creatures wait for their food. The verb yeshabbeirū (Aramaizing “hope/wait expectantly”) is rare and, paired with “in season,” emphasizes patient sufficiency rather than panic. Provision is as much about timing as about quantity.

Verse 16
“You open your hand and satisfy every living thing with favor/desire.” The anthropomorphism belongs to a biblical idiom for generosity. Deut 15:8 commands humans to “open your hand” to the needy; Ps 104:28 says of God, “You open your hand; they are satisfied with good.” Psalm 145 uniquely applies the human ethical idiom as a definition of divine kingship: cosmic hospitality. The noun rāṣōn bears a double sense: God satisfies with his favor (LXX: eudokia), and he meets each creature’s fitting desire. The ambiguity is the point: divine goodwill manifests by suiting the appetite of each life.

Verse 17
“Righteous is the LORD in all his ways and ḥasid in all his works.” The pairing takes two moral adjectives typically applied to humans and predicates them of God. Ṣaddiq grounds God’s reliability; ḥasid (rare for God; cf. Jer 3:12) underscores loyal, gracious consistency. The double kol keeps the universality in view.

Verse 18
“The LORD is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth.” Nearness answers majesty. The condition “in truth” (beʾemet) signifies sincerity and integrity rather than mere correctness; compare Jer 29:12–13 for the convergence of calling and wholehearted seeking. Availability is real but not mechanical: a relationship is envisioned, not a hotline to power.

Verse 19
“He fulfills the desire of those who fear him; he hears their cry and saves them.” The threefold sequence—fulfill desire / hear cry / save—describes comprehensive providence, both proactive (fitting desires) and reactive (rescue in distress). “Fear” here is reverent orientation, not terror; the alignment of desire with fear signals wise ordering of loves.

Verse 20
“The LORD guards all who love him, but all the wicked he will destroy.” The psalm’s universal care is not moral neutrality. Love and wickedness are opposed stances toward the good order the psalm celebrates. Judgment serves mercy by removing what devours the common good (cf. Mal 3:19 [4:1]). The double kol maintains symmetry: comprehensive keeping and comprehensive unmasking.

Verse 21
“My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD, and all flesh shall bless his holy name forever and ever.” The ending returns to the individual voice now surrounded by a universal choir. “All flesh” usually includes humans and animals (Gen 6–9; Ps 136:25), linking back to vv. 15–16. The inclusio with “forever and ever” (vv. 1–2, 21) frames the psalm’s vision: a lifelong, daily praise that becomes, by God’s reign of open-handed providence, a chorus of all living things.

Figurative language notes (selected):
- “Pour forth” (yabbīʿū, v. 7): metaphor of speech as spring-water; cf. Ps 19:3; 78:2; 94:4. Typical contexts contrast wisdom’s measured utterance with wicked abundance; here abundance signals goodness.
- “Open your hand” (v. 16): ethical idiom for generosity (Deut 15:8, 11) transposed to divine providence; closely paralleled in Ps 104:28.
- “Eyes of all look” (v. 15): creaturely dependence (Ps 104:27) rendered via bodily metaphor, stressing expectation and timing.

Reception note: The acrostic structure and v. 16’s line explain the psalm’s centrality in Jewish prayer (Ashrei). The tradition’s promise (Berakhot 4b) is exegetical: an A-to-Z hymn of a God whose hand is open, near to truth, and just in all ways is an education in praise that prepares one for the world to come.
