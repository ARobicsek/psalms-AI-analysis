**Verse 1**
“Tehillah le-David”—a praise, of David—names the genre and the aim. This is the only psalm to call itself a tehillah. The first bicolon balances intimacy and sovereignty: “I will exalt you, my God, the King.” The verb ארוממך (’aromimkha) is the Piel “I will exalt/raise you,” a frequent praise verb for heightening God’s name in speech (cf. Ps 30:2; 118:28). Two key terms for devotion appear: “exalt” (romem) and “bless” (barak). Blessing God means acknowledging and confessing God’s blessedness, often in public worship. “Forever and ever” (le-‘olam va-‘ed) already sets an inclusio with v. 21. The juxtaposition “my God” and “the King” frames the poem’s paradox: personal address to the one whose rule is universal.

Poetically, this aleph-line launches a sequence of first-person imperfects (“I will bless,” v. 2; “I will meditate,” v. 5; “I will recount,” v. 6). The imperfect here expresses commitment and habit, not mere futurity. The psalm begins with a vow of practice: praise is not occasional but the speaker’s way.

**Verse 2**
“Every day I will bless you” grounds eternity in the ordinary. The daily rhythm (be-kol-yom) converses with “forever and ever.” The verbs shift from line 1’s exalt to line 2’s praise (ahallelah), a verb family that in Piel typically means “to praise,” and in Hallel psalms summons the congregation (“hallelujah”). Here the individual’s daily “blessing” and “praising” anticipate the communal program in vv. 4–7. The line moves from direct address (“I will bless you”) to “your name.” In biblical usage, God’s “name” is not a mere label but the public reality of God’s character, especially as made known in saving actions. To bless the name is to bless the revealed God.

**Verse 3**
“Great is the LORD and greatly to be praised; and of his greatness there is no searching.” The Hebrew plays with the root g-d-l: “great/gadol” and “his greatness/gedullah.” The passive participle “mehullal” (worthy of praise, acclaimed) underscores that praise is owed. “There is no cheqer” (searching out) is rare and Joban (Job 5:9; 9:10; 36:26). The line states a paradox at the heart of biblical worship: praise aims at comprehensiveness (the acrostic), yet God’s greatness is unsearchable. The formulation is not defeatist; it locates praise in wonder rather than inventory.

**Verse 4**
“Generation to generation shall laud your works; they shall declare your mighty acts.” The plural “generations” (dor la-dor) is a stock phrase for continuity (cf. Isa 34:17; Joel 4:20). The verb yeshabbach (“shall laud”) belongs to the Aramaizing root שׁבח “to praise,” characteristic of post-exilic diction (cf. Ps 117:1; 147:12). The second colon’s “declare” (yaggidu, from נגד) often has the sense of public recounting or bearing witness. The parallel is not simple synonymy: the first colon names a general laud; the second specifies testimony to גבורות, God’s “mighty acts,” a technical term for decisive interventions (Exodus, conquest). Praise is transmissive; it becomes pedagogy.

**Verse 5**
“On the majestic glory of your splendor, and on the matters of your wonders, I will muse/recite.” The concentration of radiance terms—hadar (majesty), kavod (glory/weight), hod (splendor)—is deliberate. These words form the psalm’s aesthetic of kingship (see vv. 11–12). The verb ’asichah (from שׂיח) means “to muse, speak meditatively.” It bridges inner reflection and spoken recollection (cf. Ps 119). “Divrei nifl’oteikha” (“the matters/words of your wonders”) blurs act and word: God’s wonders are deeds that speak, requiring thoughtful retelling.

**Verse 6**
“They shall say the might of your awesome deeds; and your greatness I will recount.” The alternation between “they” and “I” creates antiphonal movement. “Awesome deeds” (nora’otekha) shares a root with “fear” (yir’ah): God’s acts evoke the reverence proper to God. The noun ‘ezuz (might) derives from עזז (strength), not a foreign loan; it intensifies might that inspires awe. The first colon’s “they shall say” suggests general proclamation; the second’s “I will recount” (’asaprennah) suggests detailed narration—cataloging greatness in story.

**Verse 7**
“They shall gush forth the memory of your abundant goodness, and your righteousness they shall sing.” The verb yabbi‘u (from נבע) is vivid: like a spring that bubbles up. Praise becomes overflow. “Memory/mention” (zeker) is the public commemoration of God’s acts; “abundant goodness” (rav-tuvkha) echoes Exod 33:19. “Righteousness” (tzedaqah) here is not sternness opposed to goodness but God’s right-making fidelity—an attribute often paired with mercy (cf. Ps 36:7; 103:17). The move from “gush forth” to “sing joyously” (yerannenu) traces a natural arc: commemoration becomes song.

**Verse 8**
“Gracious and compassionate is the LORD, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.” This is the core confession of Exod 34:6–7 in abridged form (omitting “truth/faithfulness,” ‘emet, and the long clauses on forgiveness and punishment). The pairing “gracious/compassionate” recurs often; “compassionate” (rachum) is cognate with “womb” (rechem), an image of visceral care. “Slow to anger” is a bodily metaphor (“long of nostrils”): patience before wrath flares. “Abounding in chesed” names covenant loyalty that does not quit. The psalm’s kingship will be defined by this character, not the other way around.

**Verse 9**
“Good is the LORD to all, and his compassions are over all his works.” The double “all” (kol) is programmatic: the psalm will keep widening its circle. “Compassions” (rachamim, plural of intensity) denote repeated, lived mercy. Traditional Jewish readers already sensed the scope here is genuinely cosmic, extending beyond Israel (cf. Ps 104). The universality will be matched by the universal summons of v. 21.

**Verse 10**
“All your works shall thank you, LORD, and your faithful ones shall bless you.” Two communities appear: all creatures (your “works”) and your chasidim, those who practice loyalty. The verbs differentiate: “thank/acknowledge” (yodukha) is a universal response; “bless” (yevarkhukha) is the covenant community’s role in articulating praise. In Hebrew idiom, blessing God is not bestowing something but declaring God blessed—naming God aright.

**Verse 11**
“They shall speak of the glory of your kingship and talk of your might.” The psalm’s royal diction gathers: “glory” (kavod) and “kingship” (malkhut). The verbs pair ordinary speech (yomeru) with more formal declaration (yedabberu). Royal splendor is not a private intuition but a theme of public speech.

**Verse 12**
“To make known to the sons of Adam his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingship.” Here praise becomes mission: “to make known” (lehodi‘a, hiphil of ידע) is to turn worship into witness. The audience—“sons of Adam”—is deliberately universal. The cluster “glory/majesty/splendor” (kavod/hadar/malkhut) reprises v. 5’s radiance terms around kingship: God’s rule has a beauty to be named among the nations.

**Verse 13**
“Your kingship is a kingship for all ages, and your dominion in every generation.” Paired terms—malkhut (institution) and memshalah (exercise)—name the breadth of sovereignty. The time markers (“all ages,” “every generation”) avoid abstraction: the rule lasts across concrete human time. At this point many Hebrew manuscripts and the Greek and Syriac translations add a nun-line: “Faithful is the LORD in all his words, and gracious in all his works.” The line appears in a Qumran Psalms scroll and in medieval prayerbooks. It fits the acrostic and the psalm’s themes (word/deed; faithfulness/grace), and many modern editions include it in brackets. Whether original or an early restoration, it expresses the reliability that grounds vv. 14–20.

**Verse 14**
“The LORD supports all who are falling and straightens all who are bent.” The royal center moves to the pastoral edge. The participles (“supporting,” “straightening”) present ongoing action. “Falling” and “bent” are bodily figures for vulnerability—physical, social, or spiritual. The repeated “all” insists no sufferer is outside scope. This is kingship as care: sovereignty measured by the plight of the low.

**Verse 15**
“The eyes of all look expectantly to you, and you give them their food in its time.” The verb yesabberu belongs to an Aramaizing root meaning “hope, wait.” The figure is striking: all creatures become a congregation of eyes, watching the true patron. “In its time” is as important as the gift: providence is wise in timing as well as quantity (cf. Qohelet: “a time for every matter”).

**Verse 16**
“You open your hand and satisfy every living thing with favor/its desire.” The picture is anthropomorphic and intimate: an open hand. The participle “masbi‘a” (“satisfying, filling”) belongs to the lexicon of abundance (contrast hunger). The noun ratzon can mean “favor” (God’s good pleasure) or “desire” (of the creature). Either way, the sense is that provision meets creaturely need in a manner consonant with divine goodness. Liturgically, this line has become a touchstone: in Jewish prayer, it is recited with special attentiveness as a confession of daily dependence.

**Verse 17**
“Righteous is the LORD in all his ways and chasid (gracious/faithful) in all his works.” Few texts call God chasid (cf. Jer 3:12). Here “righteous” (tzaddiq) and “chasid” form a pair that resists a false dichotomy: justice and covenantal kindness are not opposites; they are two names for God’s moral reliability. The double “in all his ways/works” reiterates scope.

**Verse 18**
“Near is the LORD to all who call him, to all who call him in truth.” “Near” (qarov) is the psalm’s answer to the problem of royal distance. Access is democratized: “to all.” The qualifier “in truth” (be’emet) is crucial. Classical commentators took it to mean sincerity—mouth and heart aligned—not liturgical correctness or testing God. The poem has traveled from greatness unsearchable (v. 3) to nearness to the true caller. Transcendence and immanence are held together.

**Verse 19**
“The desire of those who fear him he does; their cry he hears, and he saves them.” Three verbs sequence the response: he acts (does), he listens, he delivers. The recipients are “those who fear him,” the reverent. The middle term “their cry” (shav‘atam) is a word for urgent appeal, the cry of distress. The verse answers v. 18’s “call in truth” with the lived posture of reverence.

**Verse 20**
“The LORD guards all who love him, but all the wicked he will destroy.” The poem’s ethic crystallizes: nearness (v. 18), reverence (v. 19), and love (v. 20) mark the relation the psalm imagines. “Guard” (shomer) is a covenant verb. The stark antithesis with “the wicked” is not an afterthought. Divine goodness to “all” (v. 9) does not blur moral lines; it sustains a world in which evil is finally opposed. Medieval readers often resolved verse 9 and verse 20 temporally (mercy now, judgment then); the psalm also resolves them theologically: the same faithfulness that feeds and answers also keeps watch over love and resists what undoes goodness.

**Verse 21**
“The praise of the LORD my mouth shall speak, and all flesh shall bless his holy name forever and ever.” The psalm returns to “my mouth”—the singular with which it began—then passes the word to “all flesh,” a biblical phrase for all living, especially humankind. “His holy name” gathers the poem’s theology into worship: holiness as God’s otherness and reliability, the name as God’s public character. The final “forever and ever” answers v. 1. The movement from “I” to “all flesh” is complete: praise learned in the first person expands into a human vocation. The acrostic has done its work: nothing has been said exhaustively, but praise has been said from aleph to tav—comprehensively enough to teach us how to join the chorus.
