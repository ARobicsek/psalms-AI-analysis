USE CASE 1: Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT) optimization for heart failure
Clinical Scenario
A 68-year-old patient with HFrEF (EF 32%) presents for follow-up. They're currently on a beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor but not on an SGLT2 inhibitor or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA). The physician is managing a busy clinic with 20+ patients scheduled and limited time to review complex heart failure guidelines.
Current State Challenges
At a practice level:
Only 5.3% of HFrEF patients achieve complete GDMT within 12 months of diagnosis, leaving 94.7% on suboptimal therapy[1]
Difficult to track which patients need medication intensification across large patient panels
Real-world data shows patients without full GDMT cost $28,232 per person per month vs $14,128 with complete GDMT[2]
At the individual patient level:
Complex 4-pillar therapy requires remembering interactions, contraindications, and dosing for multiple drug classes
Prior authorizations for newer agents (SGLT2i, ARNI) create workflow delays of 45-60 minutes per patient
Patients face unexpected out-of-pocket costs causing non-adherence
Dose titration schedules are complex and easily forgotten in follow-up visits

A 72-year-old patient with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation presents for cardiology consultation. They have hypertension and diabetes but are not currently on anticoagulation. The physician needs to quickly calculate stroke risk, assess bleeding risk, and initiate appropriate therapy while managing a full clinic schedule.
Current State Challenges
At a practice level:
30-40% of AFib patients with clear anticoagulation indications remain untreated due to workflow barriers and risk calculation complexity
Manual CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED score calculations are time-consuming and prone to error
Difficult to track anticoagulation adherence across large AFib patient panels
At the individual patient level:
Physicians must manually gather data points (age, comorbidities, prior stroke) to calculate risk scores

USE CASE 3: Cardiac Imaging Appropriateness and Utilization Management
Clinical Scenario
A 55-year-old patient with atypical chest pain presents to cardiology clinic. The physician considers ordering a stress test but is uncertain whether nuclear imaging, stress echo, or exercise treadmill test is most appropriate. Insurance pre-authorization requirements and appropriate use criteria add complexity to the decision.
Current State Challenges
At a practice level:
25-30% of cardiac imaging studies are ordered despite not meeting appropriate use criteria, leading to denials and rework
Complex AUC (Appropriate Use Criteria) guidelines are difficult to apply in real-time clinical workflows
Pre-authorization requirements vary by payer and imaging modality, creating administrative burden
At the individual patient level:
Physicians must manually review patient history, risk factors, and prior testing to determine appropriateness
Insurance denials delay diagnosis and require ordering alternative tests, frustrating patients

USE CASE 4: Familial Hypercholesterolemia Detection and Cascade Screening
Clinical Scenario
A 42-year-old patient presents for annual physical with LDL cholesterol of 220 mg/dL despite statin therapy. They have a family history of early heart disease but have never been screened for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). The physician suspects FH but is unfamiliar with diagnostic criteria and cascade screening protocols.
Current State Challenges
At a practice level:
Less than 10% of individuals with FH in the US are diagnosed, leaving 850,000+ undiagnosed and untreated[10]
Cascade screening of family members is rarely performed even after FH diagnosis
Complex genetic testing pathways and criteria deter systematic screening
At the individual patient level:

Clinical Scenario
A 58-year-old patient presents for first cardiology follow-up 2 weeks after STEMI treated with primary PCI. They were discharged on aspirin, ticagrelor, atorvastatin, and metoprolol but are not on an ACE inhibitor. The cardiologist needs to ensure complete secondary prevention therapy while addressing medication tolerance and adherence barriers.
Current State Challenges
At a practice level:
Only 65% of post-MI patients receive all 4 evidence-based medication classes (antiplatelet, statin, beta-blocker, ACE-I/ARB) at 1 year[14]
Medication gaps often go unrecognized during busy post-MI follow-up visits
Complex DAPT duration decisions (6 vs 12 months) require weighing bleeding vs ischemic risk
At the individual patient level:
Patients face polypharmacy burden with 5-8 new medications after MI
Side effects (bleeding, bradycardia, cough from ACE-I) lead to medication discontinuation

USE CASE 6: Ambulatory Procedural Site Optimization (Cath Lab vs ASC)
Clinical Scenario
A 65-year-old patient needs an elective diagnostic cardiac catheterization for stable angina. The health system has both a hospital-based cath lab and an ambulatory surgery center (ASC) with similar capabilities. The physician must decide which facility offers the best combination of safety, cost-effectiveness, and patient convenience.
Current State Challenges
At a practice level:
Procedural volume fragmentation across multiple facilities reduces efficiency and increases costs
Lack of real-time visibility into ASC vs hospital margin differences for specific procedures
Manual assessment of patient appropriateness for ASC leads to suboptimal utilization
At the individual patient level:
Physicians default to hospital-based procedures due to familiarity, missing ASC cost savings opportunities
Complex criteria for ASC safety (BMI, comorbidities, anesthesia risk) require time-consuming assessment
Patients unaware of ASC advantages: lower copays, convenient parking, faster discharge

Quality & Safety
ASC complication rates equivalent to hospital for appropriate patients (0.5% vs 0.6% for diagnostic cath)

USE CASE 8: Chest Pain Triage with Coronary CTA vs Nuclear Stress
Clinical Scenario
A 48-year-old patient with atypical chest pain and intermediate pretest probability of CAD presents to cardiology clinic. The physician considers stress testing but is uncertain whether coronary CTA, nuclear stress test, or stress echo offers the best diagnostic pathway balancing accuracy, cost, and radiation exposure.
Current State Challenges
At a practice level:
Nuclear stress testing remains default strategy despite coronary CTA advantages for low-intermediate risk patients
Radiation exposure from nuclear imaging (10-15 mSv) often exceeds CTA (2-5 mSv with modern protocols)
CTA capacity bottlenecks lead to delays, defaulting to nuclear stress despite being suboptimal
At the individual patient level:
Physicians unfamiliar with patient selection criteria for CTA (age, heart rate, BMI, renal function)
Insurance variability in CTA coverage creates uncertainty about authorization
Patients face different costs: nuclear stress $2,500-$4,000 vs CTA $1,000-$2,000

Impact on Three Pillars
Economics (Value-Based Care & Fee-for-Service)
CTA costs 40-60% less than nuclear stress testing ($1,200 vs $3,000 per test)[21]
Higher diagnostic accuracy reduces unnecessary downstream catheterizations by 30%
Preferred by payers due to cost-effectiveness, reducing authorization challenges
Estimated financial impact: $80K-$150K annually per cardiologist through optimized test selection and reduced unnecessary procedures
Quality & Safety
