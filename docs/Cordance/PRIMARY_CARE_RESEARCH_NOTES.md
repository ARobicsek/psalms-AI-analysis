## HCC CODING OPTIMIZATION

### Risk Adjustment Factor (RAF) Scores

### Documentation Requirements
- **MEAT criteria**: Monitored, Evaluated, Assessed, or Treated with supporting clinical evidence
- Annual encounter required by APRN, PA, or physician
- Chronic conditions must be **recaptured each year** or they drop off
- Code to **highest level of specificity** (ICD-10)

**Financial Impact:**

## PRE-OPERATIVE CLEARANCE OPTIMIZATION

### Conceptual Shift
- NOT "cardiac clearance" - rather **"risk stratification and mitigation"**
- Emergent (<6 hours) or urgent (6-24 hours) surgery cannot undergo full preop workup

**Citations:**
- Cardiac risk assessment (NCBI NBK537146): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537146/
- Perioperative cardiac management (NCBI NBK493196): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493196/

### Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI)
- **Lee Risk Index (1999)**: Predicts MI, pulmonary edema, VF/cardiac arrest, complete AV block
- **6 risk factors**: Surgical type, ischemic heart disease Hx, heart failure Hx, cerebrovascular disease Hx, preop insulin therapy, creatinine >2 mg/dL

**Complication rates by RCRI score:**
- 0 markers: **0.4%** major cardiac complications
- 1 marker: **0.9%**
- 2 markers: **6.6%**
- ≥3 markers: **11%**

**Citations:**
- RCRI MDCalc: https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/1739/revised-cardiac-risk-index-pre-operative-risk
- 2025 preop update: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12352404/

### Algorithm Components
- Assessment of surgical urgency
- Clinical assessment for acute coronary syndrome
- Combined medical/surgical risk using: RCRI, Gupta MICA calculator, or ACS NSQIP calculator
- **Low-risk asymptomatic**: NO additional testing, proceed to surgery

### Testing Limitations
- Even for elective procedures, noninvasive stress testing role dubious
- Preoperative revascularization hasn't shown reduction in perioperative cardiac complications
