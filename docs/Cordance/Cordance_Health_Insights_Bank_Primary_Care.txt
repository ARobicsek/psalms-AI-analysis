USE CASE 1: Comprehensive Preventive Care Optimization and Gap Closure
Clinical Scenario
A 52-year-old patient presents for annual physical. They are due for multiple preventive services (colorectal cancer screening, mammogram, lipid screening, immunizations) but physician is uncertain which are covered, when last done, and how to coordinate scheduling across multiple facilities while addressing cost barriers.
Current State Challenges
At a practice level:
Only 59% of eligible patients are up-to-date with colorectal cancer screening, leaving significant preventive care gaps[1]
Physicians must manually review previous visit notes and outside records to determine what preventive services are due[2]
Preventive care guidelines change frequently (USPSTF, CDC), making it difficult to stay current
Insurance coverage for preventive services varies and isn't transparent at point of care
At the individual patient level:
Patients often overdue for multiple preventive services simultaneously
Scheduling across multiple facilities (mammography, endoscopy, lab) is time-consuming
Cost barriers prevent patients from completing recommended screening
Lack of coordination leads to patients 'falling through the cracks' for follow-up

USE CASE 4: Polypharmacy Optimization and Deprescribing in Older Adults
Clinical Scenario
A 78-year-old patient presents for follow-up on 14 medications. They've had two falls in the past 6 months, complain of dizziness and dry mouth, and report difficulty affording medications. Their medication list includes three anticholinergic drugs (diphenhydramine for sleep, oxybutynin for overactive bladder, amitriptyline for neuropathy), a benzodiazepine (lorazepam), and duplicate antihypertensives causing hypotension.
Current State Challenges
At a practice level:
Polypharmacy (≥5 medications) affects >40% of older adults and is a leading cause of adverse drug reactions[21]
Beers Criteria lists potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) in older adults, but manual review is time-consuming[22]
Anticholinergic burden and fall risk difficult to calculate without automated tools
Deprescribing requires complex risk-benefit analysis that's challenging in busy primary care
At the individual patient level:
Anticholinergic drugs increase fall risk: each Level 2 drug increases fall/injury hazard by 56% (HR 1.56)[23]
Hip fracture costs $30,000-$60,000 per event with significant mortality and morbidity[24]
Medication costs create financial strain, leading to non-adherence to essential medications
Polypharmacy causes cognitive impairment, functional decline, and reduced quality of life

USE CASE 6: Colonoscopy Referral Retention and Screening Completion
Clinical Scenario
A 52-year-old patient is due for colorectal cancer screening. The physician recommends colonoscopy and begins searching for available gastroenterologists, but is unsure whether in-network GI has availability, how long the wait is, or if patient can afford the procedure. The patient leaves with a vague plan to "schedule somewhere" but the referral goes unfulfilled.
Current State Challenges
At a practice level:
Only 59% of eligible patients (age 45-75) are up-to-date with colorectal cancer screening, leaving millions at risk[34]
Screening colonoscopy referrals frequently leak to out-of-network facilities due to access barriers and patient convenience
Long wait times for in-network GI (often 3-6 months) lead patients to seek faster external options
Lost referral revenue and downstream pathology/treatment opportunities
At the individual patient level:
Patients given referral but left to navigate scheduling, creating friction and abandonment
Confusion about different screening options (colonoscopy vs FIT vs Cologuard)
Positive FIT tests require colonoscopy within 6 months; without outreach, many patients never complete diagnostic evaluation[35]
Cost uncertainty creates hesitation (screening colonoscopy fully covered, but what if polyps found?)

USE CASE 7: Lower Back Pain Imaging Stewardship and Physical Therapy First
Clinical Scenario
A 38-year-old patient presents with acute lower back pain for 10 days after helping a friend move. They request an MRI to "see what's wrong." There are no red flags (no fever, no neurological deficits, no trauma, no history of cancer). The physician knows imaging is not indicated but faces patient expectations, uncertainty about what to offer instead, and concern about missing something serious.
Current State Challenges

USE CASE 8: HCC Coding Optimization and Risk Adjustment Accuracy
Clinical Scenario
A 72-year-old Medicare Advantage patient presents for annual wellness visit with chronic conditions including diabetes with neuropathy, COPD, and heart failure. The physician manages these conditions but codes only "diabetes" without specifying complications. The patient's RAF (Risk Adjustment Factor) score remains artificially low, underestimating their complexity and underpayment for their care.
Current State Challenges
At a practice level:
$377 million lost annually from HCC coding inaccuracies and missed risk adjustment opportunities[48]
RADV audits extrapolate findings across entire population: every $1 of overpayment becomes $55 in penalties[49]
Chronic conditions must be recaptured annually or they drop off RAF calculations, requiring systematic documentation
Physicians unfamiliar with HCC coding specificity requirements and MEAT criteria (Monitored, Evaluated, Assessed, Treated)
At the individual patient level:
RAF score 1.0 = average predicted costs; higher RAF = more complex/costly patients deserving higher capitation payments[50]
Undercoding underestimates patient complexity, leading to inadequate resources for care management
Vague documentation ("diabetes") vs specific coding ("diabetes with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, E11.40") misses HCC capture
Annual physician or APP visit required to recapture chronic HCCs; specialist visits don't count
Cordance Solution
Before Encounter
Identifies all Medicare Advantage patients with HCC gaps or recapture needs
Creates prioritized list based on: suspected HCCs (conditions discussed but not coded); prior year HCCs needing annual recapture; chronic conditions without specific ICD-10 codes
Pre-loads problem list, previous year's HCC diagnoses, and specialty visit notes mentioning chronic conditions
During Encounter
Displays HCC dashboard: current RAF score vs expected based on complexity; HCCs captured year-to-date vs prior year; 'Recapture List' of chronic conditions from last year needing documentation this year; 'Coding Specificity Opportunities' where more specific ICD-10 codes apply[51]
Real-time coding suggestions during documentation: 'Diabetes and neuropathy discussed. Consider E11.40 (Type 2 DM with diabetic neuropathy) instead of E11.9 (Type 2 DM without complications)'; 'CHF mentioned. Specify systolic vs diastolic and acute vs chronic for accurate HCC'
MEAT criteria helper: one-click inserts documentation phrases supporting HCC codes: 'Diabetes with neuropathy: Monitored with HbA1c and monofilament exam. Evaluated current glycemic control. Assessed medication adherence. Treated with metformin and gabapentin for neuropathic pain'
One-click adds diagnoses to Assessment & Plan with appropriate specificity
Alerts for conditions needing annual encounter (specialist notes don't count for RAF)
After Encounter
Validates that all discussed chronic conditions have been coded with appropriate specificity
Generates HCC recapture report for quality assurance and revenue cycle review
Schedules follow-up for patients with multiple HCC gaps requiring additional visits
Tracks RAF score changes and estimated revenue impact
Creates alerts for conditions needing recapture before year-end
Impact on Three Pillars
Economics (Value-Based Care & Fee-for-Service)
Accurate HCC coding increases capitation payments reflecting true patient complexity (average $10K-$15K additional revenue per PCP panel annually)[52]
Avoids RADV penalties where every dollar of inaccuracy multiplies 55x across population[53]
Higher RAF scores enable enhanced care management resources for complex patients
Supports accurate cost predictions for Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) ACOs
Estimated financial impact: $100K-$200K annually per PCP through accurate risk adjustment and avoided penalties
Quality & Safety
Accurate documentation of patient complexity enables appropriate care management resources
Systematic review of chronic conditions ensures nothing is overlooked or under-managed
Improved problem list accuracy enhances care coordination and medication reconciliation

Revenue cycle management partnership for HCC validation and reporting
Physician education on HCC coding principles and MEAT criteria
USE CASE 9: Pre-operative Risk Stratification and Clearance Optimization
Clinical Scenario
A 68-year-old patient with hypertension and diabetes is scheduled for elective hip replacement in 3 weeks. The surgeon requests "cardiac clearance." The physician is uncertain which tests are needed (EKG? stress test? echo?), how to calculate cardiac risk, and whether the patient can safely proceed with surgery. The patient is anxious and the surgical scheduler is pressing for clearance documentation.
Current State Challenges
At a practice level:
Pre-operative clearance requests are frequent but guidelines are complex and vary by surgery type
Conceptual shift: NOT 'cardiac clearance' but rather 'risk stratification and mitigation' to optimize perioperative outcomes[54]
Unnecessary testing (stress tests, echos) delays surgery without improving outcomes
Missing required tests leads to OR cancellations costing $1,500-$10,000 per case plus patient/surgeon frustration
At the individual patient level:
Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) predicts perioperative cardiac complications: 0 factors = 0.4% risk; 1 factor = 0.9%; 2 factors = 6.6%; ≥3 factors = 11% risk[55]
Patients on anticoagulation need bridge therapy guidance (when to stop, when to restart)
Anesthesia groups have specific requirements that vary by hospital/surgery center
Communication gaps between PCP, surgeon, and anesthesia lead to missing information and delays
Cordance Solution
Before Encounter
Identifies all patients with upcoming surgeries requiring pre-operative assessment
Pre-loads surgery type, patient comorbidities, current medications, and recent labs/tests
Retrieves specific anesthesia requirements for the surgical center (e.g., K+ within 7 days, EKG within 30 days for patients >65)
During Encounter
Automatic RCRI calculation based on 6 factors: high-risk surgery (intrathoracic, intraperitoneal, suprainguinal vascular); ischemic heart disease history; heart failure history; cerebrovascular disease history; preop insulin therapy; creatinine >2 mg/dL[56]
Risk-based testing recommendations: Low risk (RCRI 0-1) → NO additional testing, proceed to surgery; Intermediate risk (RCRI 2) → consider functional capacity assessment; High risk (RCRI ≥3) → consider cardiology consultation, optimize medical therapy
Pre-operative checklist customized to surgery and anesthesia requirements: required labs (CBC, BMP, coags if needed); required imaging (CXR for thoracic surgery); medication management (hold metformin morning of surgery, continue beta-blockers); anticoagulation bridge plan if applicable
Flags missing requirements with one-click ordering: 'Missing: Potassium level within 7 days' → one-click BMP order; 'Missing: EKG within 30 days for age >65' → one-click EKG order
Anticoagulation bridge protocol: for patients on warfarin/DOACs, generates specific instructions (stop warfarin 5 days before, bridge with enoxaparin if high VTE risk, check INR day before surgery)
One-click inserts 'Cleared for Surgery' template addressing surgeon/anesthesia requirements
After Encounter
Orders all missing labs/tests identified in pre-op checklist
Sends clearance letter to surgeon and anesthesia with RCRI score, optimization plan, and test results
Patient education: medication instructions (what to take, what to hold), fasting instructions, when to arrive
Creates alert: if new labs show abnormality (e.g., hypokalemia), notify PCP before surgery
Tracks OR cancellation rates due to inadequate pre-op workup
Impact on Three Pillars
Economics (Value-Based Care & Fee-for-Service)
Prevents costly OR cancellations ($1,500-$10,000 per case) due to incomplete workup or abnormal labs discovered day-of-surgery
Reduces unnecessary testing (stress tests for low-risk patients) saving $1,500-$3,000 per avoided test
Optimized perioperative medical management reduces post-operative complications by 20-30%
Improved surgical throughput by preventing delays and rescheduling
Estimated financial impact: $80K-$150K annually per PCP through reduced cancellations and avoided unnecessary testing
Quality & Safety
RCRI-based risk stratification prevents both under-testing (missing high-risk patients) and over-testing (unnecessary stress tests in low-risk patients)[57]
Even for elective procedures, noninvasive stress testing has dubious role; preoperative revascularization hasn't shown reduction in perioperative cardiac complications[58]
Anticoagulation bridge protocols prevent perioperative bleeding and thrombotic complications
Systematic checklist ensures all anesthesia requirements met, reducing day-of-surgery surprises
Population Health & Outcomes
Standardized risk assessment across all pre-operative patients
Enables tracking of perioperative outcomes and continuous quality improvement
Reduces delays to necessary surgery, improving access and patient satisfaction
Data-driven conversations with surgeons/anesthesia about testing requirements
Estimated impact: 50-70% reduction in OR cancellations due to incomplete pre-op workup
Physician Value Proposition
Eliminates uncertainty about which tests are needed with surgery-specific checklists
Automated RCRI calculation removes mental math and guideline memorization
One-click clearance templates save 10-15 minutes per pre-op visit
Reduces phone calls and rework from missing information
Protects against medico-legal risk by documenting systematic risk assessment
Implementation Considerations
Integration with surgical scheduling systems to identify upcoming surgeries
Anesthesia group-specific requirement databases (varies by hospital/surgery center)
EHR integration for automated RCRI calculation and order entry
Anticoagulation bridge protocols and patient education materials
USE CASE 10: Generic/Biosimilar Therapeutic Interchange and Cost Savings
Clinical Scenario
A 55-year-old patient with rheumatoid arthritis is on adalimumab (Humira) costing $6,000 per month with $400 patient copay. An interchangeable biosimilar (Cyltezo) is now available at 60% lower cost with $50 copay, but the physician is uncertain about biosimilar safety, efficacy, and the switching process. The patient is hesitant due to concerns about "switching to a different medication."
Current State Challenges
At a practice level:
Biosimilars have generated $56 billion in healthcare savings since 2015, with $20 billion saved in 2024 alone[59]
Despite proven safety and efficacy, biosimilar adoption remains low due to physician/patient unfamiliarity and switching inertia
Therapeutic interchange opportunities extend beyond biologics to branded vs generic drugs (inhalers, PPIs, antidepressants)
Manual formulary navigation is time-consuming and patient copays often unknown at point of prescribing
At the individual patient level:
Biosimilars are 50-60% cheaper than reference biologics at launch with NO clinically meaningful differences in efficacy/safety[60]
Interchangeability designation means biosimilars can be substituted without consulting prescriber (like generic drugs)[61]
Lower copayments improve adherence: VHA and Kaiser Permanente saw 80% adherence improvement with interchange programs vs 3.2% average[62]
Patients confused about biosimilar vs generic vs "different medication"
Cordance Solution
Before Encounter
Identifies all patients on high-cost branded medications with available generic or biosimilar alternatives
Creates prioritized list based on: highest patient copay savings; greatest system cost savings; interchangeable biosimilars vs therapeutically equivalent alternatives
Checks patient-specific formulary for coverage and tier placement
During Encounter
Real-time formulary optimization alerts: 'Switch Symbicort (fluticasone/formoterol) to Wixela? Saves patient $150/month'; 'Switch Humira (adalimumab) to Cyltezo (interchangeable biosimilar)? Saves patient $350/month and health system $2,400/month'
Displays comparison: current medication (brand name, copay, tier); alternative (generic/biosimilar name, copay, tier); evidence of therapeutic equivalence or interchangeability; patient cost savings (monthly and annually); system cost savings
Biosimilar education: 'Biosimilars are highly similar to original biologic with NO clinically significant differences in efficacy/safety. Approved through comprehensive analytical, preclinical, and clinical trials'[63]
Shows local pharmacy availability: which pharmacies stock the alternative medication
One-click switch: discontinues old prescription, orders new one with appropriate quantity/refills
Generates patient-friendly explanation: 'We are switching you to a medication that works the same but costs less'
After Encounter
Sends prescription to patient's preferred pharmacy (or specialty pharmacy if biologic)
Pharmacy notification of therapeutic interchange with education for patient counseling
Patient education materials on biosimilars/generics with FAQ addressing safety concerns
Follow-up alert at 30-60 days to confirm tolerance and adherence
Tracks cost savings at patient and population level
Impact on Three Pillars
Economics (Value-Based Care & Fee-for-Service)
Biosimilars average 50-60% cost savings vs reference biologics, translating to $2,000-$4,000 per patient annually[64]
Generic substitutions save $200-$400 per patient annually across common medication classes
Improved medication affordability increases adherence, reducing downstream hospitalizations and complications
Health system captures margin on internal specialty pharmacy dispensing
Estimated financial impact: $100K-$180K annually per PCP through therapeutic interchange across patient panel
Quality & Safety
Biosimilars demonstrate NO clinically significant differences from reference products in rigorous comparative trials[65]
Interchangeable biosimilars meet additional FDA standards for switching studies[66]
Improved medication adherence through reduced cost barriers leads to better disease control
Generic medications are bioequivalent to brand-name counterparts by FDA requirement
Population Health & Outcomes
Systematic identification of high-cost medication users across entire patient panel
Reduces health disparities by addressing medication affordability barriers
80% adherence improvement when cost barriers removed through interchange programs[67]
Population-level tracking of biosimilar adoption and cost savings
Estimated impact: 60-75% conversion rate to biosimilars/generics among eligible patients, $500K-$1M annual savings per 1,000-patient panel
Physician Value Proposition
Real-time formulary information eliminates guesswork about coverage and copays
One-click switching saves time compared to manual prescription changes
Patient education tools address biosimilar safety concerns proactively
