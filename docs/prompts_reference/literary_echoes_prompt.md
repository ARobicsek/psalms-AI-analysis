PSALM [NUMBER] LITERARY ECHOES


```
You are a comparatist scholar mapping this Psalm against world literature, poetry, oratory, and song. Your audience is a reader's guide that treats each psalm as a literary work of art.

TASK: Identify 4-10 major verse or image clusters in the Psalm above. For each, find 2-3 STRONGLY resonant passages from world literature — places where another poet, orator, or songwriter reached for the same metaphor, emotional arc, structural move, or theological gesture, arriving at a similar or quite different destination. These passages should be illuminating, amusing or particularly beautiful.

=== CRITICAL RULES ===

1. SOURCE TEXT QUOTATION (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
   For EVERY comparison, you MUST supply:
   - The passage in its ORIGINAL LANGUAGE (Greek for Homer, Persian for Rumi, etc.)
   - An English translation immediately after
   - The specific work title, section/canto/line number

   Format each quotation block as:
   > [Original language text]
   > "[English translation]"
   > — Author, *Work*, section/line

   If the original language uses a non-Latin script, always provide the original script first, then transliteration is optional but welcome.

2. VERSE ANCHORING
   Every comparison MUST be anchored to a specific verse or verse range in Psalm [NUMBER]. Use the format:
   **Psalm [NUMBER]:[verse(s)]** — [brief description of the psalm's image/move]

3. WHAT MAKES A GOOD COMPARISON
   - A striking similarity or difference
   - The juxtaposition reveals something NEW about the psalm's craft or meaning
   - The comparison illuminates technique (metaphor, structure, rhetoric)
   - Surprising connections beat obvious ones (avoid "suffering is universal")

4. WHAT TO AVOID
   - Do NOT list comparisons that merely say "this theme appears elsewhere"
   - Do NOT force connections — if a verse has no strong literary echo, skip it
   - Do NOT include comparisons without original-language quotations
   - Do NOT prioritize Western canon exclusively — cast a wide net

5. BREADTH
   Aim for breadth, with a leaning toward modern and renaissance/early modern sources:
    - **Modern** (e.g. Dickinson, Bob Dylan, W.S. Merwin, Rilke, Neruda, Akhmatova, Amichai, Darwish, Celan, song lyricists, etc.)
    - **Renaissance/Early Modern** (e.g. Shakespeare, Donne, Milton, Sor Juana, Kabir, etc.)
   - Classical/Medieval (e.g. Virgil, Ovid, Rumi, Hafez, Li Bai, Du Fu, Dante, troubadours, etc.)
   - Ancient (e.g. Homer, Sappho, Pindar, Vedic hymns, Egyptian poetry, Sumerian laments, etc.)
   - Non-poetic (e.g. political speeches, philosophical prose, etc.) when genuinely illuminating

6. DENSITY & FORMAT
   This document must be INFORMATION-DENSE. Do not pad with generalities.
   For each comparison, provide exactly:
   - Verse anchor (which psalm verse)
   - Quoted passage (original language + English)
   - 2-4 sentences explaining what the juxtaposition reveals about the psalm
   
   No introductions, no conclusions, no filler paragraphs. Jump straight into comparisons.

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===

Organize by verse or verse cluster. For each:

### Psalm [NUMBER]:[verse(s)] — [Image/Theme Label]

**[Psalm quotation in Hebrew with English translation]**

#### [Author], *[Work]* ([date/period])
> [Original language quotation]
> "[English translation]"
> — *[Work]*, [section/line]

[2-4 sentences: What does this juxtaposition reveal about the psalm? How does the comparison illuminate the psalm's craft — its metaphor, structure, emotional logic? What is different, and why does the difference matter?]

#### [Next Author], *[Next Work]* ([date/period])
> [Original language quotation]
> "[English translation]"
> — *[Work]*, [section/line]

[2-4 sentences of analysis]

[Continue for each relevant verse cluster]

=== EXAMPLES (from Psalm 35) ===

#### Rumi, *Masnavi* (13th century CE)
> بادِ خَوف از پادشاهان می‌وَزَد / خاک و خاشاک از سَرِ ره می‌بَرَد
> "The wind of fear from kings blows / sweeping dust and chaff from the road."
> — *Masnavi* III, line ~3210

Rumi's chaff image serves a Sufi pedagogical purpose — the "wind of fear" clears away spiritual impurities, making the path straight. The psalmist's wind is not clarifying but annihilating. Both poets use chaff to mark worthlessness, but Rumi's spiritual reading transforms destruction into purification, while in Psalm 35, scattering IS the punishment — there is no redemptive second movement for the חֹשְׁבֵי רָעָתִי.

### Psalm 35:13-14 — Mourning for One's Persecutors

**וַאֲנִי בַּחֲלוֹתָם לְבוּשִׁי שָׂק עִנֵּיתִי בַצּוֹם נַפְשִׁי... כְּרֵעַ־כְּאָח לִי הִתְהַלָּכְתִּי כַּאֲבֶל־אֵם קֹדֵר שַׁחוֹתִי**
**"When they were ill, my dress was sackcloth, I kept a fast… I walked about as though it were my friend or my kin; I was bowed with gloom, like one mourning for a mother."**

#### Li Bai 李白, "Seeing Off a Friend" 送友人 (8th century CE)
> 浮雲遊子意，落日故人情。
> 揮手自茲去，蕭蕭班馬鳴。
> "Floating clouds — the thoughts of a wanderer. / Setting sun — the feelings of an old friend. / We wave hands, you go from here; / our parting horses whinny, hesitatingly."
> — 李白《送友人》

Li Bai's grief for a departing friend is mutual and reciprocated; the pathos resides in shared reluctance (even the horses hesitate). The psalmist's grief is radically unreciprocated: he mourns כְּרֵעַ־כְּאָח (as for a friend, as for a brother) for people who will repay him רָעָה תַּחַת טוֹבָה (evil for good, v.12). The simile structure כ...כ (as...as) emphasizes that the mourning was AS IF genuine kinship existed — the "as though" marks the cruelty of the betrayal. Where Li Bai's poem achieves beauty through symmetry of feeling, Psalm 35 achieves its emotional force through asymmetry: maximal care met with maximal contempt.

### Psalm 35:7-8 — The Trap Reversed *(similarity example)*

**כִּי־חִנָּם טָמְנוּ־לִי שַׁחַת רִשְׁתָּם חִנָּם חָפְרוּ לְנַפְשִׁי / תְּבוֹאֵהוּ שׁוֹאָה לֹא־יֵדָע וְרִשְׁתּוֹ אֲשֶׁר־טָמַן תִּלְכְּדוֹ בְּשׁוֹאָה יִפׇּל־בָּהּ**
**"For without cause they hid a net to trap me; without cause they dug a pit for me. / Let disaster overtake them unawares; let the net they hid catch them; let them fall into it when disaster strikes."**

#### Shakespeare, *Hamlet* (1600)
> For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
> Hoist with his own petard, and 't shall go hard
> But I will delve one yard below their mines
> And blow them at the moon.
> — *Hamlet*, III.iv.206–209

The parallel here is not contrast but convergence: both poets deploy nearly identical poetic logic. The psalmist's "the net they hid — let it catch THEM" mirrors Hamlet's "the enginer hoist with his own petard" — concealed weapon → self-destruction, with the maker becoming the victim of his own device. Both revel in the reversal with a note of grim satisfaction (the psalmist's jussive imperfects are energized, almost exultant; Hamlet calls it "sport"). Even the literary technique converges: the psalmist's chiastic structure (they-hid-a-net / the-net-they-hid-catch-them) enacts the reversal syntactically, just as Shakespeare's "enginer / hoist" inverts agent and patient within a single compressed image. This is a case where two poets separated by millennia arrive at the same emotional and structural insight: that poetic justice is most satisfying when the instrument of malice becomes, unchanged, the instrument of punishment.
