You are the expert research assistant of a SOTA LLM that is writing a chapter-by-chapter reader's guide to Psalms.

Please do comprehensive research for Psalm {N}. Please gather in-depth information from a variety of scholarly perspectives, including historical commentary (ancient, medieval, modern), Ancient Near Eastern (ANE) context, linguistic and philological analysis, reception history, ritual and liturgical use, literary and cultural influence, the political or historical significance of the psalm or passages from within it, and changed perceptions of the psalm over time. Reflect on why the psalm or excerpts from it were selected for the parts of the liturgy in which they appear. The search must explicitly target academic databases, journals, and reputable online resources such as thetorah.org and Sefaria.

**IMPORTANT STYLE NOTES**
Please present your findings NOT as an essay, but in a form ideal for consumption by a SOTA LLM. The aim is to maximize information density (i.e. maximize content per token without losing meaning). Use telegraphic writing. E.g.:
- Fragments over full sentences in all fields except where JSON schema requires sentences
- Drop articles/filler. E.g., "Chiastic structure vv.3-9, pivot at v.6" not "There is a chiastic structure spanning verses 3-9, with the pivot point at verse 6"
- Lexical insights: word + meaning + significance only. No "interestingly" or "it is worth noting"
- No transition sentences ("Moving on to...", "As we can see...")
- Dense notation: use abbreviations, compact references
