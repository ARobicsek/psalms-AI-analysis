# Session 67 - Data Curation and Bug Fixing for `sacks_on_psalms.json` (2025-11-03)

**Goal**: Resolve missing `context_snippet` fields in the `sacks_on_psalms.json` file and perform data cleanup as requested.

**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Session Overview

This session focused on data quality for the `sacks_on_psalms.json` file. The primary goals were to fix the remaining 67 entries with missing context snippets and then remove a specific subset of entries. The session also included providing system administration assistance to the user.

## Issues Investigated and Fixed

### 1. Missing `context_snippet` Generation (RESOLVED)

**Problem**: 81 out of 230 entries in `sacks_on_psalms.json` were missing the `context_snippet`, primarily in Hebrew-only texts. A previous fix was incomplete.

**Investigation & Process**:
1.  **Initial Analysis**: The first reprocessing script failed entirely. Debugging revealed the script was using incorrect keys to access the text data (`en_text`/`he_text` instead of `text`/`he`).
2.  **Second Analysis**: After fixing the keys, the script fixed 14 entries but 67 remained broken. Analysis of the failures showed two distinct problems:
    *   **English Failures**: Simple string matching for citations like `(Psalms 1:4)` was too rigid.
    *   **Hebrew Failures**: The Gematria conversion was generating numerals with Gershayim (e.g., `כ״ב`), but the source text often omitted it (e.g., `כב`).
3.  **Regex-based Solution**: A more robust, regex-based strategy was developed.
    *   **English Regex**: Created a pattern `(?i)(?:Psalms?|Ps\.?|Tehillim)\s*{chapter_num}\s*[:,.]?\s*{verse_num}` to handle case-insensitivity, multiple book names (`Psalms`, `Ps.`, `Tehillim`), and varied punctuation.
    *   **Hebrew Regex**: Modified the Gematria conversion function to output a regex pattern that made the Gershayim optional, e.g., `כ(?:״)?ב`.
4.  **Final Execution**: The final script, `reprocess_sacks_json_v3.py`, successfully processed the data, filling in **54** additional snippets.

**Outcome**: The number of entries missing snippets was reduced from 81 to **13**, bringing the dataset to **~94% completion**.

### 2. Data Cleanup (RESOLVED)

**Problem**: The user requested the removal of all entries from a specific Hebrew translation.

**Solution**:
1.  Created a script (`remove_entries_by_heVersionTitle.py`) to filter the main JSON array.
2.  The script removed all entries where the `heVersionTitle` was exactly "Covenant and Conversation, trans. by Tsur Ehrlich, Maggid Books, 2017".

**Outcome**: Successfully removed **24 entries**, reducing the total count from 230 to 206.

### 3. CLI Tool Path Issue (RESOLVED)

**Problem**: The user had installed a CLI tool (`claude`) but its installation directory was not in the system's PATH environment variable, preventing it from being run directly.

**Solution**:
1.  Attempted to set the PATH using PowerShell's .NET methods, but these were blocked by security policies.
2.  Used the standard Windows `setx` command (`setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\Users\ariro\.local\bin"`) which successfully and persistently updated the user's PATH.
3.  Advised the user to restart their terminal for the change to take effect.
