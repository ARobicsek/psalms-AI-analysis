# Start Next Session - Documentation Consolidation (Phase 3)

**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: Phase 2 Complete âœ… | Phase 3 Ready

---

## What Was Just Completed (Phase 2)

âœ… **Phase 2.1**: Consolidated 8 phonetic documents â†’ 4 streamlined docs
âœ… **Phase 2.2**: Reduced NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md from 1,485 â†’ 180 lines (88% reduction)
âœ… **Phase 2.3**: Archived 7 session summary files to docs/archive/sessions/
âœ… **Committed**: All changes committed with git mv (history preserved)

---

## COPY AND PASTE THIS INTO YOUR NEXT SESSION:

================================================================================

Please execute Phase 3 (New Documentation) from the documentation consolidation plan.

Launch 4 agents to work on these tasks in parallel:
1. Create DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md (scan src/ directory, explain code organization)
2. Create GLOSSARY.md (define project-specific terms alphabetically)
3. Consolidate overview.md into CONTEXT.md and archive it
4. Update cross-references across all docs

Use the agentic approach for maximum efficiency.

All detailed instructions are in @START_NEXT_SESSION.txt and @docs/DOCUMENTATION_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md (lines 275-324).

================================================================================

## Phase 3 Overview: New Documentation (4 tasks, ~1-2 hours)

### Task 1: Create DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md (45 min)
**Agent Prompt**:
```
Create docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md to help developers navigate the codebase.

Content to include:
1. Code organization - Explain src/ directory structure
2. Where to find agents - List macro_analyst.py, micro_analyst.py, synthesis_writer.py, master_editor.py locations
3. Librarian vs AI agents - Explain the distinction (Librarian = Python helper, AI agents = Claude/GPT-5)
4. Data flow between components - How research bundles flow through pipeline
5. How to add a new agent - Step-by-step process
6. Testing procedures - How to run tests, validate output

Scan the src/ directory to understand actual structure, then write clear guide.

Target: 300-400 lines, practical and example-driven.
```

### Task 2: Create GLOSSARY.md (30 min)
**Agent Prompt**:
```
Create docs/GLOSSARY.md to define project-specific terms.

Terms to define (scan docs/ to understand each):
1. Pass - What does "4-pass pipeline" mean?
2. Librarian Agent - Python helper vs AI agent distinction
3. Research Bundle - Assembled context for synthesis
4. Macro/Micro Analysis - Telescopic approach explanation
5. Phonetic Transcription - Why it matters for commentary
6. Stress Marking - Linguistic feature explanation
7. Figurative Language Database - What it contains, how used
8. MasterEditor - GPT-5 o1 critical review role
9. Consonantal/Voweled/Exact/Lemma search - 4-layer concordance
10. Maqqef - Hebrew word joiner, stress domain implications
11. Begadkefat - Letters that change pronunciation
12. Gemination - Consonant doubling (dagesh forte)

Format: Alphabetical, clear definitions with examples.
Target: 150-200 lines.
```

### Task 3: Consolidate overview.md (30 min)
**Agent Prompt**:
```
Task: Consolidate docs/overview.md into existing documentation.

Steps:
1. Read docs/overview.md to understand its content
2. Read docs/CONTEXT.md to see what already exists
3. Extract any unique content from overview.md not in CONTEXT.md
4. If unique content exists, merge it into CONTEXT.md
5. Move overview.md to docs/archive/deprecated/
6. Update any cross-references pointing to overview.md â†’ redirect to CONTEXT.md

Use git mv to preserve history.
Return: Summary of what was merged, what was redundant.
```

### Task 4: Update Cross-References (15 min)
**Agent Prompt**:
```
Task: Update cross-references to point to new documentation structure.

Actions:
1. Search all .md files for references to:
   - ARCHITECTURE.md â†’ Should link to TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md
   - PHONETIC_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md â†’ Should link to PHONETIC_SYSTEM.md
   - PHONETIC_IMPLEMENTATION_EXAMPLE.md â†’ Should link to PHONETIC_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md
   - overview.md â†’ Should link to CONTEXT.md

2. Update README.md links if needed to reflect new structure

3. Add "See also" sections to related docs where helpful

Return: List of files modified with brief description of changes.
```

## Success Criteria

Phase 3 complete when:
- âœ… docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md exists and is comprehensive
- âœ… docs/GLOSSARY.md exists with all key terms defined
- âœ… docs/overview.md archived, unique content merged to CONTEXT.md
- âœ… All cross-references updated to point to correct files
- âœ… All changes committed with clear message

---

## After Phase 3: Optional Phase 4 Tasks

**Phase 4** (Low Priority - 1 hour):
- Create visual pipeline diagram (Mermaid or ASCII)
- Create documentation index (docs/INDEX.md)
- Final validation pass

See `docs/DOCUMENTATION_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md` lines 326-369 for Phase 4 details.
