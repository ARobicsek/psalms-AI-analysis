**Primary Sources:** PubMed-indexed peer-reviewed publications

---

## Executive Summary

Implementation science provides the theoretical frameworks, empirical evidence, and practical strategies needed to bridge the gap between efficacious healthcare innovations and their successful adoption in real-world clinical settings. This literature review synthesizes current evidence on implementation science and change management specifically relevant to deploying AI interventions in healthcare, with priority given to PubMed-indexed research.

### Key Findings:

**Major Frameworks:** Multiple complementary frameworks exist to guide implementation efforts, including RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance), CFIR (Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research), Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations, Normalization Process Theory (NPT), NASSS (Non-adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability), and the Theoretical Domains Framework. The updated CFIR (2022) and CFIR User Guide (2025) provide the most current comprehensive guidance. No single framework captures all aspects of implementation; successful projects often integrate multiple frameworks.

**Critical Barriers:** Research consistently identifies alert fatigue (with 90-95% CDSS override rates), lack of workflow integration, insufficient organizational readiness, resource constraints, knowledge gaps, and concerns about AI explainability and trust as major barriers to implementation success. A 2023 NASSS-informed scoping review identified 227 individual barriers and 130 facilitators across CDSS implementations (PMID: 37495997).

**Success Factors:** Evidence-based facilitators include early stakeholder engagement, integration with existing workflows, comprehensive training and support, strong leadership commitment, availability of implementation resources, and attention to local context adaptation while maintaining fidelity to core intervention components. Performance expectancy and facilitating conditions emerge as most consistent facilitators across AI implementations.

**Implementation Strategies:** The ERIC (Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change) compilation provides 73 discrete implementation strategies organized into nine domains (PMID: 25889199). Multifaceted, multilevel strategies tailored to specific contextual barriers consistently outperform single-strategy approaches. A 2023 systematic review found the most frequently tested strategies were Distribute Educational Materials (n=99), Conduct Educational Meetings (n=96), Audit and Provide Feedback (n=76), and External Facilitation (n=59) (PMID: 38915102).

**Sustainability:** Only 30-40% of implemented interventions are sustained beyond initial implementation. Sustainability requires explicit planning from project inception, ongoing stakeholder engagement, integration into routine workflows, demonstrated value to end-users, and continued resource allocation. A 2018 systematic review identified 62 sustainability approaches including 32 frameworks, 16 models, 8 tools, and 4 strategies (PMID: 29426341).

**AI-Specific Considerations:** AI implementation faces unique challenges including algorithmic opacity ("black box" problem), concerns about bias and fairness, data quality and interoperability issues, regulatory uncertainty, and the need for continuous model monitoring and updating. Recent frameworks include FUTURE-AI (2025, PMID: 39909534), SALIENT (2023, PMID: 37172264), and CPI-AI (2024, PMID: 39288942).

**Research Gaps:** Limited evidence exists on: implementation strategies specifically optimized for AI interventions, methods for balancing fidelity with necessary local adaptation of AI tools, approaches to sustaining AI interventions long-term, and strategies for scaling AI across diverse healthcare contexts while maintaining effectiveness and equity.

## 1. Major Implementation Science Frameworks

### 1.1 RE-AIM Framework

**Overview:**
The RE-AIM framework, one of the most widely used implementation science frameworks with over 2,800 publications as of 2019 (PMID: 30984733), provides a comprehensive structure for planning, conducting, and evaluating implementation efforts across five dimensions: Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance.

**Framework Components:**

- **Reach:** The absolute number, proportion, and representativeness of individuals who participate in a given initiative
- **Effectiveness:** The impact of an intervention on important outcomes, including potential negative effects, quality of life, and economic outcomes
- **Adoption:** The absolute number, proportion, and representativeness of settings and intervention agents who are willing to initiate a program
- **Implementation:** The intervention agents' fidelity to the various elements of an intervention's protocol, including consistency of delivery as intended and time and cost of the intervention
- **Maintenance:** The extent to which a program or policy becomes institutionalized or part of routine organizational practices and policies

**Foundational Publications:**
- Glasgow RE, Vogt TM, Boles SM. Evaluating the public health impact of health promotion interventions: the RE-AIM framework. Am J Public Health. 1999;89(9):1322-1327. **PMID: 10474547**
- Glasgow RE, Holtrop JS, Rabin BA. RE-AIM Planning and Evaluation Framework: Adapting to New Science and Practice With a 20-Year Review. Front Public Health. 2019;7:64. **PMID: 30984733**

**Recent Developments (2024):**

The PRISM (Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model) framework integrates with RE-AIM to provide enhanced contextual assessment. A February 2024 publication emphasizes the importance of understanding and responding to local contexts through an equity lens (PMID: 38408990). The RE-AIM "outcomes cascade" illustrates touch points of opportunity and gaps within and across each outcome dimension to address health disparities.

**Usage Patterns:**
Research shows that Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance are under-represented in the literature compared to Reach, suggesting the framework is not being used to its full potential. A 2019 review found RE-AIM used across diverse settings including clinical, community, and corporate contexts (PMID: 31824911).

**Applications to Healthcare IT:**
RE-AIM has been successfully applied to evaluate remote home care technologies, medication safety dashboards, patient portal implementations, and various telehealth interventions. A 2023 systematic review examined RE-AIM application to activity trackers in clinical care for chronic disease (PMID: 37955960).

### 1.2 Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR)

**Overview:**
The CFIR is a determinant framework that consolidates constructs from many implementation theories, models, and frameworks to predict or explain barriers and facilitators to implementation success. Originally published in 2009, CFIR was updated in 2022 based on 15 years of user feedback (PMID: 36309746).

**Framework Structure:**
CFIR provides a menu of constructs arranged across 5 domains:

1. **Intervention Characteristics:** Features of the intervention itself, including:
   - Intervention source (internally vs. externally developed)
   - Evidence strength and quality
   - Relative advantage over existing practices
   - Adaptability to local contexts
   - Trialability (ability to test on small scale)
   - Complexity
   - Design quality and packaging
   - Cost

2. **Outer Setting:** Economic, political, and social context within which an organization operates:
   - Patient needs and resources
   - Cosmopolitanism (degree of networking with external organizations)
   - Peer pressure
   - External policy and incentives

3. **Inner Setting:** Structural, political, and cultural contexts within the implementing organization:
   - Structural characteristics
   - Networks and communications
   - Culture
   - Implementation climate (shared receptivity)
   - Readiness for implementation

4. **Characteristics of Individuals:** The individuals involved with implementation:
   - Knowledge and beliefs about the intervention
   - Self-efficacy
   - Individual stage of change
   - Individual identification with organization
   - Other personal attributes

5. **Process:** Activities and strategies used to implement the intervention:
   - Planning
   - Engaging stakeholders
   - Executing implementation
   - Reflecting and evaluating

**Key Publications:**
- Damschroder LJ, et al. Fostering implementation of health services research findings into practice: a consolidated framework for advancing implementation science. Implement Sci. 2009;4:50. **PMID: 19664226**
- Damschroder LJ, et al. The updated Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research based on user feedback. Implement Sci. 2022;17(1):75. **PMID: 36309746**
- Kirk MA, et al. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) User Guide: a five-step guide for conducting implementation research using the framework. Implement Sci. 2025;20:5. **PMID: 40819067**

**2022 Updates:**
The updated CFIR refined construct definitions, reorganized the framework based on user feedback, and better centers innovation recipients. Changes address important critiques including better centering innovation recipients and adding determinants to equity in implementation.

**CFIR Outcomes Addendum (2022):**
Published to address recommendations to include outcomes in the framework, the CFIR Outcomes Addendum (PMID: 35065675) clarifies the relationship between CFIR constructs and implementation outcomes.

**CFIR User Guide (2025):**
A comprehensive five-step guide published in January 2025 (PMID: 40819067) covers:
1. Study Design
2. Data Collection
3. Data Analysis
4. Data Interpretation
5. Knowledge Dissemination

**Systematic Review Evidence:**
A 2016 systematic review found great breadth in CFIR application across a wide variety of study objectives, settings, and units of analysis (PMID: 27189233). While CFIR has most often been used within healthcare settings, it has also been applied across diverse contexts including low-income countries. A 2020 systematic review proposed adding a "Characteristics of Systems" domain and 11 novel constructs to increase compatibility for use in LMICs (PMID: 32164692).

**Applications:**
Studies demonstrate CFIR's utility in nursing practice (PMID: 26269693), asthma shared decision making (PMID: 31868043), vaccination programs (PMID: 31424313), and patient-centered care transformations (PMID: 31989028).

**Resources:**
The official CFIR website (cfirguide.org) provides technical assistance, interview guides, codebooks, and tools for using the framework effectively.

### 1.3 Diffusion of Innovations Theory (Rogers)

**Overview:**
Diffusion of Innovations theory, developed by Everett Rogers (first published 1962), seeks to explain how, why, and at what rate new ideas and technologies spread through populations. The theory has been extensively applied to healthcare IT implementations.

**Core Concepts:**

**Innovation-Decision Process:**
Rogers identified five stages through which individuals pass when deciding to adopt an innovation:
1. Knowledge: Learning about the innovation's existence and function
2. Persuasion: Forming favorable or unfavorable attitudes
3. Decision: Choosing to adopt or reject
4. Implementation: Putting the innovation to use
5. Confirmation: Seeking reinforcement of the decision

**Perceived Attributes of Innovations:**
Five factors influence whether an innovation will be successfully adopted:

1. **Relative Advantage:** The degree to which an innovation is perceived as better than the idea it supersedes
2. **Compatibility:** Consistency with existing values, past experiences, and needs of potential adopters
3. **Complexity:** Perceived difficulty of understanding and using the innovation
4. **Trialability:** Ability to experiment with the innovation on a limited basis
5. **Observability:** The degree to which results of the innovation are visible to others

**Adopter Categories:**
Rogers identified five adopter categories based on timing of adoption:
- Innovators (2.5%): Technology enthusiasts, risk-takers
- Early Adopters (13.5%): Opinion leaders, judicious adopters
- Early Majority (34%): Pragmatic, deliberate decision-makers
- Late Majority (34%): Skeptical, adopt due to peer pressure
- Laggards (16%): Traditional, resistant to change

**Key Publications:**
- Rogers EM. Diffusion of Innovations. 5th ed. New York: Free Press; 2003.
- Greenhalgh T, Robert G, Macfarlane F, Bate P, Kyriakidou O. Diffusion of innovations in service organizations: systematic review and recommendations. Milbank Q. 2004;82(4):581-629. **PMID: 15595944**
- Dearing JW, Cox JG. Diffusion Of Innovations Theory, Principles, And Practice. Health Aff. 2018;37(2):183-190. **PMID: 29401011**

**Healthcare Applications:**
A 2021 study found the DOI model applicable to public health for both explanatory and interventionist purposes, building on a staged model of awareness, persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation (PMID: 34058897).

Recent applications include:
- Electronic health record implementations
- Patient portal adoption (PMID: 25885110)
- Digital innovations diffusion across 13 medical specialties (PMID: 38262012)
- Big data analytics in healthcare (PMID: 31423120)

**Healthcare IT Insights:**
A 2012 systematic review (PMID: 12146784) found that three clusters of influence affect diffusion rate: perceptions of the innovation, characteristics of individuals who may adopt the change, and contextual and managerial factors within the organization.

**Challenges Identified:**
There is a widely acknowledged time lag between innovation and widespread use across health systems. New scientific knowledge and innovation are often slow to disseminate, while providers sometimes rush to adopt innovations based on limited evidence (PMID: 26643638).

**Implications for AI Implementation:**
- AI tools must demonstrate clear relative advantage over existing workflows
- Integration with existing systems (compatibility) is critical
- Reducing perceived complexity through user-friendly interfaces is essential
- Pilot testing (trialability) can build confidence
- Sharing success stories (observability) facilitates spread

### 1.4 NASSS Framework

**Overview:**
The NASSS (Non-adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability) framework was developed specifically to analyze technology-supported change in healthcare, addressing why health and care technologies often fail to achieve their potential at scale.

**Original Framework:**
The final NASSS framework includes questions in 7 domains: the condition or illness, the technology, the value proposition, the adopter system (comprising professional staff, patient, and lay caregivers), the organization(s), the wider (institutional and societal) context, and the interaction and mutual adaptation between all these domains over time.

**Primary Publication:**
- Greenhalgh T, Wherton J, Papoutsi C, et al. Beyond Adoption: A New Framework for Theorizing and Evaluating Nonadoption, Abandonment, and Challenges to the Scale-Up, Spread, and Sustainability of Health and Care Technologies. J Med Internet Res. 2017;19(11):e367. **PMID: 29092808**

**NASSS Framework Synthesis:**
A 2019 review described NASSS as a synthesis of multiple theories of technology implementation, integrating diffusion of innovations, organizational theory, and complexity science (PMID: 31411163).

**NASSS-CAT Tools:**
The NASSS Complexity Assessment Tool (NASSS-CAT) was developed for understanding, guiding, monitoring, and researching technology implementation projects. A 2020 protocol described evaluation in real-world settings (PMID: 32401224).

**Recent Applications:**

1. **CDSS Implementation (2023):** A scoping review identified barriers and facilitators to CDSS implementation in hospitals using the NASSS framework. The study found 227 individual barriers and 130 facilitators across 44 studies, with most falling into "Technology," "Organization," and "Adopters" domains. Most commonly reported barriers were fit with workflows (19 studies), usefulness of output (17 studies), technical dependencies (16 studies), and trust in input data (15 studies). **PMID: 37495997**

2. **Digital Twins in Cardiovascular Medicine (2023):** Study used NASSS to identify barriers and facilitators for implementing digital twins (PMID: 37514627).

3. **Automated Evidence Synthesis (2024):** Application of NASSS to evaluate automated evidence synthesis in health behaviour change (PMID: 38456322).

4. **Bottom-Up Innovations (2024):** Multiple-case study using NASSS-CAT to explore complexity in health care technology bottom-up innovations (PMID: 38669076).

**Scoping Review (2025):**
A January 2025 scoping review examined NASSS framework use over time. While NASSS is gaining popularity as an evidence-based, theory-informed tool, its use has not been systematically described (PMID: 40096260).

**Ex Post Theorisation:**
The NASSS framework can be applied retrospectively to generate rich, contextualized narratives of technology-supported change efforts, as demonstrated in the TORPEDO programme analysis (PMID: 31888718).

### 1.5 Normalization Process Theory (NPT)

**Overview:**
NPT is a middle-range sociological theory that identifies, characterizes, and explains key mechanisms that promote and inhibit the implementation, embedding, and integration of new health techniques, technologies, and complex interventions. NPT focuses on what people do rather than what they believe or intend.

**Core Constructs:**

NPT comprises four generative mechanisms through which implementation, embedding, and integration are accomplished:

1. **Coherence (Sense-Making Work):** How people individually and collectively make sense of a new practice
   - Differentiation: Understanding how the practice differs from existing practices
   - Communal specification: Building shared understanding of aims, objectives, and expected benefits
   - Individual specification: Understanding individual tasks and responsibilities
   - Internalization: Potential for users to grasp benefits, value, and importance

2. **Cognitive Participation (Relational Work):** How people engage with and commit to the new practice
   - Initiation: Key individuals driving implementation forward
   - Enrolment: Organizing others to engage with the practice
   - Legitimation: Stakeholders believing the practice should be part of their work
   - Activation: Defining procedures to sustain the practice

3. **Collective Action (Operational Work):** The work people do to enact the new practice
   - Interactional workability: How the practice affects interactions between people
   - Relational integration: How it affects confidence and trust in the new practice
   - Skill set workability: How it affects the division of labor and work allocation
   - Contextual integration: How organizational resources support the practice

4. **Reflexive Monitoring (Appraisal Work):** How people assess and understand the effects of the new practice
   - Systematization: Determining effectiveness through structured or informal evaluation
   - Communal appraisal: Collective assessment of how the practice affects them and others
   - Individual appraisal: Personal assessment of advantages, disadvantages, and implications
   - Reconfiguration: Modifying practices in response to appraisal

**Key Publications:**

**NoMAD Instrument:**
The Normalization MeAsure Development (NoMAD) instrument was developed and validated to assess implementation work based on NPT (PMID: 30442094). This provides a quantitative tool for NPT-based assessment.

**Systematic Review Findings:**
A 2018 systematic review found NPT used across 110 complex intervention studies, with researchers finding it useful for understanding dynamic implementation processes. NPT was particularly valuable for understanding why well-designed interventions sometimes fail to become routinized (PMID: 29879986).

A 2014 qualitative systematic review of 29 studies found NPT effectively used to aid intervention development, implementation planning, and understanding implementation processes (PMID: 24383661).

**Applications in Healthcare:**

1. **Health Informatics Systems:** NPT used to understand organizational behaviour change during health informatics implementation (PMID: 31411162)

2. **Enhanced Recovery After Surgery:** Qualitative exploration using NPT to understand sense-making in ERAS implementation (PMID: 29668717)

3. **Clinical Decision Support:** NPT applied to understand workflow implications of decision support across diverse primary care settings (PMID: 31630113)

4. **Discharge Planning:** Process evaluation using NPT (PMID: 27121500)

5. **Primary Care Settings (UK):** A 2020 systematic review examined NPT application in UK primary care settings (PMID: 32178624)

**NPT Toolkit:**
The official NPT Online Toolkit (normalization-process-theory.northumbria.ac.uk) provides validated questionnaires, coding manuals, case study templates, and planning guides.

**Relevance to AI Implementation:**
NPT is particularly relevant for AI implementations because:
- AI tools require significant sense-making work (coherence)
- Securing clinician buy-in and engagement is critical (cognitive participation)
- AI integration affects multiple work processes and roles (collective action)
- Ongoing monitoring and refinement are essential for AI systems (reflexive monitoring)

### 1.6 Organizational Readiness for Change (Weiner)

**Overview:**
Weiner's theory of organizational readiness for change provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and assessing whether organizations are prepared to implement new initiatives successfully.

**Core Definition:**
Organizational readiness for change refers to organizational members' shared resolve to implement a change (change commitment) and shared belief in their collective capability to do so (change efficacy).

**Foundational Publications:**
- Weiner BJ. A theory of organizational readiness for change. Implement Sci. 2009;4:67. **PMID: 19840381**
- Weiner BJ, Amick H, Lee SY. Conceptualization and measurement of organizational readiness for change: a review of the literature in health services research and other fields. Med Care Res Rev. 2008;65(4):379-436. **PMID: 18511812**
- Shea CM, Jacobs SR, Esserman DA, Bruce K, Weiner BJ. Organizational readiness for implementing change: a psychometric assessment of a new measure. Implement Sci. 2014;9:7. **PMID: 24410955**

**Two Key Components:**

1. **Change Commitment:** The shared resolve among organizational members to pursue courses of action involved in change implementation

2. **Change Efficacy:** The shared belief in collective capability to organize and execute courses of action involved in change implementation

**Determinants of Readiness:**

Organizational readiness varies as a function of:

1. **Change Valence:** How much organizational members value the change
   - Perceived benefits and costs
   - Alignment with organizational mission and values
   - Impact on role and status

2. **Three Key Determinants of Implementation Capability:**

   a. **Task Demands:**
   - Complexity of implementation tasks
   - Number of separate tasks
   - Required coordination and integration

   b. **Resource Availability:**
   - Time allocated for implementation
   - Money and equipment
   - Information and knowledge
   - Staff and space

   c. **Situational Factors:**
   - Competing organizational priorities
   - External mandates and pressures
   - Leadership support and involvement
   - Past experiences with change

**Empirical Evidence:**

A 2018 acute care hospital study found that nursing foundation for quality of care and supportive leadership were positively associated with readiness, and organizational readiness scores are positively associated with supportive leadership and a foundation for quality of care (PMID: 30019540).

A 2019 study examined nurses' views of organizational readiness in acute care settings (PMID: 31571258).

**Clinical Information Systems:**
Research on clinical information system projects found that change appropriateness, organizational flexibility, vision clarity, and change efficacy explained 75% of the variance in organizational readiness (PMID: 21356080).

**Systematic Review (2017):**
A study protocol described predicting implementation from organizational readiness for change (PMID: 21777479).

**Measurement:**
The Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change (ORIC) scale was developed based on Weiner's theory. This validated instrument measures both change commitment and change efficacy components (PMID: 24410955).

**Relevance to AI Implementation:**
For AI interventions, organizational readiness assessment should examine:
- Belief in AI's value for improving care (change valence)
- IT infrastructure and technical capacity (resources)
- Staff digital literacy and AI understanding (capability)
- Leadership support for AI adoption (situational factors)
- Alignment with organizational strategy (change valence)

### 1.7 Implementation Outcomes Framework (Proctor)

**Overview:**
Proctor and colleagues' 2011 framework provides a taxonomy of eight conceptually distinct implementation outcomes that serve as indicators of implementation success and are distinct from service system and clinical outcomes.

**Seminal Publication:**
- Proctor E, Silmere H, Raghavan R, et al. Outcomes for implementation research: conceptual distinctions, measurement challenges, and research agenda. Adm Policy Ment Health. 2011;38(2):65-76. **PMID: 20957426**

**The Three Outcome Types:**

1. **Implementation Outcomes:** Effects of deliberate and purposive actions to implement new treatments, practices, and services

2. **Service System Outcomes:** Efficiency, safety, effectiveness, equity, patient-centeredness, and timeliness of services

3. **Client Outcomes:** Health status, function, and satisfaction

**The Eight Implementation Outcomes:**

1. **Acceptability:** Perception among implementation stakeholders that a given treatment, service, practice, or innovation is agreeable, palatable, or satisfactory

2. **Adoption:** Intention, initial decision, or action to try or employ an innovation or evidence-based practice

3. **Appropriateness:** Perceived fit, relevance, or compatibility of the innovation or evidence-based practice for a given practice setting, provider, or consumer

4. **Feasibility:** Extent to which a new treatment, or an innovation, can be successfully used or carried out within a given agency or setting

5. **Fidelity:** Degree to which an intervention was implemented as it was prescribed in the original protocol or as intended by program developers

6. **Implementation Cost:** Cost impact of an implementation effort (time, money, resources)

7. **Penetration:** Integration of a practice within a service setting and its subsystems (also called "reach" in organizational settings)

8. **Sustainability:** Extent to which a newly implemented treatment is maintained or institutionalized within a service setting's ongoing, stable operations

**Ten-Year Impact:**
A 2023 scoping review of implementation outcomes research found the Proctor framework has become the most widely cited outcomes framework in implementation science. The full-text review yielded 400 manuscripts that met inclusion criteria assessing at least one implementation outcome. Acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity are most frequently measured, while penetration and implementation cost are least frequently assessed. **PMID: 37491242**

**Applications to AI:**
For AI interventions, implementation outcomes assessment should include:
- **Acceptability:** Do clinicians find the AI tool acceptable to use?
- **Adoption:** What proportion of eligible clinicians begin using the AI?
- **Appropriateness:** Is the AI well-matched to clinical needs and workflows?
- **Feasibility:** Can the AI be reliably deployed with available infrastructure?
- **Fidelity:** Is the AI used as intended (not subverted or overridden)?
- **Cost:** What resources are required for implementation?
- **Penetration:** How deeply does AI use penetrate across settings and users?
- **Sustainability:** Is AI use maintained over time?

### 1.8 Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF)

**Overview:**
The TDF is an integrative framework synthesizing 128 theoretical constructs from 33 behavior change theories judged most relevant to implementation questions. It was developed through collaboration between behavioral scientists and implementation researchers.

**Key Publications:**
- Cane J, O'Connor D, Michie S. Validation of the theoretical domains framework for use in behaviour change and implementation research. Implement Sci. 2012;7:37. **PMID: 22530986**
- Atkins L, Francis J, Islam R, et al. A guide to using the Theoretical Domains Framework of behaviour change to investigate implementation problems. Implement Sci. 2017;12(1):77. **PMID: 28637486**

**The 14 Domains:**

1. Knowledge
2. Skills
3. Social/Professional Role and Identity
4. Beliefs about Capabilities
5. Optimism
6. Beliefs about Consequences
7. Reinforcement
8. Intentions
9. Goals
10. Memory, Attention and Decision Processes
11. Environmental Context and Resources
12. Social Influences
13. Emotion
14. Behavioural Regulation

**Applications:**
The TDF can be used across the implementation lifecycle for assessment, intervention design, and evaluation. Studies demonstrate TDF's utility in investigating implementation problems for diverse interventions including clinical guidelines, antibiotic stewardship, hand hygiene, screening programs, and health IT systems.

## 2. Barriers to Implementation in Healthcare

### 2.1 Barriers to Clinical Practice Change and Evidence-Based Practice

Extensive systematic research identifies multilevel barriers impeding translation of evidence into clinical practice:

**Major Systematic Reviews:**

**2023 Umbrella Review:**
An umbrella review of qualitative and quantitative literature found 193 barriers and 140 facilitators to clinical practice guideline (CPG) implementation across six categories: (1) political, social and culture factors, (2) institutional environment and resources factors, (3) guideline itself related factors, (4) healthcare provider-related factors, (5) patient-related factors and (6) behavioural regulation-related factors. **PMID: 37657616**

**2020 Systematic Metareview:**
Most commonly reported barriers included suboptimal healthcare networks and interprofessional communication pathways, time constraints, poor applicability of CPGs in real-world practice, lack of knowledge and skills, poor motivations and adherence, and inadequate reinforcement. For guideline characteristics, barriers included impracticality, complexity, and inaccessibility. **PMID: 32600417**

**2023 Overview:**
An overview of systematic reviews on implementing CPGs in primary care found frequently reported enablers included presence of technical support and timely education and training for both primary care providers and patients. **PMID: 36609329**

**Individual Clinician Barriers:**

1. **Knowledge and Skills Gaps:**
   - Uncertainty or lack of knowledge about evidence-based practice
   - Insufficient skills in critiquing and appraising literature
   - Lack of training in implementation science concepts
   - Time mismanagement and competing priorities

2. **Attitudinal Barriers:**
   - Resistance to changing established practices
   - Skepticism about research applicability
   - Low motivation to adopt new practices
   - Preference for tradition over evidence

3. **Authority and Autonomy:**
   - Lack of authority identified as most important factor
   - Limited decision-making authority in practice changes
   - Insufficient power to implement changes

**Organizational Barriers:**

1. **Resource Constraints:**
   - Lack of time is most frequently cited barrier
   - Insufficient staffing levels
   - Lack of finances and material resources
   - Poor access to necessary equipment

2. **Cultural and Climate Issues:**
   - Organizational cultural resistance
   - Absence of formalized protocols
   - Lack of organizational priority
   - Non-supportive workplace culture

3. **Access to Evidence:**
   - Limited access to latest research
   - Difficulty accessing databases
   - Lack of logistical support for searches
   - Information overload

4. **Leadership and Support:**
   - Inadequate administrative support
   - Lack of champions and opinion leaders
   - Insufficient leadership commitment
   - Absence of mentorship

**Nursing-Specific Barriers:**
Multiple studies show nurses' lack of authority is the biggest barrier to implementing research findings. A 2017 integrative review identified barriers and facilitators to nurses' use of clinical practice guidelines (PMID: 27297368).

### 2.2 Barriers Specific to CDSS and Healthcare IT

**Alert Fatigue and Override Rates:**

One of the most critical barriers to CDSS success is alert fatigue, with alarming statistics:
- **90-95% of alerts are overridden** in typical CDSS implementations
- Studies report override rates ranging from 77% to 96%
- Only 7.3% of alerts in one study were deemed clinically appropriate

**Alert Fatigue Evidence:**

**2023 Scoping Review (NASSS Framework):**

### 10.3 Final Thoughts

The gap between AI's demonstrated potential and its realized impact in healthcare is fundamentally an implementation gap. Brilliant algorithms deployed poorly achieve nothing; good algorithms deployed well can transform care.

Implementation science provides the frameworks, evidence, and strategies needed to bridge this gap. The updated CFIR (PMID: 36309746), comprehensive ERIC strategies (PMID: 25889199), and emerging AI-specific frameworks (FUTURE-AI, SALIENT, CPI-AI) offer evidence-based guidance. However, AI's unique characteristics—its opacity, dynamism, data dependencies, and equity implications—require thoughtful adaptation of implementation science principles, not their uncritical application.

The evidence is clear:
- **Alert fatigue is real:** 90-95% override rates undermine poorly designed systems (PMID: 28395667)
- **Barriers are multilevel:** 227 barriers identified across CDSS implementations (PMID: 37495997)
- **Context matters:** What works in one setting may fail in another (PMID: 32600396)
- **Equity is essential:** Implementation must center equity from the outset (PMID: 35101088)
- **Sustainability is challenging:** Only 30-40% of interventions sustained without explicit planning
- **Champions make a difference:** With mandate, time, and training, champions facilitate adoption (PMID: 38605304)

Success requires:
- **Humility:** Recognizing implementation complexity and learning from failures
- **Patience:** Understanding implementation takes years, not months
- **Rigor:** Systematically applying implementation science frameworks
- **Equity:** Centering fairness and justice, not treating them as afterthoughts
- **Pragmatism:** Using frameworks as tools, not dogma
- **Persistence:** Sustaining commitment through inevitable challenges

As AI becomes increasingly central to healthcare, implementation science must evolve alongside it. The field needs AI-specific implementation frameworks, strategies, and measures. It needs evidence from diverse settings and populations. It needs to grapple with unique AI challenges around explainability, bias, and continuous learning.

But the fundamental principles endure: understand context, engage stakeholders, address multilevel barriers, monitor and adapt, and plan for sustainability. Organizations that embrace these principles and invest in rigorous implementation will realize AI's potential to improve health and healthcare. Those that don't will join the long list of promising innovations that failed to achieve impact—not because they didn't work, but because they weren't implemented well.

The evidence base is growing. The frameworks are available. The strategies are tested. The choice is ours to make.
