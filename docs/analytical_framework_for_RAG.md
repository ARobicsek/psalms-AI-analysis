Concepts and Analytical Frameworks for Biblical Poetry: A Foundational Document for the Telescopic Analysis of the PsalmsPreamble: Purpose and Methodological StanceThis document serves as the core knowledge base for an AI-powered commentary pipeline, designed to facilitate a literary-poetic analysis of the Book of Psalms. Its structure is optimized for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to provide precise, context-rich information on the artistic conventions of biblical Hebrew poetry. The methodological stance is inspired by the literary approach of scholars like Robert Alter, which treats the biblical text as a work of sophisticated literary art.1 This framework posits that poetic form is not a decorative embellishment but the primary vehicle of meaning and theological expression.3 The objective is to equip analytical agents to move beyond surface-level paraphrase to a "telescopic analysis"—a method that connects micro-level poetic devices (e.g., a single word choice, a metaphor) to the macro-level thematic and theological arguments of an entire psalm.I. The Foundational Principle: ParallelismParallelism is the most fundamental and pervasive organizing principle of biblical Hebrew poetry.5 An analysis of its dynamic nature is the prerequisite for any meaningful literary interpretation. It is a "seconding sequence" where the relationship between the parts of a line, rather than rhyme or a strict meter, creates the poetic effect.6The Dynamics of Parallelism: Defining the "A is so, and what's more, B" PrincipleThe core dynamic of parallelism is not simple repetition but a progression of thought, aptly summarized by the principle "A is so, and what's more, B." In this model, the second part of a poetic line, or colon, dynamically engages with the first. It can confirm, sharpen, specify, intensify, contrast, or complete the initial statement.4 This functional understanding represents a significant development from earlier, more static classificatory approaches, which identified types of parallelism but often under-analyzed their rhetorical purpose.2 The energy of a poetic line sweeps from the first colon to the second, creating a forward momentum that can develop an argument or unfold "miniature stories".4 This principle forces the reader—or an AI agent—to locate the primary locus of meaning in the relationship between the cola, treating them not as isolated statements but as an integrated, developing thought.10 It is the essential "rhyme of thought" that defines Hebrew verse.11Synonymous ParallelismConcept Name: Synonymous ParallelismDefinition: A form of parallelism where the second colon restates, echoes, or reinforces the thought of the first colon using different but semantically equivalent words or concepts.5Function in Poetry: The function of synonymous parallelism is rarely simple tautology. It serves to reinforce and amplify an idea, adding emotional depth and aesthetic beauty that makes the message more memorable and impactful.12 Frequently, the second colon achieves this by intensifying the first or by moving from a general term to a more specific or concrete image, making the concept more pointed and forceful.7 This progression from general to particular is a key dynamic of biblical poetry.Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 19:1: "הַשָּׁמַיִם מְסַפְּרִים כְּבוֹד-אֵל // וּמַעֲשֵׂה יָדָיו מַגִּיד הָרָקִיעַ."6Psalm 24:1: "לַיהוָה הָאָרֶץ וּמְלוֹאָהּ // תֵּבֵל וְיֹשְׁבֵי בָהּ."13Psalm 120:2: "יְהוָה הַצִּילָה נַפְשִׁי מִשְּׂפַת-שֶׁקֶר // מִלָּשׁוֹן רְמִיָּה."12Analytical Questions:How does the second colon restate the first? Does it use direct synonyms or related concepts?Does the second colon specify, intensify, or make the first more concrete? If so, what is the effect of this shift?What nuances of meaning are introduced by the specific word choices in the second colon that are not present in the first?Does the second line simply repeat the first, or does it heighten the idea or emotion?Antithetic ParallelismConcept Name: Antithetic ParallelismDefinition: A form of parallelism where the second colon presents a thought that is in direct contrast or opposition to the first.5 The contrast is often, but not always, marked by a conjunction such as "but".11Function in Poetry: This device sharpens an idea by defining it against its opposite. The use of opposites clarifies both extremes, creating a starker focus on the desired message and forcing a moral or theological choice.16 It is a favored device in wisdom literature for framing the two paths of life—for example, righteousness versus wickedness, or wisdom versus folly—thereby creating tension and emphasizing the consequences of a decision.5Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 1:6: "כִּי-יוֹדֵעַ יְהוָה דֶּרֶךְ צַדִּיקִים // וְדֶרֶךְ רְשָׁעִים תֹּאבֵד."11Psalm 20:7: "אֵלֶּה בָרֶכֶב וְאֵלֶּה בַסּוּסִים // וַאֲנַחְנוּ בְּשֵׁם-יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ נַזְכִּיר."20Psalm 34:10: "כְּפִירִים רָשׁוּ וְרָעֵבוּ // וְדֹרְשֵׁי יְהוָה לֹא-יַחְסְרוּ כָל-טוֹב."16Analytical Questions:What two concepts, paths, or outcomes are being contrasted in this verse?How does the contrast in the second colon clarify or sharpen the meaning of the first?What is the central idea that is being defined by this opposition?Is the contrast marked by a conjunction like "but," or is it implied by the juxtaposition of the two lines?Synthetic (or Climactic/Staircase) ParallelismConcept Name: Synthetic (or Climactic/Staircase) ParallelismDefinition: A form of parallelism where the second colon does not restate or contrast the first but instead builds upon, extends, or completes its thought.5 The climactic or "staircase" variation is a specific type where a key word or phrase from the first colon is repeated in the second, which then adds new information to build toward a climax or completion.8Function in Poetry: This form creates narrative or logical progression within the poetic line itself, developing an argument, explaining a cause and effect, or building emotional intensity step-by-step.23 It is the most explicit embodiment of the "A is so, and what's more, B" principle, as the second line carries the thought of the first to its conclusion.Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 29:1-2: "הָבוּ לַיהוָה בְּנֵי אֵלִים // הָבוּ לַיהוָה כָּבוֹד וָעֹז. // הָבוּ לַיהוָה כְּבוֹד שְׁמוֹ..."23Psalm 14:2: "יְהוָה מִשָּׁמַיִם הִשְׁקִיף עַל-בְּנֵי-אָדָם // לִרְאוֹת הֲיֵשׁ מַשְׂכִּיל דֹּרֵשׁ אֶת-אֱלֹהִים."22Psalm 96:1-2: "שִׁירוּ לַיהוָה שִׁיר חָדָשׁ // שִׁירוּ לַיהוָה כָּל-הָאָרֶץ. // שִׁירוּ לַיהוָה בָּרְכוּ שְׁמוֹ..."20Analytical Questions:How does the second colon build upon or complete the thought of the first?Is there a cause-and-effect relationship, a question-and-answer, or a sequential development being presented?In climactic forms, what key term is repeated, and what new information is added to create a sense of rising intensity or completion?How does this progression contribute to the overall argument of the psalm?II. Poetic Diction: Economy and ConcretenessThe characteristic style of Hebrew poetry favors compact expression and tangible imagery, creating a discourse that is both dense and emotionally resonant.Terseness & ConcisenessConcept Name: Terseness & ConcisenessDefinition: A primary characteristic of biblical Hebrew poetry is its compressed and economical use of language, employing a minimum of words to express complex ideas.2 This is often achieved through the omission of common prose particles (such as the definite article or direct object marker) and conjunctions, and through the use of ellipsis, where a word from the first colon (frequently the verb) is omitted but understood in the second.6Function in Poetry: Terseness creates a heightened, dense form of discourse that focuses attention on the most semantically important words.2 By omitting explicit logical connectors, the poet forces the reader to deduce the relationship between cola from the parallel structure itself, thereby empowering the function of parallelism. This word economy also contributes to the accentual rhythm of the verse by keeping lines short and impactful.2 Imagery, in this context, becomes a primary tool for compactness, allowing the poet to communicate a rich message in very few words.14Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 114:4: "הֶהָרִים רָקְדוּ כְאֵילִים // גְּבָעוֹת כִּבְנֵי-צֹאן."25Psalm 23:1: "יְהוָה רֹעִי // לֹא אֶחְסָר."Psalm 1:3: "וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל-פַּלְגֵי מָיִם // אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ."Analytical Questions:Are there words (especially verbs or conjunctions) from the first colon that are omitted but implied in the second? What is the effect of this ellipsis?How does the economy of words force a greater focus on the key nouns and verbs that are present?Does the terseness create ambiguity, or does it sharpen the focus and impact of the verse?How does the poet use a single image to convey a complex idea concisely?Concrete ImageryConcept Name: Concrete ImageryDefinition: Hebrew poetry demonstrates a marked preference for conveying theological ideas, emotional states, and moral principles through concrete, physical, and sensory images rather than through abstract philosophical or theological language.29 The ancient Hebrew imagination engaged the world not through abstract categories but through the empirical knowledge of lived experience—the life of shepherds, warriors, farmers, and priests.3Function in Poetry: Concrete images make abstract concepts tangible, emotionally resonant, and memorable.15 They ground theological claims in the physical world, allowing the poet to explore complex spiritual states through a shared, sensory vocabulary. Transforming a general term into a concrete image makes the idea "more pointed, more forceful".9 This imagery is not merely ornamental but functional, expressing significant themes and conveying implicit value judgments.30 For example, the choice between pastoral, military, or cultic imagery frames the psalmist's problem and the desired divine response.Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 18:2: "יְהוָה סַלְעִי וּמְצוּדָתִי וּמְפַלְטִי // אֵלִי צוּרִי אֶחֱסֶה-בּוֹ // מָגִנִּי וְקֶרֶן-יִשְׁעִי מִשְׂגַּבִּי."25Psalm 23:1-3: "יְהוָה רֹעִי... בִּנְאוֹת דֶּשֶׁא יַרְבִּיצֵנִי עַל-מֵי מְנֻחוֹת יְנַהֲלֵנִי..."33Psalm 1:3: "וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל-פַּלְgֵי מָיִם..."34Analytical Questions:What concrete, physical image is being used in this verse? What senses does it appeal to (sight, sound, touch)?What abstract theological, emotional, or moral concept does this image represent?What specific attributes of the concrete image are being mapped onto the abstract concept (e.g., a rock's stability, a shield's protection, a tree's fruitfulness)?How does the domain of the imagery (e.g., nature, warfare, temple cult) contribute to the overall argument or emotional tone of the psalm?III. The Music of Language: Sound and WordplayThese devices leverage the phonetic qualities of the Hebrew language to create artistic effects that enhance meaning and memorability. While often lost in translation, an awareness of their function is crucial for appreciating the original artistry.ParonomasiaConcept Name: ParonomasiaDefinition: The use of words that are similar in sound but different in meaning to create a "wordplay" or "pun".35 It is a deliberate juxtaposition of like-sounding words that draws the reader's attention to a particular statement or connection.37Function in Poetry: Paronomasia forges an associative link between two otherwise disparate concepts, prompting the reader to consider their relationship. It adds a layer of wit, memorability, and rhetorical force, often underscoring a solemn or important statement that might otherwise be overlooked.35Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 56:8: "נֹדִי סָפַרְתָּה-אָתָּה // שִׂימָה דִמְעָתִי בְנֹאדֶךָ." The similar sounds of the Hebrew words for "my wanderings" ($nōdî$) and "in your bottle" ($bənōdekā$) phonetically link the cause (wandering) with the effect (tears) that God is said to collect and remember.35Psalm 96:5: "כִּי כָּל-אֱלֹהֵי הָעַמִּים אֱלִילִים // וַיהוָה שָׁמַיִם עָשָׂה." This is a common prophetic wordplay contrasting the true God ($'elohim$) with "worthless things" ($'elilim$).Analytical Questions:(For Hebrew text analysis) Are there words in close proximity that share similar root consonants or sounds but have different meanings?What new connection or idea is suggested by the phonetic link between these words?How does this wordplay contribute to the verse's rhetorical force, memorability, or theological argument?Alliteration & AssonanceConcept Name: Alliteration & AssonanceDefinition: Alliteration is the repetition of the same or similar consonant sounds in nearby words, typically at the beginning of words. Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds within nearby words.38 While not a primary structural principle in Hebrew poetry, these sound devices are common and are used for aesthetic and emphatic effect.25Function in Poetry: These devices enhance the musicality and oral-aural quality of the poetry, making it more pleasing to the ear and more memorable.38 They can be used to link key words together, create emphasis on a particular phrase, and contribute to the emotional texture of a line. The sound itself can be mimetic, with the phonetic quality reinforcing the semantic meaning (e.g., harsh sounds for judgment, soft sounds for lament).41Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 29:1: In the Hebrew phrase kavod vā'oz (כָּבוֹד וָעֹז), the repetition of the 'o' vowel sound is an example of assonance.42Psalm 122:6: Sha'alu shalom Yerushalayim (שַׁאֲלוּ שְׁלוֹם יְרוּשָׁלָ‍ִם) features prominent alliteration of the 'sh' ($š$) and 'l' sounds.Psalm 6:6 (Hebrew 6:7): 'aśḥeh bəkol-laylāh miṭṭātî (אַשְׂחֶה בְכָל-לַיְלָה מִטָּתִי). The line is rich with sibilant 's' ($s/ś$) sounds, phonetically mimicking the sound of weeping or sighing.Analytical Questions:(For Hebrew text analysis) Is there a noticeable repetition of a particular consonant or vowel sound in this line or verse?Which words are linked by this sound repetition, and what is the significance of that link?How does the sound itself (e.g., a harsh guttural vs. a soft sibilant) contribute to the mood or meaning of the line?IV. Figurative Language: The Architecture of MeaningThis section covers devices that convey meaning by describing one thing in terms of another, creating rich layers of significance and enabling the poet to articulate complex truths.Metaphor & SimileConcept Name: Metaphor & SimileDefinition: Both are figures of speech that draw a comparison between two essentially different things to highlight a point of similarity. A simile makes the comparison explicit by using a comparative term such as "like" or "as." A metaphor makes the comparison implicitly, often by stating that A is B.34 While formally distinct, their poetic function is largely the same: to generate new understanding through analogy.44Function in Poetry: Metaphor and simile are central to poetic expression, transforming abstract concepts into concrete, understandable, and memorable images.34 They function by inviting the reader to transfer attributes from a familiar source domain (e.g., a shepherd) to a less familiar target domain (e.g., God) to generate new insight.44 They are the primary linguistic tools for expressing the ineffable nature of God and the depth of human spiritual experience, which defy literal description.15Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Simile: Psalm 1:3: "וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל-פַּלְגֵי מָיִם..."25Simile: Psalm 42:1: "כְּאַיָּל תַּעֲרֹג עַל-אֲפִיקֵי-מָיִם כֵּן נַפְשִׁי תַעֲרֹג אֵלֶיךָ אֱלֹהִים."11Metaphor: Psalm 23:1: "יְהוָה רֹעִי."15Metaphor: Psalm 84:11: "כִּי שֶׁמֶשׁ וּמָגֵן יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים."11Analytical Questions:What two things are being compared? Identify the target (the main subject) and the source (what it's being compared to).What specific characteristics of the source domain are being transferred to the target domain?How does this comparison help to understand the target (e.g., God, the psalmist's soul) in a new or deeper way?Is this a standalone figure of speech, or is it part of an extended metaphor that develops across several verses?MerismConcept Name: MerismDefinition: A figure of speech in which a totality or whole is expressed by naming two opposite, contrasting, or complementary parts.46Function in Poetry: Merism is a poetic and compact rhetorical device for expressing completeness or all-encompassing scope ("everything"). By naming the boundaries or polar extremes of a category (e.g., "day and night," "heaven and earth"), it implies everything contained within them, creating a sense of totality and amplification.46Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 139:2: "אַתָּה יָדַעְתָּ שִׁבְתִּי וְקוּמִי..."Psalm 121:6: "יוֹמָם הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ לֹא-יַכֶּכָּה וְיָרֵחַ בַּלָּיְלָה."46Psalm 121:8: "יְהוָה יִשְׁמָר-צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ..."46Analytical Questions:What are the two opposite or complementary poles mentioned in the text?What is the whole or totality that these two extremes are meant to represent?How does using a merism create a sense of all-encompassing scope for the action or attribute being described?PersonificationConcept Name: PersonificationDefinition: The attribution of human qualities, actions, emotions, or consciousness to inanimate objects, animals, or abstract concepts.11Function in Poetry: Personification enlivens the poetic world, creating a dramatic and vivid landscape where all of creation can participate in the relationship with God. It is a powerful tool for reinforcing themes of God's universal sovereignty by depicting nature as an active participant in praise or judgment.50 It can also make abstract concepts like "justice," "peace," or "steadfast love" into active agents within a poetic narrative.50Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 98:8: "נְהָרוֹת יִמְחֲאוּ-כָף, יַחַד הָרִים יְרַנֵּנוּ."50Psalm 19:1-2: "הַשָּׁמַיִם מְסַפְּרִים כְּבוֹד-אֵל... יוֹם לְיוֹם יַבִּיעַ אֹמֶר..."50Psalm 85:10: "חֶסֶד-וֶאֱמֶת נִפְגָּשׁוּ; צֶדֶק וְשָׁלוֹם נָשָׁקוּ."50Analytical Questions:What non-human entity is being given human attributes or actions?What specific human quality (e.g., speech, emotion, action) is being attributed to it?What is the poetic or theological effect of this personification? Does it make creation seem more alive, an abstract concept more active, or God's power more pervasive?V. Macro-Structures: Poetic Form and FramingThese devices organize larger blocks of text—from a few lines to an entire psalm—creating patterns that guide the reader, build emphasis, and unify the composition.Chiasmus (Chiastic Structure)Concept Name: Chiasmus (Chiastic Structure)Definition: An inverted literary structure in which a sequence of elements (words, phrases, or themes) is presented and then repeated in reverse order, creating a mirrored pattern such as A-B-B'-A' or A-B-C-B'-A'.51 The name is derived from the Greek letter Chi ($X$), which the pattern resembles when diagrammed, as lines can be drawn connecting the parallel elements.53Function in Poetry: Chiasmus is a sophisticated device used for emphasis, memorization, and to highlight the central element of the structure (the pivot or turning point), which often contains the main idea of the passage.53 By forcing the reader to process the logic of the poem both forwards and backwards, it underscores the unity of the composition and directs attention to its theological or emotional core.53Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Micro-Chiasm: Psalm 2:10: "וְעַתָּה מְלָכִים (A), הַשְׂכִּילוּ (B); // הִוָּסְרוּ (B'), שֹׁפְטֵי אָרֶץ (A')".53Macro-Chiasm: Psalm 8 is structured as a large-scale chiasm. It is framed by praise of God's name (A, v. 1 and A', v. 9), which envelops reflections on God's glory in the heavens (B, vv. 1-3) and humanity's rule on earth (B', vv. 6-8), with the central question about humanity's significance (C, vv. 4-5) at its core.53Thematic Chiasm: Psalm 106 embeds its historical narrative within a chiastic structure of key themes and repeated words, drawing attention to central motifs like Moses's intercession and the sin at Baal-Peor.55Analytical Questions:Are there repeated words, phrases, or ideas that appear in a mirrored or inverted order (A-B...B'-A')?What is the central element of the chiasm? How is it emphasized by the surrounding structure?How do the corresponding pairs (A and A', B and B') relate to each other? Does the second element resolve, expand upon, or reflect on the first?Inclusio (Envelope Structure)Concept Name: Inclusio (Envelope Structure)Definition: A literary device where a section of text is "bracketed" or "enveloped" by repeating the same or a very similar word, phrase, or theme at both the beginning and the end.56Function in Poetry: Inclusio serves to unify a poetic unit, clearly marking its beginning and end for the reader or listener.57 It highlights the central theme encapsulated within the "envelope" and encourages the interpretation of the intervening material in light of the framing statement.56 The meaning of the repeated phrase is often enriched or deepened by the content it encloses, so its final appearance carries more weight than its first.59Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 8: Begins and ends with the identical line: "יְהוָה אֲדֹנֵינוּ מָה-אַדִּיר שִׁמְךָ בְּכָל-הָאָרֶץ!" (vv. 1, 9).57Psalm 103: Begins and ends with the exhortation "בָּרְכִי נַפְשִׁי אֶת-יְהוָה" (vv. 1, 22), framing a lengthy recitation of God's benefits and merciful character.58Psalm 118: Begins and ends with the liturgical call to worship: "הוֹדוּ לַיהוָה כִּי-טוֹב כִּי לְעוֹלָם חַסְדּוֹ" (vv. 1, 29).56Analytical Questions:Does the same or a similar line, phrase, or key theme appear at both the beginning and the end of this psalm or stanza?What is the main idea of the material contained within this "envelope"?How does the repetition of the framing device guide the interpretation of the central content?Is the meaning of the closing phrase identical to the opening one, or has it been deepened by the intervening text?RefrainConcept Name: RefrainDefinition: A line, part of a line, or a group of lines repeated at regular or strategic intervals within a poem, functioning similarly to a chorus in a modern song.54Function in Poetry: A refrain serves as a primary structural marker, dividing a psalm into distinct stanzas or sections.63 Thematically, it often encapsulates the central plea, affirmation of trust, or core theme of the psalm, reinforcing it through repetition and providing an anchor point for the reader's attention and emotion.65Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalms 42-43: The refrain "מַה-תִּשְׁתּוֹחֲחִי נַפְשִׁי וַתֶּהֱמִי עָלָי הוֹחִילִי לֵאלֹהִים כִּי-עוֹד אוֹדֶנּוּ יְשׁוּעֹת פָּנַי וֵאלֹהָי" appears three times (42:5, 42:11; 43:5), structuring the poem and tracing the psalmist's internal struggle and self-exhortation.62Psalm 46: The refrain "יְהוָה צְבָאוֹת עִמָּנוּ מִשְׂגָּב-לָנוּ אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב סֶלָה" appears after the second and third stanzas (vv. 7, 11), acting as a powerful, climactic affirmation of trust.62Psalm 136: The refrain "כִּי לְעוֹלָם חַסְדּוֹ" is repeated after every single colon, making it the dominant structural and theological statement of the entire psalm.65Analytical Questions:Is there a line or phrase that repeats at key junctures in the psalm?How does this refrain divide the psalm into larger structural units (stanzas)?What is the central message of the refrain, and how does its repetition shape the psalm's overall theme and emotional trajectory?VI. Rhythm and CadenceThis section addresses the prosody of Hebrew poetry, clarifying the scholarly consensus on its distinctive rhythmic nature, which is tied more to logic and stress than to syllable counts.Meter & RhythmConcept Name: Meter & RhythmDefinition: Unlike much Western poetry that relies on a strict syllabic meter (a fixed number of syllables per line), the scholarly consensus is that biblical Hebrew poetry is based on an accentual rhythm.68 This means the rhythm is determined by the number of stressed or accented syllables per colon, with the number of unstressed syllables in between being variable.68 This rhythm is not an independent system imposed on the words; rather, it is an emergent property of the parallel structure itself. Because parallel lines often use parallel syntax (e.g., Noun-Verb-Object // Noun-Verb-Object), they naturally result in a similar number of stressed words, creating a "rhythm of thought" or syntactic rhythm.6Function in Poetry: The accentual rhythm creates a distinct cadence and pace appropriate for oral recitation and liturgy. The balance of stresses between the two cola of a line is a key component of parallelism, reinforcing the semantic relationship with a phonetic one. This gives the poetry a powerful, incantatory quality that enhances its emotional impact and aids in memorization.69Canonical Examples (from Psalms): (Note: Stress patterns are most apparent in Hebrew but can be approximated in translation by focusing on major content words.)Psalm 23:1: "יְהוָה רֹעִי // לֹא אֶחְסָר."Psalm 19:1: "הַשָּׁמַיִם מְסַפְּרִים כְּבוֹד-אֵל // וּמַעֲשֵׂה יָדָיו מַגִּיד הָרָקִיעַ."Analytical Questions:When reading the line aloud, how many major stressed words or syllables are in the first colon versus the second?Is there a sense of rhythmic balance, or does one colon feel significantly longer or heavier than the other? How does this affect the meaning?How does the rhythm contribute to the overall feeling or impact of the line (e.g., is it stately and balanced, urgent and short, or falling in a lamenting cadence)?How does the grammatical structure of each colon contribute to its rhythmic feel?
