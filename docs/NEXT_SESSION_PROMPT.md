# Next Session Prompt - Psalms Commentary Project

**Date**: 2025-10-19 (Updated after Session 8)
**Phase**: Phase 4 - Master Editor Enhancement

---

## SESSION 8 (Next Session): Enrich Methodological Summary

### Goal
Enhance the "Methodological & Bibliographical Summary" in the print-ready output by adding performance metrics and more detailed model attribution. This will provide a complete, transparent fingerprint of the generation process for each psalm.

### Plan

1.  **Add Timing Information to Summary**
    - Modify `commentary_formatter.py` to read the `pipeline_stats.json` file.
    - Extract the total pipeline duration and the duration for each agent step (Macro, Micro, Synthesis, Editor).
    - Add these timings to the "Methodological & Bibliographical Summary" section in a clean, readable format (e.g., "Total Processing Time: 19.9 minutes").

2.  **Refine "Models Used" Section**
    - The current "Models Used" section lists all models and their call counts.
    - Enhance this to specify which model was used for each agent/pass (e.g., "Macro Analysis: claude-sonnet-4-20250514").
    - This provides clearer attribution and is more useful for scholarly review. This data is available in the pipeline runner script and should be passed to the summary tracker.

### Files to Modify

- **`src/utils/commentary_formatter.py`**: To parse and display the new timing and model data.
- **`src/utils/pipeline_summary.py`**: To track model usage per agent.
- **`scripts/run_enhanced_pipeline.py`**: To pass the model names for each agent to the summary tracker.

### Expected Outcome
- The final `psalm_XXX_print_ready.md` file will contain a comprehensive summary including not only the research inputs but also the performance metrics and specific models used for each stage of analysis.

## SESSION 7 (2025-10-19 Evening): Print-Ready Formatting & Bug Fixes - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

### What Was Accomplished

This session focused on fine-tuning the output of `commentary_formatter.py` to ensure a clean copy-paste experience into Microsoft Word.

1.  **Critical Bug Fix: LTR/RTL Formatting in Word**
    - **Problem**: When pasting bilingual (Hebrew/English) lines into Word, the text would run together with no separation, and manual spacing attempts failed.
    - **Fix**: Implemented a robust solution using a Left-to-Right Mark (`\u200e`) followed by two tab characters (`\t\t`) between the Hebrew and English text. This creates a reliable visual space that Word's rendering engine respects.

2.  **Enhancement: Reduced Paragraph Spacing**
    - **Problem**: Double newlines in the markdown source created large, undesirable gaps between paragraphs in Word.
    - **Fix**: Replaced all double newlines (`\n\n`) with single newlines (`\n`) in the introduction and verse commentary sections. This creates "soft breaks" for a tighter, more professional layout.

3.  **Enhancement: Bibliographical Summary**
    - Added a "Methodological & Bibliographical Summary" section to the print-ready output, pulling data from the pipeline statistics file.

### Files Modified

- **`src/utils/commentary_formatter.py`**: All formatting changes were implemented here.
- **`scripts/run_formatter.py`**: New convenience script created.

### Evidence of Success
- ‚úÖ Regenerated `psalm_145_print_ready.md` contains the new formatting.
- ‚úÖ Pasting the content into Word now preserves visual separation and has appropriate paragraph spacing.

---

## SESSION 6 (2025-10-19 Evening): Master Editor Context & Commentary Fix - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

### What Was Accomplished

1.  **Critical Bug Fix: Master Editor Commentary Truncation**
    - **Problem**: The Master Editor was only receiving the first 200 characters of the synthesizer's verse-by-verse commentary, causing it to miss all detailed phonetic and figurative language analysis. This resulted in short, superficial edits.
    - **Fix**: Removed the `[:200]` truncation in `master_editor.py`. The editor now receives the **full, un-truncated commentary** for the first 5 verses, giving it the complete context for its review.

2.  **Critical Enhancement: Master Editor Scholarly Context**
    - **Problem**: The Master Editor was not being provided with the `analytical_framework.md` document that guides the other agents on poetic and literary principles.
    - **Fix**: The `master_editor.py` agent now loads and injects the full analytical framework into its prompt. This gives it the same deep knowledge base as the synthesizer.

3.  **Prompt Enhancement: Informed Discretion**
    - The Master Editor prompt was updated to explicitly grant it **editorial discretion** over the synthesizer's analysis.
    - It is now instructed to *evaluate*, *verify*, and *enhance* the phonetic and figurative analysis, rather than just summarizing it. This encourages deeper scholarly engagement.

### Files Modified

- **`src/agents/master_editor.py`**
  - Lines 188-194: Added new prompt instructions for scholarly grounding and discretion.
  - Lines 372-378: Added logic to load `analytical_framework.md` via `RAGManager`.
  - Lines 424-425: Passed the framework to the prompt formatter.
  - Line 626: Removed the `[:200]` truncation, passing the full commentary.

### Evidence of Success

- ‚úÖ Code changes applied to `master_editor.py`.
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated in `NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md`.
- üîÑ **Next Step**: Re-run the pipeline from the master editor step for Psalm 145 to validate the fix.

---

## Next Priorities (Post-Fix Validation)

### Immediate (Next Session):

1. **Validate Master Editor Fix for Psalm 145**
   - Re-run the pipeline for Psalm 145, skipping to the `master_editor` step.
   - Compare the new `psalm_145_edited_verses.md` with `psalm_145_synthesis_verses.md`.
   - **Expected Outcome**: The editor's commentary should be longer and clearly engage with the phonetic and figurative details provided by the synthesizer.

2. **Validate figurative language improvements across multiple psalms**
   - Run 2-3 more test psalms (recommended: Psalm 1, Psalm 29)
   - Verify consistent citation quality
   - Confirm pattern analysis appears in all outputs

3. **Optional: GPT-5 Raw Comparison**
   - Compare enhanced pipeline with GPT-5 raw baseline
   - Quantify value of figurative language database
   - Document specific examples where research adds value

### Short Term (1-2 Sessions):

4. **Production Run Decision**
   - Test 3-5 diverse psalms to validate quality across genres
   - Decide: Full 150 psalms (~$85-123) or selective 50-75 (~$28-61)
   - Consider implementing Claude batch API for 50% cost savings

5. **Optional Enhancements** (if desired):
   - Implement cross-reference footnotes linking figurative instances
   - Generate "Figurative Language Index" at end of commentary
   - Add relevance scoring for better top-3 selection

---

## Known Issues & Considerations

### Resolved This Session:
- ‚úÖ Print-ready formatter bug (verses showing "[Commentary not found]")
- ‚úÖ Figurative language underutilization (from 1.5% to expected 15-25%)

### Future Considerations:
- Psalm 145 editor output shows 20 parsed sections (missing one section note, but has verse 13b content)
- "ways" imagery still appears frequently (100+ instances) - consider adding to avoid list
- Usage breakdown only appears for >10 instances - consider lowering threshold

---

## Research Bundle Enhancements (New Format)

**Example: Verse 7 "pour forth" metaphor (34 instances)**

**OLD FORMAT:**
```markdown
### Query 2
**Filters**: Vehicle contains: bubble | Results: 34

#### Instances:
[First 10 instances...]
...and 24 more instances
```

**NEW FORMAT:**
```markdown
### Query 2
**Filters**: Vehicle contains: bubble
**Results**: 34

**Core pattern**: speech metaphor (28/34 instances, 82%)

**Top 3 Most Relevant** (by confidence):
1. ‚≠ê **Psalms 19:2** (confidence: 0.95) - Day to day pours forth speech...
2. ‚≠ê **Psalms 78:2** (confidence: 0.93) - I will pour forth riddles...
3. ‚≠ê **Psalms 94:4** (confidence: 0.91) - They pour forth insolence...

#### All Instances (34 total):

**Psalms 19:2** (metaphor) - confidence: 0.95
[Full details...]

[First 10 instances with confidence scores...]

*...and 24 more instances*

**Usage breakdown**: speech (28x), water (4x), abundance (2x)
```

**Impact:**
- Synthesis writer can quickly see: 82% speech metaphor
- Top 3 instances immediately accessible
- Usage distribution helps pattern analysis
