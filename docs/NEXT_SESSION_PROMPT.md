# Next Session Prompt - Psalms Commentary Project

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Phase**: Phase 4 - Commentary Enhancement & Experimentation

---

## SESSION 21 (2025-10-23): Master Editor Prompt Enhancement - COMPLETE ✅

### Goal
Enhance Master Editor prompt to: (1) enforce phonetic transcription formatting at the start of each verse commentary, and (2) increase verse commentary length for verses with interesting linguistic/literary features.

### Problem Statement
**Issue 1**: Current Master Editor verse commentary averages ~230 words per verse. While quality is good, more substantive analysis desired for verses with unusual Hebrew phrases, poetic devices, or interpretive questions (target: 400-500 words).

**Issue 2**: Phonetic transcriptions are provided in the PSALM TEXT section of the Master Editor prompt, but not appearing at the start of each verse commentary in the final output.

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Enhanced OUTPUT FORMAT Section** ✅
   - Added **CRITICAL** instruction to begin each verse with phonetic transcription
   - Explicit format requirement: `` `[phonetic transcription from PSALM TEXT]` ``
   - Strengthened length guidance from passive "target 300-500" to active "Aim for 400-500"
   - Added permission for brevity: "Only use 200-300 words for genuinely simple verses"

2. **Added Two CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS** ✅
   - **Phonetic Format**: MANDATORY—Begin each verse commentary with phonetic transcription in backticks
   - **Length**: Aim for 400-500 words per verse when there are interesting features to analyze

3. **Triple Reinforcement Strategy** ✅
   - Explicit formatting instruction in OUTPUT FORMAT section
   - Detailed length guidance with "Do NOT shortchange the reader" language
   - Two new CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS bullets

### Files Modified

- **`src/agents/master_editor.py`** (lines 266-291):
  - Enhanced OUTPUT FORMAT with phonetic transcription requirement
  - Strengthened length guidance with active language
  - Added two new CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Expected Impact

**For Phonetic Transcription**:
- 95%+ compliance expected (very explicit structural requirement)
- Each verse will start with authoritative phonetic transcription
- Example format:
  ```markdown
  **Verse 5**
  `hă-dhar kə-vōdh hō-dhe-khā wə-dhiv-rēy nif-lə-'ō-the-khā 'ā-siy-khāh`

  [400-500 word commentary analyzing unusual phrase...]
  ```

**For Length**:
- 70-80% compliance expected (subjective judgment by GPT-5)
- Expected increase: ~230 words → ~350-450 words for complex verses
- Better engagement with BDB lexicon, concordance patterns, figurative language parallels, Torah Temimah

### Next Session Goals

**Immediate (Session 22)**:
1. Re-run Master Editor on Psalm 145 with updated prompt
2. Validate phonetic transcription appears at start of each verse
3. Measure word count per verse (target: 350-450 for complex verses)
4. Verify quality improvement (deeper analysis, not padding)

**If length still insufficient**:
5. Add concrete 450-word example verse commentary to prompt
6. Consider changing "Aim for" to "Write at least 400 words for..."
7. Add editorial assessment check: "Did I write substantive analysis?"

## SESSION 20 (2025-10-23): Stress Marking Pipeline Integration - COMPLETE ✅

### Goal
Integrate stress-aware phonetic transcriptions (with **BOLD CAPS** marking stressed syllables) throughout the entire pipeline, from generation through to the final Word document output, and provide clear instructions to agents on how to interpret and use stress marking.

### Problem Statement
Sessions 18-19 implemented stress detection and marking in the PhoneticAnalyst, but the stressed transcriptions weren't being passed to downstream agents (SynthesisWriter, MasterEditor), and the agents had no instructions on how to interpret the stress notation. Additionally, the Word document generator couldn't render nested markdown (**BOLD** inside backticks).

### What Was Accomplished

1. **MicroAnalyst Updated to Use Stressed Transcriptions** ✅
   - Changed `_get_phonetic_transcriptions()` to use `syllable_transcription_stressed` field
   - All phonetic data now includes **BOLD CAPS** stress marking (e.g., `tə-**HIL**-lāh`)
   - Updated method docstring and log messages

2. **SynthesisWriter Prompt Enhanced** ✅
   - Added **STRESS NOTATION** explanation to phonetics section
   - Example provided: `mal-**KHŪTH**-khā` = stress on KHŪTH
   - Added **STRESS ANALYSIS** instructions: how to count stressed syllables
   - Example pattern analysis: "3+2 stress pattern with stresses on VŌDH, KHĀ, MĒ"

3. **MasterEditor Prompt Enhanced** ✅
   - Added **STRESS ANALYSIS IGNORED** to MISSED OPPORTUNITIES checklist
   - Explains stress notation and instructs editor to validate prosodic claims
   - Tells editor to count **BOLD CAPS** syllables for meter verification

4. **DocumentGenerator Updated for Nested Markdown** ✅
   - Enhanced `_add_paragraph_with_markdown()` to handle **BOLD** inside backticks
   - Enhanced `_add_paragraph_with_soft_breaks()` for verse commentary
   - Added `_add_nested_formatting()` helper method
   - Added `_add_nested_formatting_with_breaks()` helper method
   - Technical achievement: Backticks render as *italic*, **CAPS** inside render as ***bold italic***

5. **Comprehensive Testing** ✅
   - Created `test_stress_marking_integration.py` test suite
   - All 3 tests passed: PhoneticAnalyst, MicroAnalyst, DocumentGenerator
   - Verified stress marking flows correctly through entire pipeline

### Files Modified

- **`src/agents/micro_analyst.py`** (lines 660-686):
  - Updated `_get_phonetic_transcriptions()` to use stressed field

- **`src/agents/synthesis_writer.py`** (lines 208-214):
  - Added stress notation instructions to phonetics section

- **`src/agents/master_editor.py`** (lines 100-104):
  - Added stress analysis validation to editorial checklist

- **`src/utils/document_generator.py`** (lines 108-217):
  - Enhanced `_add_paragraph_with_markdown()` for nested formatting
  - Enhanced `_add_paragraph_with_soft_breaks()` for nested formatting
  - Added `_add_nested_formatting()` helper method
  - Added `_add_nested_formatting_with_breaks()` helper method

### Test Results

**All tests passed** ✅

**Test 1 - PhoneticAnalyst**:
- `תְּהִלָּה` → `tə-hil-**LĀH**` (stress on final syllable)
- `לְדָוִד` → `lə-dhā-**WIDH**` (stress on final syllable)

**Test 2 - MicroAnalyst**:
- Psalm 145:1: `tə-hil-**LĀH** lə-dhā-**WIDH** 'a-rō-mim-**KHĀ**...`
- Psalm 145:2: `bə-khol-**YŌM** 'a-vā-rə-**KHEKH**-khā...`
- Psalm 145:3: `**GĀ**-dhōl yə-hō-**WĀH** ū-mə-hul-**LĀL**...`

**Test 3 - DocumentGenerator**:
- Text `tə-**HIL**-lāh` parsed into 5 Word runs
- 2 runs bold (HIL), all 5 runs italic
- Nested formatting logic works correctly

### Expected Impact

**For Synthesis Writer (Claude Sonnet 4.5)**:
- From vague "rhythmic" → specific "3+2 stress pattern with stresses on VŌDH, KHĀ, MĒ"
- From unverifiable prosodic analysis → evidence-based meter analysis
- Can now cite specific stressed syllables in commentary

**For Master Editor (GPT-5)**:
- Can validate prosodic claims against actual stress data
- Can add missing stress analysis if synthesis writer omitted it
- Can verify stress counts by counting **BOLD CAPS** syllables

**For Word Documents**:
- Stressed syllables appear in ***bold italic*** format
- Readers can verify meter claims by counting bold syllables
- Pedagogically useful for understanding Hebrew prosody

**For Commentary Quality**:
- More accurate prosodic analysis based on cantillation marks
- Verifiable stress pattern claims
- Better alignment with Masoretic tradition

---

## SESSION 19 (2025-10-23): Maqqef Stress Domain Correction - COMPLETE ✅

### Goal
Fix maqqef compound stress handling to match Hebrew cantillation rules where maqqef creates ONE ACCENT DOMAIN and only the last word receives stress.

### Problem Statement
Session 18's implementation gave stress to BOTH components of maqqef compounds (e.g., `בְּכׇל־דְּרָכָ֑יו` → `bə-**KHOL**-də-rā-**KHĀY**-w`), but this is linguistically incorrect. In Hebrew cantillation, maqqef creates a single prosodic unit where only the final word receives the accent mark.

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Maqqef Stress Domain Correction** ✅
   - Modified `_transcribe_maqqef_compound()` to apply stress ONLY to last component
   - Changed from multi-stress model to single-stress model
   - Updated linguistic model: maqqef = one accent domain (not multiple independent words)

2. **Code Changes** ✅
   - Renamed `all_stressed_indices` → `last_component_stress_index` (singular)
   - Added enumeration to detect last component: `is_last_component = (i == len(components) - 1)`
   - Changed from `_format_syllables_with_multiple_stresses()` to `_format_syllables_with_stress()`
   - Updated docstring to reflect new cantillation-based model

3. **Comprehensive Testing** ✅
   - Tested on 4 cases from Psalm 145 (verses 2, 14, 17)
   - All tests pass: only 1 stress per compound, on last word
   - Verification: `בְּכׇל־דְּרָכָ֑יו` now → `bə-khol-də-rā-**KHĀY**-w` (correct!)

### Files Modified

- **`src/agents/phonetic_analyst.py`** (lines 287-351):
  - Updated `_transcribe_maqqef_compound()` method
  - Changed stress handling from multiple to single (last word only)
  - Updated docstring with cantillation-based explanation

### Test Results

**All 4 test cases passed** ✅

| Hebrew | Before (Session 18) | After (Session 19) | Status |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|--------|
| בְּכׇל־דְּרָכָ֑יו | bə-**KHOL**-də-rā-**KHĀY**-w | bə-khol-də-rā-**KHĀY**-w | ✅ |
| בְּכׇל־מַעֲשָֽׂיו | bə-**KHOL**-ma-ʿa-**SĀY**-w | bə-khol-ma-ʿa-**SĀY**-w | ✅ |
| לְכׇל־הַנֹּפְלִ֑ים | lə-**KHOL**-han-nō-fə-**LIY**-m | lə-khol-han-nō-fə-**LIY**-m | ✅ |
| בְּכׇל־יוֹם | bə-**KHOL**-**YŌM** | bə-khol-**YŌM** | ✅ |

### Expected Impact

**For Phonetic Accuracy**:
- Maqqef compounds now match actual Hebrew cantillation rules
- Unstressed proclitics (like כׇל) correctly show no stress
- Only accent-bearing words show stress marks

**For Commentary**:
- More accurate prosodic analysis (fewer stress marks = correct meter)
- Verse 17 stress count: was 4 stresses, now 2 stresses (correct!)
- Better alignment with Masoretic cantillation tradition

**Breaking Change**:
- Any existing phonetic transcriptions with maqqef will show different stress
- This is a CORRECTION, not a regression
- Recommendation: Re-run phonetic analysis on processed psalms if maqqef cited

### Next Session Goals

**Immediate (Session 20)**:
1. Re-run Psalm 145 phonetic analysis with corrected maqqef handling
2. Verify all maqqef compounds now show correct stress patterns
3. Check if any commentary references old (incorrect) maqqef stress patterns

**Optional**:
4. Update synthesis/editor prompts to note maqqef = unstressed proclitic
5. Add prosodic analysis that accounts for accent domains

---

## SESSION 18 (2025-10-23): Stress-Aware Phonetic Transcription - COMPLETE ✅

### Goal
Enhance the phonetic transcription system to include stress/accent marking based on cantillation marks (te'amim), enabling agents to analyze prosodic patterns, meter, and rhythm with verifiable evidence.

### Problem Statement
Commentary like "The measured rhythm of kə-vōdh mal-khūth-khā yō'-mē-rū is stately" was unhelpful because:
- No indication of which syllables are stressed
- No stress count or meter pattern shown
- Readers can't verify prosodic claims
- Not pedagogically useful for understanding Hebrew phonology

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Cantillation-Based Stress Detection** ✅
   - Added comprehensive cantillation mark mapping (30+ Hebrew accents)
   - Mapped primary disjunctive accents (Silluq, Atnah, Zaqef, Tifcha, etc.) to stress level 2
   - Mapped secondary conjunctive accents (Munach, Mahpakh, Mercha) to stress level 1
   - Excluded Dehi (֭) - it's a conjunctive accent that doesn't mark lexical stress

2. **Stress-to-Syllable Mapping** ✅
   - Enhanced `_transcribe_word()` to detect cantillation marks during transcription
   - Created `_find_syllable_for_phoneme()` to map stress position to syllable index
   - Implemented `_format_syllables_with_stress()` to render stressed syllables in **BOLD CAPS**
   - Added default ultima (final syllable) stress rule for words without cantillation marks

3. **Maqqef Compound Handling** ✅
   - Created `_transcribe_maqqef_compound()` method to handle word connectors (־)
   - Splits compounds and transcribes each component separately
   - Applies stress to BOTH components (e.g., לְכׇל־הַנֹּפְלִ֑ים → lə-**KHOL**-han-nō-fə-**LIY**-m)
   - Implemented `_format_syllables_with_multiple_stresses()` for multi-stress output

4. **Multiple Stress Mark Handling** ✅
   - When multiple cantillation marks present, prefer rightmost (actual stress position)
   - Example: וּ֝מֶֽמְשַׁלְתְּךָ֗ has 3 marks → stress on final syllable where Revia (֗) is

5. **Enhanced Output Format** ✅
   - New field: `syllable_transcription_stressed` with **BOLD CAPS** for stressed syllables
   - New field: `stressed_syllable_index` (0-based syllable position)
   - New field: `stress_level` (0=unstressed, 1=secondary, 2=primary)
   - Backward compatible - existing `syllable_transcription` field preserved

### Files Modified

- **`src/agents/phonetic_analyst.py`**: All stress detection enhancements
  - Added `cantillation_stress` dictionary (lines 43-74)
  - Enhanced `_transcribe_word()` with stress detection (lines 127-149)
  - Added default ultima stress rule (lines 261-265)
  - Created `_transcribe_maqqef_compound()` method (lines 287-343)
  - Created `_find_syllable_for_phoneme()` helper (lines 536-553)
  - Created `_format_syllables_with_stress()` method (lines 555-573)
  - Created `_format_syllables_with_multiple_stresses()` method (lines 575-597)

### Test Results

All stress patterns validated on Psalm 145:7-17:

**Before Enhancement**:
```
Verse 11: kə-vōdh mal-khūth-khā yō'-mē-rū
Problem: Which syllables are stressed? What's the meter?
```

**After Enhancement**:
```
Verse 11: kə-**VŌDH** mal-khūth-**KHĀ** yō'-**MĒ**-rū ū-ghə-vū-rā-thə-**KHĀ** yə-dha-**BĒ**-rū
Pattern: 3+2 stresses (VŌDH | KHĀ | MĒ // KHĀ | BĒ)
Result: Verifiable, specific, pedagogically clear
```

**Maqqef Compounds**:
```
Before: lə-khol-han-nō-fə-LIY-m (only 1 stress)
After:  lə-**KHOL**-han-nō-fə-**LIY**-m (2 stresses - correct!)
```

**Verses Tested**: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17
- ✅ All stress patterns match expected Hebrew phonology
- ✅ Maqqef compounds show multiple stresses correctly
- ✅ Default ultima stress applies when no cantillation present
- ✅ Stress counts accurate (2-7 stresses per verse)

### Cantillation Mark Reference

**Primary Stress (Level 2)** - Major disjunctive accents:
- Silluq/Meteg (ֽ◌) - verse end
- Atnah (֑◌) - major division
- Zaqef Qaton (֔◌), Zaqef Gadol (֕◌)
- Tifcha (֖◌), R'vi'i (֗◌), Zarqa (֘◌)
- Pashta (֙◌), Yetiv (֚◌), Tevir (֛◌)
- Geresh (֜◌), Gershayim (֞◌)

**Secondary Stress (Level 1)** - Conjunctive accents:
- Munach (֣◌), Mahpakh (֤◌), Mercha (֥◌)
- Qadma (֨◌), Ole (֫◌), Pazer (֡◌)

**Not Included**:
- Dehi (֭◌) - conjunctive accent, doesn't mark lexical stress

### Expected Impact

**For Commentary**:
- From vague: "the rhythm is stately"
- To specific: "3+2 stress pattern with stresses on VŌDH | KHĀ | MĒ creates measured proclamation"

**For Agents**:
- Synthesis Writer can count stresses and show patterns explicitly
- Master Editor can verify prosodic claims against actual stress data
- Both agents can cite specific stressed syllables (e.g., "stress on VŌDH")

**For Readers**:
- Can count **BOLD CAPS** syllables to verify stress counts
- Can see meter patterns (e.g., "3+3 balanced" vs "3+2 asymmetric")
- Pedagogically useful for understanding Hebrew phonology

### Known Limitations

1. **Schwa Syllabification**: Word-final sequences like תְּךָ render as `TKHĀ` (single syllable) rather than `tə-KHĀ` (two syllables). This is phonetically accurate for rapid speech but could be pedagogically clearer. Decision: Keep current (phonetically accurate).

2. **Secondary vs. Primary**: Some secondary accents (conjunctives) may not always indicate lexical stress. Current implementation treats all conjunctives as secondary stress, which is generally correct but not universally so.

### Next Session Goals

**Immediate (Session 19)**:
1. Update `SynthesisWriter` prompts to use stressed transcriptions
   - Modify `format_phonetic_section()` to use `stressed_transcription` field
   - Add instructions on HOW to cite stress patterns
   - Require explicit stress counts and syllable naming

2. Update `MasterEditor` prompts to validate stress claims
   - Add validation checklist for prosodic analysis
   - Require verification that stress counts match phonetic data
   - Flag vague claims like "rhythmic" without evidence

3. Test on Psalm 145 full pipeline
   - Regenerate with stress-aware prompts
   - Verify commentary shows specific stress patterns
   - Validate meter analysis is evidence-based

**Files to Modify Next Session**:
- `src/agents/synthesis_writer.py` (prompts + format helper)
- `src/agents/master_editor.py` (validation criteria)
- Test on Psalm 145 to validate quality improvement

### Documentation Created

- `output/stress_test_verses_7-13.md` - Sample output with analysis
- `test_stress_extraction.py` - Proof-of-concept demonstration
- `test_stress_multi_verse.py` - Multi-verse validation
- `test_stress_output.py` - Full stress-aware transcription test

### Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible**
- Existing `syllable_transcription` field preserved
- New `stressed_transcription` field added alongside
- Old pipelines continue to work
- New pipelines automatically use stress marking when available

## SESSION 17 (2025-10-23): Phonetic Engine Bug Fixes - COMPLETE ✅

### Goal
Fix three critical bugs in the phonetic transcription engine discovered during testing: (1) qamets qatan not recognized, (2) dagesh incorrectly mapped as vowel, (3) incorrect syllabification with shewa + consonant clusters. Also add support for ketiv-qere notation.

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Bug Fix: Qamets Qatan Recognition** ✅
   - Added missing qamets qatan character (ׇ U+05C7) to vowel map
   - Correctly transcribes as short 'o' instead of long 'ā'
   - Example: בְּכׇל now produces `bə-khol` (not `bə-khāl`)

2. **Bug Fix: Dagesh Vowel Map Error** ✅
   - Removed dagesh (U+05BC ּ) from vowel map (it's not a vowel!)
   - Eliminated spurious 'u' phonemes
   - Example: חַנּוּן now produces `khannūn` (not `khannuūn`)
   - Qubuts (ֻ) was already correctly mapped

3. **Bug Fix: Syllabification with Shewa** ✅
   - Enhanced syllabification algorithm for vocal shewa + consonant clusters
   - Correctly closes syllable with shewa before starting new syllable
   - Example: בְּכׇל־יוֹם now produces `bə-khol-yōm` (not `bəkh-lyōm`)

4. **Enhancement: Ketiv-Qere Support** ✅
   - Added regex-based handling for ketiv-qere notation
   - Removes parenthetical ketiv (what is written)
   - Unwraps bracketed qere (what is read)
   - Example: `(וגדלותיך) [וּגְדֻלָּתְךָ֥]` → only qere transcribed

5. **Comprehensive Testing** ✅
   - Tested all fixes on Psalm 145 verses 1-11
   - All patterns validated: qamets qatan, gemination, matres lectionis, ketiv-qere
   - Created test scripts for regression testing

### Files Modified

- **`src/agents/phonetic_analyst.py`**: All three bug fixes and ketiv-qere support
  - Added qamets qatan to vowel map (line 37)
  - Removed dagesh from vowel map (line 26)
  - Enhanced syllabification logic (lines 320-331)
  - Added ketiv-qere preprocessing (lines 59-65)

### Test Results

All fixes validated successfully:
- ✅ Qamets qatan: בְּכׇל → `bə-khol`
- ✅ Dagesh fix: חַנּוּן → `khannūn`
- ✅ Syllabification: בְּכׇל־יוֹם → `bə-khol-yōm`
- ✅ Ketiv-qere: Only bracketed qere transcribed
- ✅ Gemination: תְּהִלָּה → `tə-hil-lāh`
- ✅ Matres lectionis: יוֹם → `yōm`

### Expected Impact

- **Higher Accuracy**: Phonetic transcriptions now handle edge cases correctly
- **Better Syllabification**: Vocal shewa patterns syllabify according to Hebrew phonology
- **Traditional Compliance**: Ketiv-qere notation handled according to reading tradition
- **Production Ready**: Engine validated on real psalm text with complex features

---

## SESSION 16 (2025-10-23): Phonetic Transcription Relocation - COMPLETE ✅

### Goal
Reorganize the Master Editor prompt to show phonetic transcriptions alongside verses in the PSALM TEXT section (at the top of the prompt), rather than in the MICRO DISCOVERIES section. This improves accessibility and makes it easier for the Master Editor to reference phonetics when analyzing verses.

### What Was Accomplished

1.  **Fixed Critical Indentation Bug** ✅
    - The `_get_psalm_text` method was incorrectly nested inside `_parse_editorial_response` method (line 532)
    - Unindented the method to the class level, fixing the duplicate method definition error
    - Method now properly compiles and can be called

2.  **Enhanced `_get_psalm_text` Method** ✅
    - Added `micro_analysis` parameter to extract phonetic data
    - Method now retrieves phonetic transcriptions from micro analysis JSON
    - Includes phonetics in formatted output alongside Hebrew, English, and LXX text
    - Format: `**Phonetic**: \`syllabified-transcription\``

3.  **Removed Phonetics from MICRO DISCOVERIES** ✅
    - Modified `_format_analysis_for_prompt` method (lines 656-666)
    - Removed code that was outputting phonetic transcriptions in micro section
    - Commentary text now displays without phonetics (cleaner, less redundant)

4.  **Reorganized Prompt Structure** ✅
    - Moved `### PSALM TEXT` section to top of prompt (line 66)
    - Updated section header to include "and Phonetic"
    - **New prompt order:**
      1. PSALM TEXT (with phonetics) ← **moved to top**
      2. INTRODUCTION ESSAY
      3. VERSE COMMENTARY
      4. FULL RESEARCH BUNDLE
      5. MACRO THESIS
      6. MICRO DISCOVERIES (without phonetics)

5.  **Updated Prompt References** ✅
    - Changed references from "see above in ### MICRO DISCOVERIES" to "see above in ### PSALM TEXT" (lines 101-102)
    - Ensures Master Editor knows where to find authoritative phonetic data
    - Instructions now correctly point to the PSALM TEXT section

6.  **Testing & Validation** ✅
    - Tested `_get_psalm_text` method with sample micro analysis data
    - Confirmed phonetics are extracted and included in output
    - Verified prompt structure places PSALM TEXT before MACRO THESIS

### Files Modified

-   **`src/agents/master_editor.py`**: All changes implemented in this file
    - Fixed `_get_psalm_text` indentation (line 532)
    - Enhanced `_get_psalm_text` to include phonetics from micro analysis
    - Updated `_format_analysis_for_prompt` to exclude phonetics
    - Moved PSALM TEXT section in prompt template
    - Updated prompt references to phonetic location

### Expected Impact

-   **Better Accessibility**: Phonetics now appear at the top with verse text, making them immediately visible
-   **Reduced Redundancy**: Phonetics no longer duplicated across multiple prompt sections
-   **Clearer Context**: Master Editor can see Hebrew, phonetic, English, and LXX together for each verse
-   **Improved Analysis**: Easier to reference phonetics when analyzing specific verses
-   **Fixed Bug**: Duplicate method definition error resolved

### Example Output

**Before** (MICRO DISCOVERIES):
```
**Verse 1**
**Phonetic**: `tə-hil-lāh lə-dhā-widh...`
Opens with 'תְּהִלָּה' (song of praise)...
```

**After** (PSALM TEXT):
```
## Verse 1
**Hebrew:** תְּהִלָּ֗ה לְדָ֫וִ֥ד אֲרוֹמִמְךָ֣...
**Phonetic**: `tə-hil-lāh lə-dhā-widh 'a-rō-mim-khā...`
**English:** A song of praise. Of David. I will extol You...
**LXX (Greek):** αἴνεσις ὁ δαυίδ ὑψόω σύ...
```

## SESSION 15 (2025-10-23): Phonetic Transcription Data Flow Fix - COMPLETE ✅

### Goal
Fix a critical bug where the phonetic transcriptions, including syllabification, were not being passed to the `SynthesisWriter` and `MasterEditor` agents.

### What Was Accomplished

1.  **Bug Fix Implemented** ✅
    - Modified `src/agents/synthesis_writer.py` to correctly include the phonetic transcriptions in the prompt for the `VerseCommentary` generation.
    - Added the `{phonetic_section}` placeholder to the `VERSE_COMMENTARY_PROMPT`.
    - Called the `format_phonetic_section` function in the `_generate_verse_commentary` method and passed the result to the prompt.

2.  **Validation** ✅
    - Verified that the `master_editor_prompt_psalm_145.txt` file now contains the syllabified phonetic transcriptions.

### Files Modified

-   **`src/agents/synthesis_writer.py`**: Implemented the fix for the phonetic data flow.
-   **`docs/NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md`**: Added this summary.
-   **`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`**: Added entry for Session 15.

### Expected Impact

-   **Higher Quality Commentary**: The `SynthesisWriter` and `MasterEditor` agents will now have access to the authoritative phonetic transcriptions, leading to more accurate and insightful analysis of phonetic features in the psalms.

---

## SESSION 14 (2025-10-23): Prioritized Figuration Truncation - COMPLETE ✅

### Goal
Enhance the research bundle truncation logic to preserve the most relevant figurative language examples. When the research bundle exceeds the model's context window, the previous strategy trimmed all sections proportionally, risking the loss of valuable examples from the Book of Psalms.

### What Was Accomplished

1.  **Intelligent Truncation Implemented** ✅
    - Modified the `SynthesisWriter` agent to adopt a smarter trimming strategy for the figurative language section.
    - The new logic categorizes figurative instances into "Psalms" and "other books."
    - It now prioritizes keeping instances from Psalms, only discarding them after all examples from other books have been removed.

2.  **Code Refactoring** ✅
    - The `_trim_figurative_proportionally` function in `src/agents/synthesis_writer.py` was rewritten and renamed to `_trim_figurative_with_priority` to reflect its new, more intelligent behavior.
    - The call site within the `_trim_research_bundle` function was updated accordingly.

3.  **Comprehensive Documentation** ✅
    - Created a new detailed summary document: `docs/PRIORITIZED_TRUNCATION_SUMMARY.md`.
    - Updated `docs/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md` to describe the new prioritized truncation in the "Context Length Management" section.
    - Updated `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md` with a detailed entry for this session.
    - Updated this file (`NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md`) with the summary of this session.

### Files Modified

-   **`src/agents/synthesis_writer.py`**: Implemented the core logic for prioritized truncation.
-   **`docs/PRIORITIZED_TRUNCATION_SUMMARY.md`**: New detailed documentation for the feature.
-   **`docs/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md`**: Updated to reflect the new truncation strategy.
-   **`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`**: Added entry for Session 14.
-   **`docs/NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md`**: Added this summary.

### Key Design Decision

-   **Modify in Place**: The decision was made to refactor the existing truncation function rather than adding a new one. This enhances the current logic without adding unnecessary complexity, keeping the code DRY and localized to the agent responsible for the behavior.

### Expected Impact

-   **Higher Quality Commentary**: The Synthesis and Editor agents will receive more relevant context, leading to more insightful analysis of figurative language within the Psalms.
-   **Improved Robustness**: The pipeline is now more robust to large research bundles, intelligently preserving the most critical information.

# Next Session Prompt - Psalms Commentary Project

**Date**: 2025-10-22
**Phase**: Phase 4 - Commentary Enhancement & Experimentation

---

## SESSION 13 (2025-10-22): Commentary Modes Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

### Goal
Implement dual commentary modes:
1. **Default Mode**: ALWAYS provide ALL 7 commentaries for ALL verses in research bundle
2. **Selective Mode**: ONLY provide commentaries for verses micro analyst specifically requests (via --skip-default-commentaries flag)

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Commentary Mode Architecture** ✅
   - Added `commentary_mode` parameter to MicroAnalystV2 (defaults to "all")
   - Created two instruction templates:
     - `COMMENTARY_ALL_VERSES`: Comprehensive approach for every verse
     - `COMMENTARY_SELECTIVE`: Targeted approach for 3-8 puzzling verses
   - Modified `_generate_research_requests()` to inject appropriate template
   - Added validation to ensure only "all" or "selective" modes accepted

2. **Pipeline Integration** ✅
   - Added `--skip-default-commentaries` flag to run_enhanced_pipeline.py
   - Maps flag to `commentary_mode` parameter: flag present → "selective", absent → "all"
   - Updated both MicroAnalystV2 instantiations (intro and verses)
   - Added logging to indicate which mode is active

3. **Comprehensive Testing** ✅
   - Created test_commentary_modes.py with 4 test cases
   - All tests passed:
     * Instantiation with both modes ✓
     * Validation of invalid modes ✓
     * Template content verification ✓
     * Prompt formatting with both templates ✓
   - Fixed Unicode encoding issue on Windows (UTF-8 reconfiguration)

4. **Documentation** ✅
   - Created COMMENTARY_MODES_IMPLEMENTATION.md with:
     * Usage examples for both modes
     * Implementation details
     * Rationale for design decisions
     * Testing instructions
     * Backward compatibility notes
   - Updated IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md with Session 13 entry
   - Updated NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md (this file)

### Files Modified

**Core Implementation**:
- **`src/agents/micro_analyst.py`** (lines ~170-210):
  - Added `commentary_mode` parameter to `__init__()`
  - Created COMMENTARY_ALL_VERSES template
  - Created COMMENTARY_SELECTIVE template
  - Modified `_generate_research_requests()` to use appropriate template

- **`scripts/run_enhanced_pipeline.py`** (lines ~80-90, ~380-390):
  - Added `skip_default_commentaries` parameter to function
  - Added `--skip-default-commentaries` command-line argument
  - Updated MicroAnalystV2 instantiations to pass commentary_mode
  - Added logging for active mode

**Documentation & Testing**:
- **`COMMENTARY_MODES_IMPLEMENTATION.md`**: New comprehensive documentation
- **`test_commentary_modes.py`**: New test suite (4 tests, all passing)
- **`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`**: Added Session 13 entry
- **`docs/NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md`**: Added Session 13 summary

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Default to "all" mode**: Maintains Session 12 behavior (backward compatibility)
2. **Two modes only**: Covers 95% of use cases without unnecessary complexity
3. **Template-based instructions**: Cleaner than conditional prompt logic
4. **Flag naming**: `--skip-default-commentaries` clearly describes effect
5. **Parameter location**: commentary_mode set at agent initialization (not per-method)

### Test Results

**Test Suite** (all passing):
```
TEST 1: MicroAnalystV2 instantiation ................ ✓ PASS
TEST 2: Mode validation .............................. ✓ PASS
TEST 3: Template content verification ................ ✓ PASS
TEST 4: Prompt formatting ............................ ✓ PASS

🎉 ALL TESTS PASSED
```

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Default mode (all commentaries for all verses)
python scripts/run_enhanced_pipeline.py 1

# Selective mode (only request commentaries for specific verses)
python scripts/run_enhanced_pipeline.py 1 --skip-default-commentaries

# Compare outputs
python scripts/run_enhanced_pipeline.py 1 --output-dir output/psalm_1_all
python scripts/run_enhanced_pipeline.py 1 --output-dir output/psalm_1_selective --skip-default-commentaries
```

### Expected Impact

**Default Mode ("all")**:
- Research bundle: ~10-14% larger
- Token cost: +5-8% per psalm
- Quality: Maximum traditional scholarly grounding
- Use case: Publication-quality commentary

**Selective Mode ("selective")**:
- Research bundle: Smaller (only 3-8 verses)
- Token cost: Baseline
- Quality: Targeted traditional insights
- Use case: Draft/experimental work, cost optimization

### Backward Compatibility

✅ All existing scripts continue to work without modification
✅ Default behavior matches Session 12 (comprehensive commentary)
✅ New flag is opt-in (must explicitly enable selective mode)

---

## SESSION 12 (2025-10-22): Torah Temimah Integration & Commentary Experiment - COMPLETE ✅

### Goal
1. Integrate Torah Temimah as the 7th traditional commentary source
2. Modify pipeline to include ALL 7 commentaries by default (not selective)
3. Run experiment comparing 6-commentary vs 7-commentary outputs

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Torah Temimah Integration** ✅
   - Added `"Torah Temimah": "Torah Temimah on Psalms"` to COMMENTATORS dictionary
   - Updated documentation (SCHOLARLY_EDITOR_SUMMARY.md, TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md)
   - Created comprehensive integration test suite - all 5 tests passed
   - Validated Torah Temimah fetches correctly from Sefaria API

2. **Translation Agent Decision** ✅
   - Analyzed Torah Temimah content: Rabbinic Hebrew + Aramaic (Talmudic citations)
   - **Decision**: NO translation agent needed
   - **Rationale**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5 handle Talmudic Hebrew natively
   - Torah Temimah structure is explicit (clear verse-to-Talmud connections)
   - Existing 6 commentaries with English provide context scaffolding

3. **Commentary Coverage Experiment** ✅
   - Modified MicroAnalystV2 to request ALL commentaries for ALL verses (not selective 2-5)
   - **Before**: Selective commentary requests (2-5 key verses per psalm)
   - **After**: Comprehensive commentary coverage (all 7 commentators for all verses)
   - **Rationale**: Commentaries represent ~10-14% of research bundle, small token cost for comprehensive coverage

4. **Documentation** ✅
   - Updated IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md with full session details
   - Created TORAH_TEMIMAH_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md (comprehensive technical doc)
   - Updated NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md (this file)

### Files Modified

- **`src/agents/commentary_librarian.py`** (line 60): Added Torah Temimah entry
- **`src/agents/micro_analyst.py`** (lines ~180-210): Modified `_generate_commentary_requests()` to request all verses
- **`docs/SCHOLARLY_EDITOR_SUMMARY.md`** (line 43): Added Torah Temimah to list
- **`docs/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md`** (line 130): Updated commentator count to 7
- **`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`**: Added Session 12 entry (2025-10-22)

### Test Results

**Integration Test**: 5/5 passed ✅
- Torah Temimah registered correctly
- Successfully fetched for Psalm 1:1, 1:2
- All 7 commentators fetch together
- Markdown formatting works correctly

**Torah Temimah Sample** (Psalm 1:1):
```
Hebrew length: 1,085 characters
Content: Talmudic citations (Avodah Zarah 18b, Berakhot 9b, Kiddushin 40b, Avot 3)
Structure: Verse quote → "תנו רבנן" (Our Rabbis taught) → Talmudic passage → Source attribution
```

### Experiment Details

**Hypothesis**: Including all 7 commentaries for all verses will:
- Increase research bundle size by ~10-14%
- Provide richer traditional perspective
- Improve Synthesis Writer's ability to cite classical sources
- Enhance Master Editor's validation of interpretations

**Test Plan**:
1. Run Psalm 1 with new 7-commentary-for-all-verses configuration
2. Compare to baseline (6 commentators, selective verses)
3. Metrics to compare:
   - Research bundle character count (before: ~X, after: ~Y)
   - Number of commentary citations in introduction
   - Number of commentary citations in verse commentary
   - Master Editor's engagement with traditional sources
   - Token cost increase percentage

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Research bundle: +10-14% size increase
- Token cost: +5-8% total pipeline cost
- Quality: More comprehensive traditional grounding
- Citations: More frequent reference to classical commentators

## SESSION 11 (2025-10-21): Phonetic Analyst Bug Fix - Mater Lectionis

### Goal
**CRITICAL BUG FIX**: The `PhoneticAnalyst` was incorrectly transcribing the Hebrew letter `ו` (vav) as a consonant 'w' in all cases, failing to recognize its function as a vowel marker (*mater lectionis*) for `ō` and `ū`.

### What Was Accomplished
1.  **Root Cause Identified**: The transcription logic in `src/agents/phonetic_analyst.py` did not check for vowel diacritics (holam and shureq) associated with `ו`.
2.  **Fix Implemented**:
    *   Updated the `_transcribe_word` method in `src/agents/phonetic_analyst.py` to check for `וֹ` (holam) and `וּ` (shureq) before treating `ו` as a consonant.
3.  **Validated**:
    *   The phonetic transcriptions for words containing `ו` as a vowel are now correct.
    *   `יִתְיַצְּבוּ` is now correctly transcribed as `yithyatsvū` (not `yithyatsvwu`).
    *   `נוֹסְדוּ` is now correctly transcribed as `nōsədhū` (not `nwōsədhwu`).
    *   `מְשִׁיחוֹ` is now correctly transcribed as `məshiykhō` (not `məshiykhwō`).
    *   Consonantal `ו` (e.g., `וְרוֹזְנִים` → `wərōzəniym`) is still transcribed correctly.

### Files Modified
- `src/agents/phonetic_analyst.py`
- `docs/PHONETIC_ENHANCEMENT_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/PHONETIC_IMPLEMENTATION_EXAMPLE.md`

---

## SESSION 10 (2025-10-20): "Date Produced" Timestamp Fix - COMPLETE ✅

### Goal
**CRITICAL BUG FIX**: The "Date Produced" field in the final `.docx` and markdown outputs was showing "no date available" or an incorrect date. The timestamp was being recorded at the end of the entire pipeline run, not when the Master Editor finished its work.

### What Was Accomplished
1.  **Root Cause Identified**: The `PipelineSummaryTracker.mark_pipeline_complete()` method was only setting `pipeline_end` but not `steps['master_editor'].completion_date`, which is what the formatters look for.
2.  **Fix Implemented**:
    *   Updated `mark_pipeline_complete()` in `src/utils/pipeline_summary.py` to also set `steps["master_editor"].completion_date = self.pipeline_end.isoformat()`.
    *   Enhanced date formatting in both `commentary_formatter.py` and `document_generator.py` to display dates in "January 1, 2015" format without time or bold styling.
3.  **Validated**: The "Date Produced" now correctly reflects the time when the Master Editor step finishes and displays in a clean, readable format.

### Files Modified
- `src/utils/pipeline_summary.py`
- `src/utils/commentary_formatter.py`
- `src/utils/document_generator.py`

---

## SESSION 9 (2025-10-20): Word Document Generation & Refinement - COMPLETE ✅

### What Was Accomplished

This session focused on adding a new, robust output format to the pipeline to solve copy-paste formatting issues.

1.  **New Feature: `.docx` Generator**
    - **Problem**: Copying the print-ready Markdown into Word resulted in lost formatting, especially for bilingual text.
    - **Solution**: Created a new script, `src/utils/document_generator.py`, using the `python-docx` library. This script programmatically builds a Word document, ensuring perfect preservation of styles, fonts, and bidirectional text layout.

2.  **Pipeline Integration**
    - The new document generator was integrated as the final step in `run_enhanced_pipeline.py`.
    - A `--skip-word-doc` flag was added to control this new step.

3.  **Advanced Formatting Implemented**
    - **Bilingual Text**: Replaced tab-based layout with a two-column table for perfect Hebrew/English alignment.
    - **Typography**: Set body text to 'Aptos' and English psalm text to 'Cambria'.
    - **Layout**: Added page numbers to the footer and implemented soft breaks for verse commentary paragraphs.
    - **Markup Handling**: Correctly parses backticks (`` `...` ``) for italicized phonetic transcriptions.

4.  **Summary Section Polished & Debugged**
    - **"Date Produced" Added**: The `master_editor.py` now records a completion timestamp, which is displayed in both markdown and `.docx` outputs.
    - **Formatting Fixed**: Iteratively debugged the summary section to ensure correct ordering, bolded labels without asterisks, and proper headings for all sections.

5.  **Critical Bug Fix: Statistics Preservation**
    - Fixed an issue where partial pipeline runs would overwrite the `pipeline_stats.json` file. The tracker is now "resume-aware," preserving data integrity across runs.

### Files Modified
- `src/utils/document_generator.py`: New file created for Word document generation.
- `scripts/run_enhanced_pipeline.py`: Integrated the new generator and the statistics-resume logic.
- `src/utils/pipeline_summary.py`: Updated to support loading initial data for resuming runs.

# Next Session Prompt - Psalms Commentary Project

**Date**: 2025-10-19 (Updated after Session 7.6)
**Phase**: Phase 4 - Master Editor Enhancement

---

## SESSION 8 (2025-10-20): Formatter Data Schema Fix - COMPLETE ✅

### Goal
**CRITICAL BUG FIX**: The formatters (`commentary_formatter.py`, `document_generator.py`) were failing to parse the `model_usage` section of `pipeline_stats.json`, resulting in "Model attribution data not available."

### What Was Accomplished
1.  **Root Cause Identified**: The `pipeline_stats.json` file was correctly saving model usage in a flat dictionary (e.g., `{"macro_analysis": "model_name"}`), but the formatters were expecting an old, nested structure.
2.  **Fix Implemented**: Updated both `commentary_formatter.py` and `document_generator.py` to parse the new, simpler data schema.
3.  **Validated**: Confirmed that the "Models Used" section now correctly displays the specific model for each of the four main agents in both the print-ready markdown and the `.docx` file.

### Files Modified
- `src/utils/commentary_formatter.py`
- `src/utils/document_generator.py`

---
## SESSION 9 (Next Session): Enrich Methodological Summary

### Goal
Enhance the "Methodological & Bibliographical Summary" in the print-ready output by adding performance metrics and more detailed model attribution. This will provide a complete, transparent fingerprint of the generation process for each psalm.

### Plan

1.  **Add Timing Information to Summary**
    - Modify `commentary_formatter.py` to read the `pipeline_stats.json` file.
    - Extract the total pipeline duration and the duration for each agent step (Macro, Micro, Synthesis, Editor).
    - Add these timings to the "Methodological & Bibliographical Summary" section in a clean, readable format (e.g., "Total Processing Time: 19.9 minutes").

### Files to Modify

- **`src/utils/commentary_formatter.py`**: To parse and display the new timing and model data.
- **`src/utils/document_generator.py`**: To add the same information to the Word document for consistency.

### Expected Outcome
- The final `psalm_XXX_print_ready.md` file will contain a comprehensive summary including not only the research inputs but also the performance metrics and specific models used for each stage of analysis.

---

## SESSION 7.6 (2025-10-19 Evening): Formatter Data-Link Bug Fix - PARTIALLY COMPLETE

### What Was Accomplished

This was a debugging session to fix the "Methodological & Bibliographical Summary" section.

1.  **Critical Bug Fix: Summary Data Desynchronization - Numerical Data**
    - **Problem**: After a full pipeline run, the print-ready summary showed "N/A" or "0" for all fields.
    - **Root Cause**: The `commentary_formatter.py` script was using outdated keys to parse the `pipeline_stats.json` file.
    - **Fix**: Updated `commentary_formatter.py` to use the correct keys and data paths for all numerical statistics (Verse Count, Lexicon Entries, Concordance, etc.).

### Files Modified

- **`src/utils/commentary_formatter.py`**: All fixes were applied here to align the script with the current `pipeline_stats.json` schema.

### Evidence of Success
- ✅ All numerical fields (Verse Count, Lexicon Entries, Concordance, etc.) now display the correct values.
- ❌ **Remaining Issue**: The "Models Used" section still shows "Model attribution data not available." This indicates a continued schema mismatch for that specific data.

---

## SESSION 7 (2025-10-19 Evening): Print-Ready Formatting & Bug Fixes - COMPLETE ✅

### What Was Accomplished

This session focused on fine-tuning the output of `commentary_formatter.py` to ensure a clean copy-paste experience into Microsoft Word.

1.  **Critical Bug Fix: LTR/RTL Formatting in Word**
    - **Problem**: When pasting bilingual (Hebrew/English) lines into Word, the text would run together with no separation, and manual spacing attempts failed.
    - **Fix**: Implemented a robust solution using a Left-to-Right Mark (`\u200e`) followed by two tab characters (`\t\t`) between the Hebrew and English text. This creates a reliable visual space that Word\'s rendering engine respects.

2.  **Enhancement: Reduced Paragraph Spacing**
    - **Problem**: Double newlines in the markdown source created large, undesirable gaps between paragraphs in Word.
    - **Fix**: Replaced all double newlines (`\n\n`) with single newlines (`\n`) in the introduction and verse commentary sections. This creates "soft breaks" for a tighter, more professional layout.

3.  **Enhancement: Bibliographical Summary**
    - Added a "Methodological & Bibliographical Summary" section to the print-ready output, pulling data from the pipeline statistics file.

### Files Modified

- **`src/utils/commentary_formatter.py`**: All formatting changes were implemented here.
- **`scripts/run_formatter.py`**: New convenience script created.

### Evidence of Success
- ✅ Regenerated `psalm_145_print_ready.md` contains the new formatting.
- ✅ Pasting the content into Word now preserves visual separation and has appropriate paragraph spacing.

---

## SESSION 6 (2025-10-19 Evening): Master Editor Context & Commentary Fix - COMPLETE ✅

### What Was Accomplished

1.  **Critical Bug Fix: Master Editor Commentary Truncation**
    - **Problem**: The Master Editor was only receiving the first 200 characters of the synthesizer\'s verse-by-verse commentary, causing it to miss all detailed phonetic and figurative language analysis. This resulted in short, superficial edits.
    - **Fix**: Removed the `[:200]` truncation in `master_editor.py`. The editor now receives the **full, un-truncated commentary** for the first 5 verses, giving it the complete context for its review.

2.  **Critical Enhancement: Master Editor Scholarly Context**
    - **Problem**: The Master Editor was not being provided with the `analytical_framework.md` document that guides the other agents on poetic and literary principles.
    - **Fix**: The `master_editor.py` agent now loads and injects the full analytical framework into its prompt. This gives it the same deep knowledge base as the synthesizer.

3.  **Prompt Enhancement: Informed Discretion**
    - The Master Editor prompt was updated to explicitly grant it **editorial discretion** over the synthesizer\'s analysis.
    - It is now instructed to *evaluate*, *verify*, and *enhance* the phonetic and figurative analysis, rather than just summarizing it. This encourages deeper scholarly engagement.

### Files Modified

- **`src/agents/master_editor.py`**
  - Lines 188-194: Added new prompt instructions for scholarly grounding and discretion.
  - Lines 372-378: Added logic to load `analytical_framework.md` via `RAGManager`.
  - Lines 424-425: Passed the framework to the prompt formatter.
  - Line 626: Removed the `[:200]` truncation, passing the full commentary.

### Evidence of Success

- ✅ Code changes applied to `master_editor.py`.
- ✅ Documentation updated in `NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md`.
- 🔄 **Next Step**: Re-run the pipeline from the master editor step for Psalm 145 to validate the fix.

---
## SESSION 5 (2025-10-19 Evening): Pydantic Object Handling & Phonetic Data Flow - COMPLETE ✅

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Critical Bug Fix: Pydantic Object Handling in SynthesisWriter**
   - Fixed `AttributeError: 'MacroAnalysis' object has no attribute 'get'
   - Created universal `get_value()` helper function for Pydantic/dict compatibility
   - Applied fix to both `_format_macro_for_prompt()` and `_format_micro_for_prompt()` methods
   - Maintained full backwards compatibility with dictionary format

2. **Critical Enhancement: Phonetic Data Extraction in SynthesisWriter**
   - synthesis_writer.py now properly extracts `phonetic_transcription` from `verse_commentaries`
   - Phonetic data flows from MicroAnalyst → SynthesisWriter → Claude prompts
   - All verse commentary prompts now include phonetic transcriptions
   - Format: `**Phonetic**: 	 əhilāh lədhāwidh \'arwōmimkhā...`

3. **Master Editor Phonetic Fix**
   - Applied same Pydantic object handling fix to master_editor.py
   - Master Editor now receives phonetic data for first 5 verses
   - GPT-5 can verify sound-pattern claims against authoritative transcriptions
   - Enables editorial review of alliteration, assonance, and phonetic analysis

### Files Modified

- **`src/agents/synthesis_writer.py`**
  - Lines 412-441: Fixed phonetic data verification (uses correct attribute `verse_commentaries`)
  - Lines 702-722: Updated `_generate_introduction()` type hints
  - Lines 784-806: Updated `_generate_verse_commentary()` type hints
  - Lines 845-896: Fixed `_format_macro_for_prompt()` with `get_value()` helper
  - Lines 898-982: Fixed `_format_micro_for_prompt()` with phonetic extraction

- **`src/agents/master_editor.py`**
  - Lines 533-622: Fixed `_format_analysis_for_prompt()` with same pattern

### Evidence of Success

- ✅ Psalm 145 pipeline runs successfully without `AttributeError`
- ✅ Debug prompts (`verse_prompt_psalm_145.txt`) contain phonetic data for all 21 verses
- ✅ Log verification: "✓ Phonetic transcription data FOUND and passed to synthesis writer"
- ✅ Test script (`test_synthesis_fix.py`) passes all 4 tests (Pydantic + dict formats)

   - Regenerated Psalm 145 print-ready file with all verse commentary present
   - Confirmed all 21 verses have actual commentary (no more "[Commentary not found]")

### Key Results from Testing

**Psalm 145 Comparison (Synthesis vs. Editor):**

Both stages now demonstrate excellent figurative language usage:

**Synthesis Writer (Claude Sonnet 4.5):**
- Verse 7 ("pour forth"): Cited Isa 59:7, Prov 18:4, Ps 78:2, Ps 119:171 with frequency data (11 occurrences)
- Verse 16 ("open hand"): Cited Deut 15:8, 15:11, Ps 104:28 with pattern analysis

## Current Pipeline Status

**Phase 4 Pipeline - FULLY OPERATIONAL:**
```
Step 1: MacroAnalyst → Structural thesis
Step 2: MicroAnalyst v2 → Discovery + optimized research requests
Step 3: ScholarResearcher → Research bundle (enhanced with figurative summaries)
Step 4: SynthesisWriter → Introduction + verse commentary (with figurative language integration)
Step 5: MasterEditor (GPT-5) → Editorial review (with figurative language validation)
Step 6: CommentaryFormatter → Print-ready output (bug fixed)
```

**Recent Test Runs:**
- ✅ Psalm 23 (6 verses) - Complete pipeline with figurative enhancements
- ✅ Psalm 145 (21 verses) - Print-ready file regenerated with all commentary
- 🔄 Psalm 23 still running Master Editor stage (background)

**Cost Per Psalm:**
- Claude Sonnet 4.5: ~$0.07
- GPT-5 Master Editor: ~$0.50-0.75
- **Total: ~$0.57-0.82 per psalm**

**Quality Metrics:**
- ~95% publication-ready
- Scholarly with specific citations
- Figurative language now properly integrated
- No "LLM-ish breathlessness"

---

## Next Priorities (Post-Fix Validation)

### Immediate (Next Session):

1. **Validate Master Editor Fix for Psalm 145**
   - Re-run the pipeline for Psalm 145, skipping to the `master_editor` step.
   - Compare the new `psalm_145_edited_verses.md` with `psalm_145_synthesis_verses.md`.
   - **Expected Outcome**: The editor's commentary should be longer and clearly engage with the phonetic and figurative details provided by the synthesizer.

2. **Validate figurative language improvements across multiple psalms**
   - Run 2-3 more test psalms (recommended: Psalm 1, Psalm 29)
   - Verify consistent citation quality
   - Confirm pattern analysis appears in all outputs

3. **Optional: GPT-5 Raw Comparison**
   - Compare enhanced pipeline with GPT-5 raw baseline
   - Quantify value of figurative language database
   - Document specific examples where research adds value

### Short Term (1-2 Sessions):

4. **Production Run Decision**
   - Test 3-5 diverse psalms to validate quality across genres
   - Decide: Full 150 psalms (~$85-123) or selective 50-75 (~$28-61)
   - Consider implementing Claude batch API for 50% cost savings

5. **Optional Enhancements** (if desired):
   - Implement cross-reference footnotes linking figurative instances
   - Generate "Figurative Language Index" at end of commentary
   - Add relevance scoring for better top-3 selection

---

## Known Issues & Considerations

### Resolved This Session:
- ✅ Print-ready formatter bug (verses showing "[Commentary not found]")
- ✅ Figurative language underutilization (from 1.5% to expected 15-25%)

### Future Considerations:
- Psalm 145 editor output shows 20 parsed sections (missing one section note, but has verse 13b content)
- "ways" imagery still appears frequently (100+ instances) - consider adding to avoid list
- Usage breakdown only appears for >10 instances - consider lowering threshold

---

## Research Bundle Enhancements (New Format)

**Example: Verse 7 "pour forth" metaphor (34 instances)**

**OLD FORMAT:**
```markdown
### Query 2
**Filters**: Vehicle contains: bubble | Results: 34

#### Instances:
[First 10 instances...]
...and 24 more instances
```

**NEW FORMAT:**
```markdown
### Query 2
**Filters**: Vehicle contains: bubble
**Results**: 34

**Core pattern**: speech metaphor (28/34 instances, 82%)

**Top 3 Most Relevant** (by confidence):
1. ⭐ **Psalms 19:2** (confidence: 0.95) - Day to day pours forth speech...
2. ⭐ **Psalms 78:2** (confidence: 0.93) - I will pour forth riddles...
3. ⭐ **Psalms 94:4** (confidence: 0.91) - They pour forth insolence...

#### All Instances (34 total):

**Psalms 19:2** (metaphor) - confidence: 0.95
[Full details...]

[First 10 instances with confidence scores...]

*...and 24 more instances*

**Usage breakdown**: speech (28x), water (4x), abundance (2x)
```

**Impact:**
- Synthesis writer can quickly see: 82% speech metaphor
- Top 3 instances immediately accessible
- Usage distribution helps pattern analysis

## SESSION 3 (2025-10-19): Phonetic Pipeline Implementation & Debugging

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Phonetic Pipeline Implementation**: Successfully integrated the `PhoneticAnalyst` into the `MicroAnalyst` agent.
2. **Bug Fix #1 (AttributeError)**: Corrected the `_get_phonetic_transcriptions` method in `micro_analyst.py`.
3. **Bug Fix #2 (Data Integration)**: Fixed data flow issue where phonetic transcriptions weren\'t populating into `MicroAnalysis` object.
4. **Validation**: Confirmed via logs and output files that phonetic transcriptions are correctly generated and saved.

## SESSION 2 (2025-10-19): Comparative Analysis & Critical Discoveries

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Comparative Analysis: GPT-5 Raw vs. Research-Enhanced Pipeline**
   - Generated baseline GPT-5 commentary for Psalm 145 using ONLY raw psalm text
   - Compared with full research-enhanced pipeline output
   - Validated the investment in research infrastructure

2. **CRITICAL FINDING: Figurative Language Database Severely Underutilized**
   - Investigation revealed **1.2-1.8% utilization rate** of figurative language database
   - Database contains 2,863 instances; pipeline only uses 34-51 instances per psalm
   - **NOW RESOLVED in Session 4 with all 4 actions implemented**

3. **Design: Complete Phonetic Transcription System**
   - Created 6 comprehensive design documents (see docs/PHONETIC_*.md)
   - Addresses phonetic error discovered in Psalm 145:16
   - System implemented in Session 3
