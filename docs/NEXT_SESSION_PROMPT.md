## Session Status: MAJOR ENHANCEMENTS COMPLETE! 🎉

### Research Bundle Size Reduction - COMPLETE ✅

Successfully optimized the Micro analyst to be more judicious with research requests, reducing research bundle sizes dramatically while maintaining quality.

**Previous Session Achievements:**
- ✅ More selective lexicon requests (avoiding common words like יוֹם, לֵב, יָד, עַיִן, פֶּה, דֶּרֶךְ)
- ✅ More selective figurative language searches (avoiding common body parts and theological terms)
- ✅ Intelligent proportional trimming across all search results
- ✅ Fixed trimming bugs (section name matching)
- ✅ Optimized context limits (330k intro, 320k verse commentary)
- ✅ Print-ready formatting improvements (3-space separation for Hebrew/English)

### NEW: Question-Driven Commentary & Enhanced Documentation - COMPLETE ✅

**What Was Achieved This Session:**
- ✅ **Micro Analyst Questions**: Now generates 5-10 interesting questions about unusual words, phrases, poetic devices
- ✅ **Question Propagation**: Questions from both Macro and Micro analysts passed to Synthesizer and Master Editor
- ✅ **Question Answering**: Both Synthesizer and Editor explicitly instructed to address interesting questions
- ✅ **Unusual Phrase Emphasis**: Enhanced prompts to comment on distinctive Hebrew turns of phrase (e.g., הֲ֭דַר כְּב֣וֹד הוֹדֶ֑ךָ, עֱז֣וּז נֽוֹרְאֹתֶ֣יךָ)
- ✅ **Flexible Verse Length**: Editor now explicitly allowed to write 400+ word verse commentaries when warranted
- ✅ **Pipeline Summary**: New module tracks token counts, research requests/returns, questions generated
- ✅ **Model Attribution**: Print-ready output now includes models used at bottom

**Psalm 145 Results (21 verses):**
- Research bundle: 259k chars (~130k tokens) - fits comfortably without trimming!
- Lexicon: 36 words (down from potential 50+)
- Figurative: 11 queries with 393 instances (down from 19 queries with 817 instances)
- Total reduction: ~22% smaller, much higher quality

## Key Improvements This Session

### NEW: Question-Driven Commentary System

**Overview**: The Micro Analyst now generates interesting questions about unusual words, phrases, and poetic devices. These questions, along with Macro research questions, are passed to the Synthesizer and Master Editor, who are explicitly instructed to address them in the commentary.

**Implementation** (`src/agents/micro_analyst.py`, `src/schemas/analysis_schemas.py`):

#### 1. Micro Analyst Questions Generation (lines 110-142)
- **New section in discovery prompt**: Instructs agent to formulate 5-10 interesting questions after verse discoveries
- **Question types**: Unusual word choices, striking poetic devices, grammatical patterns, theological moves, interpretive puzzles
- **Examples provided**:
  - "Why did the poet choose 'בְּנֵי אֵלִים' (sons of gods) rather than a more monotheistic formulation?"
  - "What is the function of the unusual phrase 'הֲדַר כְּבוֹד הוֹדֶךָ'?"
  - "Why does the psalmist shift from perfect tense to imperfect at verse 7?"

#### 2. Schema Updates
- **MicroAnalysis dataclass**: Added `interesting_questions: List[str]` field
- **to_markdown()**: Now includes "Interesting Questions" section
- **from_dict()**: Handles interesting_questions field

#### 3. Question Propagation to Synthesizer (`src/agents/synthesis_writer.py`)
- **INTRODUCTION_ESSAY_PROMPT** (line 68): Added instruction to address answerable questions from both Macro and Micro analysts
- **VERSE_COMMENTARY_PROMPT** (line 223): Added instruction to address relevant questions when commenting on specific verses
- **_format_micro_for_prompt()** (lines 779-825): Now includes interesting_questions in formatted output

#### 4. Question Propagation to Master Editor (`src/agents/master_editor.py`)
- **MASTER_EDITOR_PROMPT** (line 97): Added to MISSED OPPORTUNITIES checklist
- **Editorial Assessment** (line 149): Added question about whether answerable questions were addressed
- **Revised Introduction** (line 158): Explicitly instructs to address answerable questions
- **Revised Verse Commentary** (line 177): Added as item to include when relevant
- **_format_analysis_for_prompt()**: Now includes interesting_questions from micro analysis

### NEW: Emphasis on Unusual Phrases and Poetic Devices

**Overview**: Both Synthesizer and Master Editor now have explicit instructions to comment on unusual Hebrew turns of phrase and poetic devices in verse-by-verse commentary.

**Implementation**:

#### 1. Synthesis Writer (`src/agents/synthesis_writer.py`)
- **VERSE_COMMENTARY_PROMPT** (lines 201-209): New bullet under "Poetics" section:
  - Explicitly mentions unusual turns of phrase (examples: הֲ֭דַר כְּב֣וֹד הוֹדֶ֑ךָ, עֱז֣וּז נֽוֹרְאֹתֶ֣יךָ)
  - Asks "What makes them distinctive? How do they function poetically?"
- **IMPORTANT NOTES** (line 289): Added emphasis that unusual Hebrew phrases, idioms, wordplay should be commented on
- **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS** (line 307): Added final emphasis on unusual turns of phrase as what makes commentary valuable

#### 2. Master Editor (`src/agents/master_editor.py`)
- **MISSED OPPORTUNITIES** (line 96): Added as explicit item to check for
- **Editorial Assessment** (line 151): Added question about whether unusual phrases were adequately commented on
- **Revised Verse Commentary** (line 165): New dedicated bullet point for unusual turns of phrase with examples
- **Final emphasis** (line 179): "Make sure to comment on unusual turns of phrase, distinctive Hebrew idioms, and poetic devices"

### NEW: Flexible Verse Commentary Length

**Overview**: Master Editor now explicitly authorized to write longer verse commentaries (400+ words) when there's genuinely interesting material to illuminate.

**Implementation** (`src/agents/master_editor.py`):

- **Line 164**: Changed from "150-400 words" to explicitly state "can and should be longer—400+ words—if there's genuinely interesting material"
- **Examples of warranting length**: Unusual Hebrew phrases, complex poetic devices, significant textual variants, important interpretive questions
- **Philosophy**: Let content determine length - don't artificially constrain

### NEW: Pipeline Summary Documentation

**Overview**: Comprehensive tracking of all pipeline statistics - token counts, research requests/returns, questions generated, timing.

**Implementation** (`src/utils/pipeline_summary.py` - NEW FILE):

#### PipelineSummaryTracker Class
- **Step Tracking**: `track_step_input()`, `track_step_output()` for token/char counts
- **Research Tracking**:
  - `track_research_requests()` - Captures lexicon words, figurative terms, concordance queries, commentary verses
  - `track_research_bundle()` - Records what was returned (counts per category)
- **Question Tracking**: `track_macro_questions()`, `track_micro_questions()`
- **Timing**: Tracks duration for each step
- **Output**: Generates both markdown report and JSON stats file

#### Integration (`scripts/run_enhanced_pipeline.py`)
- **Initialization** (line 77): Creates tracker
- **Each step**: Tracks input, output, questions, timing
- **Research step**: Tracks requests and returns
- **Complete**: Generates `psalm_XXX_pipeline_summary.md` and `psalm_XXX_pipeline_stats.json`

```

---

## Previous Session Improvements

### 1. Micro Analyst Optimization

**Lexicon Requests** (`src/agents/micro_analyst.py` lines 159-167):
- **Be highly judicious** - only genuinely puzzling/rare/theologically significant words
- **Avoid common words**: יוֹם, אִישׁ, אֶרֶץ, שָׁמַיִם, לֵב, יָד, עַיִן, פֶּה, דֶּרֶךְ, בָּשָׂר
- **Scaled by psalm length**:
  - Psalms >15 verses: 12-18 requests
  - Psalms 10-15 verses: 15-22 requests
  - Psalms <10 verses: 25-30 requests

**Figurative Language Requests** (`src/agents/micro_analyst.py` lines 177-196):
- **Be selective** - only vivid, unusual, or theologically rich imagery
- **Avoid very common imagery**: hand, eye/gaze, mouth, heart, face, ear (unless surprising)
- **Avoid common theological terms**: mercy, fear, bless, praise (unless central)
- **Focus on**: Unusual metaphors, nature imagery, architectural imagery, rare verbs
- **Scaled by psalm length**:
  - Psalms >15 verses: 8-12 searches
  - Psalms 10-15 verses: 10-15 searches
  - Psalms <10 verses: 12-18 searches
- **Include morphological variations**: singular/plural, base verbs/gerunds

### 2. Intelligent Proportional Trimming

**Implementation** (`src/agents/synthesis_writer.py` lines 444-511):

Instead of cutting off entire search terms, the new algorithm:
1. Calculates trim ratio based on available space (e.g., 68%)
2. Applies ratio proportionally to EACH query
3. Keeps at least 1 instance per query (no search term lost completely)
4. Adds note: `[N more instances omitted for space]`

**Benefits:**
- Every search term remains represented
- Maintains diversity across all figurative imagery
- More balanced representation

**Example:**
```
Query 1: fathom (15 results) → keep 68% = 10 instances, omit 5
Query 2: bubble (34 results) → keep 68% = 23 instances, omit 11
Query 3: nostril (40 results) → keep 68% = 27 instances, omit 13
```

### 3. Fixed Trimming Bugs

**Section Name Matching** (`src/agents/synthesis_writer.py` lines 476-485):
- **Bug**: Matching "Lexicon" in first 50 chars caught "Research Summary" (which contains word "Lexicon")
- **Fix**: Now extracts section header (first line only) and matches precisely
- **Result**: Lexicon section (144k chars) no longer lost in trimming

**Optimized Limits** (`src/agents/synthesis_writer.py` lines 559-562, 630-634):
- **Introduction**: 330k chars max (~165k tokens) - 90% of theoretical max (340k)
- **Verse commentary**: 320k chars max (~160k tokens) - 90% of theoretical max (334k)
- **Result**: Most psalms (even long ones like 145) fit without any trimming needed

### 4. Print-Ready Formatting Fix

**Hebrew/English Separation** (`src/utils/commentary_formatter.py` line 99):
- **Change**: Hebrew and English on same line, separated by 3 spaces
- **Format**: `1. לַמְנַצֵּחַ...   For the leader. A psalm of David.`
- **Benefit**: Better RTL/LTR handling in Word without causing formatting issues

## NEW: GPT-5 Raw Comparison Tool (Session 2025-10-19)

### What Was Created

A new comparison script that generates commentary using **ONLY GPT-5 (o1)** with raw psalm text, allowing direct comparison with the research-enhanced pipeline.

**Files Created:**
- `scripts/gpt5_raw_comparison.py` - Main comparison script
- `docs/GPT5_RAW_COMPARISON.md` - Complete documentation

**Purpose:**
Compare what GPT-5 can produce with only instructions and psalm text versus what the full pipeline produces with macro/micro analysis + research bundle + synthesis + master editing.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Interactive mode (prompts for psalm number)
python scripts/gpt5_raw_comparison.py

# Command-line mode
python scripts/gpt5_raw_comparison.py 23
python scripts/gpt5_raw_comparison.py 145
```

**What GPT-5 Raw Does NOT Have:**
- BDB lexicon entries (~70k tokens)
- Concordance data showing usage patterns
- Figurative language database (40K+ instances)
- Traditional commentary (Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Radak)
- Ugaritic parallels from RAG
- Macro structural thesis
- Micro verse discoveries
- Research questions from analysts

**Comparison Value:**
- Assess research bundle value (what insights require actual research vs. GPT-5 knowledge)
- Evaluate macro/micro analysis contribution
- Measure quality difference between raw generation and research-enhanced pipeline
- Validate that the ~$0.50-0.75 investment in research is worthwhile

**Output Files:**
- `output/gpt5_raw/psalm_XXX_gpt5_raw.md` - Complete commentary
- `output/gpt5_raw/psalm_XXX_gpt5_raw_intro.md` - Introduction only
- `output/gpt5_raw/psalm_XXX_gpt5_raw_verses.md` - Verses only

**Cost:** ~$0.50-0.75 per psalm (GPT-5 pricing)
