# Session Management Guide

## Purpose
This document defines protocols for maintaining project documentation across work sessions, ensuring continuity and tracking progress.

---

## Session Start Protocol

### 1. Read These Documents First (in order)
- [ ] `docs/CONTEXT.md` - Quick project overview
- [ ] `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Current task and progress
- [ ] `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md` - Recent learnings (last 2-3 entries)

### 2. Session Initialization Prompt

Use this exact prompt when starting a new session:

```
I'm continuing work on the Psalms AI commentary pipeline.

Please read these files in order:
1. docs/CONTEXT.md (project overview)
2. docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md (current status)
3. docs/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md (scroll to most recent entry)

Based on PROJECT_STATUS.md, what is the next task I should work on?
```

### 3. Confirm Understanding
The AI assistant should respond by:
- Confirming current phase and day
- Summarizing the next task
- Noting any blockers from PROJECT_STATUS.md
- Referencing recent learnings from IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md

---

## During Session Protocol

### Document Updates (Continuous)

#### IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md - Update As You Go
Add entries in real-time for:
- ‚úÖ Key learnings or "aha!" moments
- ‚úÖ Decisions made and their rationale
- ‚úÖ Issues encountered and solutions
- ‚úÖ Useful code snippets
- ‚úÖ Performance metrics

**When to update**:
- Immediately after solving a problem
- When making an architectural decision
- After discovering something surprising
- When completing a meaningful sub-task

#### PROJECT_STATUS.md - Update After Each Task
Update checklist items:
- Mark completed tasks with ‚úÖ
- Update progress percentages
- Add/remove blockers
- Update metrics (costs, psalms processed, etc.)

**When to update**:
- After completing each checklist item
- When discovering new blockers
- When processing costs/metrics change

---

## Session End Protocol

### Mandatory End-of-Session Updates

#### 1. IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md
Add a session summary:

```markdown
### End of Session - [TIME]
**Duration**: [X hours]
**Tasks Completed**:
- [Task 1]
- [Task 2]

**Key Outcomes**:
- [Outcome 1]
- [Outcome 2]

**Decisions Made**:
- [Decision + rationale]

**For Next Session**:
- [ ] [Next immediate task]
- [ ] [Following task]

**Blockers**:
- [Any issues to address]

---
```

#### 2. PROJECT_STATUS.md
Update the following sections:
```markdown
## Current Task
- [x] [Completed items from this session]
- [ ] [Remaining items - update as needed]

## Progress
- Overall: X% complete (updated)
- Current phase: Y% complete (updated)

## Completed
‚úÖ [Add newly completed items here]

## Blockers
[Update any new blockers or remove resolved ones]

## Metrics
- Psalms processed: X/150 (updated)
- Total cost so far: $X.XX (updated)
- Average cost per psalm: $X.XX (calculated)

## Quick Links
- Last session: [TODAY'S DATE, brief topic]
```

#### 3. Git Commit
Always commit at end of session:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Day X: [Brief description of work completed]

- [Specific achievement 1]
- [Specific achievement 2]
- [Specific achievement 3]

Next: [Next task from PROJECT_STATUS.md]"
```

---

## Quality Checklist

### Before Ending Session

- [ ] IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md has entry for today with:
  - Date and session duration
  - Key learnings
  - Decisions with rationale
  - Issues and solutions
  - Next steps

- [ ] PROJECT_STATUS.md reflects current state:
  - Checkboxes updated
  - Progress percentages accurate
  - Metrics current
  - "Last session" updated with today's date

- [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md updated if:
  - New schemas added
  - New functions implemented
  - New patterns established

- [ ] All code changes committed with descriptive message

- [ ] No secrets/API keys in committed files

---

## Document Maintenance Schedule

### Daily (Every Session)
- ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md: Add session entry
- ‚úÖ PROJECT_STATUS.md: Update checklists and metrics
- ‚úÖ Git commit with descriptive message

### As Needed
- ‚öôÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE.md: Add schemas/APIs as implemented
- ‚öôÔ∏è CONTEXT.md: Update if project scope or approach changes

### Weekly (Every 5 days / End of Phase)
- üìä PROJECT_STATUS.md: Review phase completion
- üìä IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md: Add weekly summary
- üìä CONTEXT.md: Update cost estimates based on actuals

### End of Project
- üìù Final summary in IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md
- üìù Complete metrics in PROJECT_STATUS.md
- üìù Usage guide for generated materials

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Don't**: Start session without reading status docs
‚úÖ **Do**: Always read CONTEXT ‚Üí PROJECT_STATUS ‚Üí IMPLEMENTATION_LOG first

‚ùå **Don't**: Wait until end of session to update logs
‚úÖ **Do**: Update IMPLEMENTATION_LOG as you learn/decide things

‚ùå **Don't**: Use vague commit messages ("updates", "fixes")
‚úÖ **Do**: Describe what changed and why

‚ùå **Don't**: Forget to update progress percentages
‚úÖ **Do**: Update percentages after each task completion

‚ùå **Don't**: Leave blockers unaddressed in status
‚úÖ **Do**: Document blockers immediately and note when resolved

---

## Template Reminders

### Quick Session End Checklist
```
‚ñ° Implementation log updated with session summary
‚ñ° Project status checklists updated
‚ñ° Progress percentages recalculated
‚ñ° Metrics updated (if applicable)
‚ñ° "Last session" field updated with today's date
‚ñ° Git commit with descriptive message
‚ñ° No API keys or secrets committed
```

### AI Assistant Session End Prompt
At end of session, use:

```
We're ending this session. Please help me update the project documentation:

1. Review what we accomplished today
2. Generate an IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md entry for this session
3. Update PROJECT_STATUS.md with:
   - Completed tasks (check boxes)
   - Updated progress percentages
   - New metrics if applicable
   - "Last session" field with today's date
4. Suggest a git commit message describing today's work
```

---

## Why This Matters

**Continuity**: Next session starts where this one left off, no time wasted reconstructing context

**Accountability**: Clear record of progress, decisions, and learnings

**Debugging**: When issues arise, IMPLEMENTATION_LOG shows what changed and when

**Cost Tracking**: Accurate metrics help stay within budget

**Knowledge Transfer**: Anyone (including future you) can understand project state and history

*This protocol ensures project momentum and makes every session productive.*
*Treat these updates as part of the work, not optional extras.*
