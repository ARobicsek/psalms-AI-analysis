## Key Decisions Made
1. **Project location**: `C:\Users\ariro\OneDrive\Documents\Psalms`
2. **Repository**: https://github.com/ARobicsek/psalms-AI-analysis
3. **Primary models**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (analysis/writing), Claude Haiku 4.5 (research/critique)
4. **Database**: SQLite for concordance and output storage
5. **Hebrew search**: 4-layer strategy (consonantal, voweled, exact, lemma)
6. **Analysis approach**: Three-pass telescopic (macro → micro → synthesis)
