# Psalms Commentary Project - Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-02 (Session 60)
**Current Phase**: Document Generation & Formatting Fixes

---

## Quick Status

### Completed ✅
- **Liturgical Data Missing from Research Bundle**: The full research bundle now correctly includes liturgical data generated by the `LiturgicalLibrarian`.
- **Hebrew Text Integration**: Master Editor and Synthesis Writer now include Hebrew source text when quoting sources (prompt updated).
- **Programmatic Verse Text Insertion**: Hebrew verse text automatically inserted before each verse commentary in `.docx` (Aptos 12pt).
- **Divine Names Modification**: All Hebrew text (verse text, quoted sources) properly modified for non-sacred rendering.
- **Liturgical Librarian Output**: Confirmed integration in research bundles with detailed summaries (prompt updated for Master Editor).
- **is_unique=0 Filtering**: Phrases appearing in multiple psalms are now filtered out before LLM processing.
- **Removed Extra LLM Calls**: Validation is now implicit in summary generation - no separate validation calls.
- **Minimal Research Bundle**: Bundle contains ONLY phrase/verse identifiers and LLM summaries - no metadata.
- **Improved LLM Reasoning**: Both phrase and full psalm summaries correctly distinguish main prayers from supplementary material.
- **Field Labeling**: Updated to use ONLY canonical fields (canonical_L1-L4, canonical_location_description).
- **Cost Control**: LLM receives maximum 5 matches per group per verse/phrase/chapter.
- **DOCX Header Formatting**: Markdown `##` headers now correctly rendered as level 2 headings in `.docx`.
- **DOCX Bidi Parentheses**: Parentheses around Hebrew phrases now render correctly (bidi issue resolved).

### Pending ⚠️
- **Hebrew Font/Size in Parentheses**: Hebrew text within parentheses is Arial 11pt instead of Aptos 12pt. This issue is deferred.

### Next Up 📋
- **Investigate Research Bundle Assembly**: Determine why liturgical data is missing from the `psalm_001_research_v2.md` file and fix the assembly process.
- **Pipeline Integration**: Run complete pipeline with all fixes and verify output.
- **Quality Assessment**: Review generated commentary to ensure all content and formatting is correct.

## Session 60 Summary

- **Goal**: Address various formatting and content integration issues in the generated commentary documents.
- **Activity**:
    - Fixed missing Hebrew verse text in `.docx` output.
    - Fixed incorrect `##` header formatting in `.docx`.
    - Implemented a robust fix for bidirectional parentheses rendering issues.
    - Attempted to fix Hebrew font/size in parentheses, but encountered critical document generation failures when forcing `cs_font.name`. Reverted these changes.
    - Identified that the full research bundle (`psalm_001_research_v2.md`) is missing liturgical data, which is the root cause of agents not using it.
- **Outcome**: Document generation is stable, most formatting issues resolved. Liturgical data integration and specific font issues deferred.

## Session 59 Summary

- **Goal**: Integrate Hebrew source text in commentary, programmatically add verse text, ensure divine names modification works.
- **Activity**:
    - Updated Master Editor and Synthesis Writer prompts to include Hebrew text when quoting sources
    - Created `_insert_verse_text_into_commentary()` method in commentary_formatter.py
    - Verified divine names modifier handles all Hebrew text additions
    - Confirmed liturgical librarian output is properly integrated in research bundles
- **Outcome**: Commentary now serves readers familiar with biblical and rabbinic Hebrew. Hebrew verse text programmatically inserted before each commentary. Divine names modification applied to all Hebrew text.

## Session 58 Summary

- **Goal**: Fix is_unique=0 bug, remove extra LLM calls, and simplify research bundle to minimal structure.
- **Activity**:
    - Fixed is_unique=0 filtering bug - added filter in `_group_by_psalm_phrase` to exclude phrase_match items with is_unique=0
    - Removed separate LLM validation calls - disabled `_validate_phrase_groups_with_llm` (validation now implicit in summary generation)
    - Simplified research bundle structure - removed all raw match data and metadata, bundle now contains ONLY phrase/verse + LLM summaries
    - Created `view_research_bundle.py` script to view the exact minimal bundle passed to commentary agents
    - Created `RESEARCH_BUNDLE_VIEWING_GUIDE.md` documentation
- **Outcome**: Research bundle is now minimal and clean - exactly what Master Editor and Synthesis Writer need. 14 non-unique phrases filtered out, reducing Psalm 1 from 9 to 6 phrase groups. Lower LLM costs due to removed validation calls.

## Session 57 Summary

- **Goal**: Fix the filtering bug and enhance LLM reasoning to correctly distinguish main prayers from supplementary material.
- **Activity**:
    - Fixed the filtering bug by wrapping Hebrew text printing in try-except blocks
    - Added explicit filtering in `generate_research_bundle` to exclude phrase groups marked as "FILTERED:"
    - Enhanced validation with heuristic pre-filter and strengthened LLM validation prompts
    - Improved LLM reasoning to correctly distinguish main prayers from supplementary material
    - Updated field labels to "Main prayer in this liturgical block"
- **Outcome**: All critical issues with Liturgical Librarian resolved. Output quality significantly improved.

## Session 56 Summary

- **Goal**: Stabilize the `LiturgicalLibrarian` and address user feedback on output quality.
- **Activity**:
    - Resolved a chain of `AttributeError` exceptions by implementing missing methods (`_prioritize_matches_by_type`, `_validate_summary_quality`, etc.).
    - Achieved a successful, error-free run of the test script.
    - Began addressing a new round of detailed feedback, implementing changes to grouping logic, LLM prompts, and cost-saving measures.
    - Identified a critical bug where the LLM-based filtering of false positives is not being correctly applied to the final results.
- **Outcome**: The `LiturgicalLibrarian` is more robust, but a key filtering bug persists. The project is paused pending a focused effort to resolve this bug in the next session.

## Session 55 Summary

- **Goal**: Debug and fix the `LiturgicalLibrarian` agent.
- **Activity**: 
    - Addressed multiple `AttributeError` exceptions by restoring missing methods (`generate_research_bundle`, `_get_db_connection`, `_prioritize_matches_by_type`, `_merge_overlapping_phrase_groups`) and correcting attribute names in the test script.
    - Due to repeated errors and file inconsistencies, the entire `src/agents/liturgical_librarian.py` file was rewritten to a known good state.
- **Outcome**: The code should now be in a stable state, ready for a full test run.
