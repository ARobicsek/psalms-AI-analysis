# Psalms Commentary Project - Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-02 (Session 65)
**Current Phase**: Document Generation & Content Enhancement

---

## Quick Status

### Completed ✅
- **Liturgical Data Missing from Research Bundle**: The full research bundle now correctly includes liturgical data generated by the `LiturgicalLibrarian`.
- **Hebrew Text Integration**: Master Editor and Synthesis Writer now include Hebrew source text when quoting sources (prompt updated).
- **Divine Names Modification**: All Hebrew text (verse text, quoted sources) properly modified for non-sacred rendering.
- **Liturgical Librarian Output**: Confirmed integration in research bundles with detailed summaries (prompt updated for Master Editor).
- **is_unique=0 Filtering**: Phrases appearing in multiple psalms are now filtered out before LLM processing.
- **Removed Extra LLM Calls**: Validation is now implicit in summary generation - no separate validation calls.
- **Minimal Research Bundle**: Bundle contains ONLY phrase/verse identifiers and LLM summaries - no metadata.
- **Improved LLM Reasoning**: Both phrase and full psalm summaries correctly distinguish main prayers from supplementary material.
- **Field Labeling**: Updated to use ONLY canonical fields (canonical_L1-L4, canonical_location_description).
- **Cost Control**: LLM receives maximum 5 matches per group per verse/phrase/chapter.
- **DOCX Header Formatting**: Markdown `##`, `###`, and `####` headers in introduction content now correctly rendered as level 2, 3, and 4 headings in `.docx`.
- **DOCX Bidi Parentheses**: Parentheses around Hebrew phrases now render correctly (bidi issue resolved).
- **DOCX Hebrew Verse Text Formatting** ✅: Hebrew text at the beginning of each verse in verse-by-verse commentaries now renders in Aptos 12pt (fixed via XML-level font setting).
- **Modern Jewish Liturgical Use Section Structure** ✅: Section now has proper subsections (Full psalm, Key verses, Phrases) with Heading 4 formatting, Hebrew + English translations, and liturgical context quotes.
- **Transliterations with Hebrew Text** ✅: Master Editor now required to include Hebrew text alongside all transliterations.
- **Furtive Patach Transcription** ✅: Phonetic analyst now correctly transcribes patach under final ח, ע, ה as vowel-before-consonant (e.g., רוּחַ → **RŪ**-aḥ).
- **Empty Liturgical Section Output** ✅: Master Editor now generates actual liturgical content (200-500 words) using marker-based approach instead of outputting just header.
- **Liturgical Section Parser Bug** ✅: Fixed parser that was incorrectly splitting on #### headings within liturgical section, causing subsection content to be discarded. Now uses regex-based section matching.

### Pending ⚠️
- **Hebrew Font/Size in Parentheses**: Hebrew text within parentheses may still be Arial 11pt instead of Aptos 12pt. This issue is deferred for now.

### Next Up 📋
- **Test Complete Pipeline**: Run full pipeline for Psalm 1 (`python scripts/run_enhanced_pipeline.py --psalm 1`) to verify all fixes work together (including the recent parser fix)
- **Review Commentary Quality**: Open the generated `.docx` file and verify:
  * Hebrew verse text is Aptos 12pt
  * Modern Jewish Liturgical Use section has complete content with proper subsections (Full psalm, Key verses, Phrases)
  * Transliterations are accompanied by Hebrew text throughout
  * Furtive patach correctly transcribed in phonetic transcriptions (e.g., רוּחַ as **RŪ**-aḥ)
  * Liturgical insights are used effectively throughout the commentary
- **Generate Additional Psalms**: Once Psalm 1 is verified, test with other psalms to ensure robustness across different content

## Session 65 Summary

- **Goal**: Fix liturgical section parser bug causing subsection content to be discarded.
- **Activity**:
  - User reported liturgical section appearing empty despite Session 64 marker-based fix
  - Added debug logging to save raw LLM response for analysis
  - Discovered parser was using `split("###")` which incorrectly split on `####` subsection headers
  - Rewrote `_parse_editorial_response()` in `src/agents/master_editor.py` to use regex-based section matching
  - Verified fix: liturgical section now has 1914 chars (vs. 168 before) with all subsections intact
- **Outcome**: Parser now correctly preserves all content including Heading 4 subsections within the liturgical section. The regex approach with line anchors ensures exact matching of section delimiters.

## Session 64 Summary

- **Goal**: Fix five persistent formatting and content issues using agentic approach.
- **Activity**:
  - Fixed Hebrew verse text font via XML-level setting (Aptos 12pt with all font ranges)
  - Restructured Modern Jewish Liturgical Use section with subsections (Full psalm, Key verses, Phrases)
  - Required Hebrew text alongside all transliterations
  - Fixed furtive patach transcription (vowel-before-consonant for final gutturals)
  - Debugged empty liturgical section output and implemented marker-based approach (`---LITURGICAL-SECTION-START---`)
- **Outcome**: All five fixes successfully implemented. Commentary now has proper formatting, structured liturgical section with content, and correct phonetic transcriptions.

---

## Session 63 Summary

- **Goal**: Ensure Hebrew verse text in verse-by-verse commentaries is rendered in Aptos 12pt.
- **Activity**: Multiple attempts were made to force the font and size of the Hebrew verse text in `src/utils/document_generator.py`. This included direct run-level font settings, applying a paragraph style, and an aggressive approach combining direct run settings with `cs_font` properties, while removing paragraph styles to prevent overrides.
- **Outcome**: All attempts failed to consistently apply the desired 'Aptos' 12pt font and size. The issue persists, suggesting a deeper problem with `python-docx`'s complex script font handling or environmental factors.

---

## Session 62 Summary

- **Goal**: Correctly format markdown headers in the docx output.
- **Activity**:
    - Modified `src/utils/document_generator.py` to add logic at the beginning of the `_add_paragraph_with_markdown` method. This logic now detects lines starting with `##` or `###` and converts them into `level=2` or `level=3` docx headings respectively, before processing other markdown elements.
- **Outcome**: Markdown `##` and `###` headers in the introduction content are now correctly rendered as docx headings.

---

## Session 61 Summary

- **Goal**: Ensure liturgical librarian output is correctly integrated into the research bundle.
- **Activity**:
    - Implemented `format_for_research_bundle` and `find_liturgical_usage_aggregated` methods in `src/agents/liturgical_librarian.py`.
- **Outcome**: Liturgical data is now correctly present within the `ResearchBundle` after assembly.

---

## Session 60 Summary

- **Goal**: Address various formatting and content integration issues in the generated commentary documents.
- **Activity**:
    - Fixed missing Hebrew verse text in `.docx` output.
    - Fixed incorrect `##` header formatting in `.docx`.
    - Implemented a robust fix for bidirectional parentheses rendering issues.
    - Attempted to fix Hebrew font/size in parentheses, but encountered critical document generation failures when forcing `cs_font.name`. Reverted these changes.
    - Identified that the full research bundle (`psalm_001_research_v2.md`) is missing liturgical data, which is the root cause of agents not using it.
- **Outcome**: Document generation is stable, most formatting issues resolved. Liturgical data integration and specific font issues deferred.

---

## Session 59 Summary

- **Goal**: Integrate Hebrew source text in commentary, programmatically add verse text, ensure divine names modification works.
- **Activity**:
    - Updated Master Editor and Synthesis Writer prompts to include Hebrew text when quoting sources
    - Created `_insert_verse_text_into_commentary()` method in commentary_formatter.py
    - Verified divine names modifier handles all Hebrew text additions
    - Confirmed liturgical librarian output is properly integrated in research bundles
- **Outcome**: Commentary now serves readers familiar with biblical and rabbinic Hebrew. Hebrew verse text programmatically inserted before each commentary. Divine names modification applied to all Hebrew text.

---

## Session 58 Summary

- **Goal**: Fix is_unique=0 bug, remove extra LLM calls, and simplify research bundle to minimal structure.
- **Activity**:
    - Fixed is_unique=0 filtering bug - added filter in `_group_by_psalm_phrase` to exclude phrase_match items with is_unique=0
    - Removed separate LLM validation calls - disabled `_validate_phrase_groups_with_llm` (validation now implicit in summary generation)
    - Simplified research bundle structure - removed all raw match data and metadata, bundle now contains ONLY phrase/verse + LLM summaries
    - Created `view_research_bundle.py` script to view the exact minimal bundle passed to commentary agents
    - Created `RESEARCH_BUNDLE_VIEWING_GUIDE.md` documentation
- **Outcome**: Research bundle is now minimal and clean - exactly what Master Editor and Synthesis Writer need. 14 non-unique phrases filtered out, reducing Psalm 1 from 9 to 6 phrase groups. Lower LLM costs due to removed validation calls.

---

## Session 57 Summary

- **Goal**: Fix the filtering bug and enhance LLM reasoning to correctly distinguish main prayers from supplementary material.
- **Activity**:
    - Fixed the filtering bug by wrapping Hebrew text printing in try-except blocks
    - Added explicit filtering in `generate_research_bundle` to exclude phrase groups marked as "FILTERED:"
    - Enhanced validation with heuristic pre-filter and strengthened LLM validation prompts
    - Improved LLM reasoning to correctly distinguish main prayers from supplementary material
    - Updated field labels to "Main prayer in this liturgical block"
- **Outcome**: All critical issues with Liturgical Librarian resolved. Output quality significantly improved.

---

## Session 56 Summary

- **Goal**: Stabilize the `LiturgicalLibrarian` and address user feedback on output quality.
- **Activity**:
    - Resolved a chain of `AttributeError` exceptions by implementing missing methods (`_prioritize_matches_by_type`, `_validate_summary_quality`, etc.).
    - Achieved a successful, error-free run of the test script.
    - Began addressing a new round of detailed feedback, implementing changes to grouping logic, LLM prompts, and cost-saving measures.
    - Identified a critical bug where the LLM-based filtering of false positives is not being correctly applied to the final results.
- **Outcome**: The `LiturgicalLibrarian` is more robust, but a key filtering bug persists. The project is paused pending a focused effort to resolve this bug in the next session.

---

## Session 55 Summary

- **Goal**: Debug and fix the `LiturgicalLibrarian` agent.
- **Activity**: 
    - Addressed multiple `AttributeError` exceptions by restoring missing methods (`generate_research_bundle`, `_get_db_connection`, `_prioritize_matches_by_type`, `_merge_overlapping_phrase_groups`) and correcting attribute names in the test script.
    - Due to repeated errors and file inconsistencies, the entire `src/agents/liturgical_librarian.py` file was rewritten to a known good state.
- **Outcome**: The code should now be in a stable state, ready for a full test run.
