# Fixes Applied to SynthesisWriter (2025-10-17)

## Summary
Fixed two critical issues with the SynthesisWriter agent that were preventing it from accessing full research data.

## Issue 1: Empty Micro Discoveries Section

### Problem
The micro discoveries section in synthesis prompts was completely empty, despite the MicroAnalyst generating rich verse-by-verse commentary.

**Evidence from debug logs:**
```
### MICRO DISCOVERIES


### RESEARCH MATERIALS
```

### Root Cause
Schema mismatch between MicroAnalyst output and SynthesisWriter input parsing:
- **MicroAnalyst v2** outputs: `"verse_commentaries"` (array)
- **SynthesisWriter** was looking for: `"verses"` (array)

The `_format_micro_for_prompt()` method was checking `micro.get('verses', [])` which returned an empty list.

### Fix
Updated `_format_micro_for_prompt()` in [synthesis_writer.py:518-555](synthesis_writer.py#L518-L555):

```python
# Handle both old format ('verses') and new format ('verse_commentaries')
verses = micro.get('verse_commentaries', micro.get('verses', []))

for verse_data in verses:
    verse_num = verse_data.get('verse_number', verse_data.get('verse', 0))
    # ... rest of formatting
```

Also enhanced to include:
- Thematic threads across verses
- Synthesis notes for research priorities

### Impact
**Before:** Synthesizer had NO access to micro-level verse insights
**After:** Full verse-by-verse commentary with lexical insights, figurative analysis, and thematic threads now available

---

## Issue 2: Aggressive Research Bundle Truncation

### Problem
Research bundle was being truncated to preserve tokens:
- **Introduction prompt:** Truncated to 50,000 characters
- **Verse commentary prompt:** Truncated to 100,000 characters
- **Full research bundle:** 207,486 bytes (~172K characters)

This meant the synthesizer was missing:
- Most concordance searches (showing where Hebrew terms appear elsewhere)
- All traditional commentaries (Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Radak, Malbim, etc.)
- All scholarly context (RAG documents)
- Most lexicon entries

**Evidence from debug logs:**
```
[Research bundle truncated for token limits...]
```
Appeared at line 200 (intro) and line 388 (verse) - cutting off mid-lexicon entry.

### Root Cause
Conservative token budgeting from earlier development, not updated when using Claude Sonnet 4.5 with 200K context window.

### Fix
Removed ALL truncation in [synthesis_writer.py](synthesis_writer.py):

**Introduction generation (line 377-379):**
```python
# No truncation needed - Claude Sonnet 4.5 has 200K context window
# Full research bundle is ~50K tokens, well within limits
research_text = research_bundle
```

**Verse commentary generation (line 446-448):**
```python
# No truncation needed - Claude Sonnet 4.5 has 200K context window
# Full research bundle is ~50K tokens, well within limits
research_text = research_bundle
```

### Token Budget Analysis
For Psalm 20:
- Macro analysis: 9,529 chars (~2,400 tokens)
- Micro analysis: 5,903 chars (~1,500 tokens)
- Research bundle: 172,093 chars (~43,000 tokens)
- Prompt scaffolding: ~5,000 tokens
- **Total input:** ~52,000 tokens
- **Output allowance:** 16,000 tokens
- **Grand total:** ~68,000 tokens << 200,000 limit ✓

### Impact
**Before:** Synthesizer only had access to:
- ~20-30 partial lexicon entries
- NO concordance data
- NO traditional commentaries
- NO scholarly context

**After:** Synthesizer has FULL access to:
- 73 complete lexicon entries
- 137 concordance references
- 22 traditional commentary excerpts (Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Radak, Malbim, Meiri)
- Scholarly context from RAG documents
- Complete figurative language analysis

## Verification

Tested on Psalm 20 by running:
```bash
python src/agents/synthesis_writer.py \
  --macro output/test_psalm_20/psalm_020_macro.json \
  --micro output/test_psalm_20/psalm_020_micro_v2.json \
  --research output/test_psalm_20/psalm_020_research_v2.md \
  --output-dir output/test_psalm_20_fixed
```

**Debug log inspection:**
- `output/debug/intro_prompt_psalm_20.txt` now shows:
  - Lines 30-81: Full micro discoveries (10 verses + thematic threads + synthesis notes)
  - Lines 83+: Complete research bundle (no truncation notice)

---

## Expected Quality Improvements

With these fixes, the synthesized commentary should now:

1. **Better intertextuality:** Can cite where Hebrew terms appear elsewhere in Scripture (concordance data available)
2. **Traditional interpretation:** Can engage with Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Radak, and other classical commentators
3. **Verse-specific micro insights:** Can reference the curiosity-driven verse analysis from MicroAnalyst
4. **Fuller lexical context:** Access to complete BDB entries, not just fragments
5. **Thematic coherence:** Can reference cross-verse thematic threads identified by MicroAnalyst

---

## Files Modified
- `src/agents/synthesis_writer.py`
  - Lines 518-555: Enhanced `_format_micro_for_prompt()` method
  - Line 377-379: Removed truncation from introduction generation
  - Line 446-448: Removed truncation from verse commentary generation

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Testing & Validation)
1. ✅ Re-run synthesis on Psalm 20 - **Introduction complete and validated!**
   - Shows concordance citations (Gen 22:12, Exod 18:11, Judg 17:13)
   - Quotes traditional commentaries (Radak, Ibn Ezra, Rashi)
   - Integrates micro discoveries seamlessly
2. ⏳ Complete verse commentary for Psalm 20 (waiting for rate limit reset)
3. Compare old vs new output quality side-by-side
4. Optional: Re-run Psalm 29 with fixed pipeline for additional validation

### Production (All 150 Psalms)

**RECOMMENDED: Use Message Batches API**
- **Why:** 50% cost savings + no rate limits
- **Cost:** ~$5.25 (vs $10.50 standard API)
- **Time:** 24 hours async processing (vs 10+ hours with delays)
- **How:** Submit all 300 requests (150 intros + 150 verses) in one batch
- **See:** `docs/BATCH_API_GUIDE.md` for implementation details

**Rate Limit Issue with Standard API:**
- Each synthesis uses ~50K tokens input (exceeds 30K/min limit)
- Would require 2+ minute delays between every call
- Total time for 150 psalms: 10+ hours of runtime + manual monitoring
- Not practical for production at this scale
