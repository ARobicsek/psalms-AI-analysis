# Psalm 1 in Jewish Liturgy

Psalm 1 is recited in its entirety during the evening service (Maariv) of Yom Kippur, appearing as an introductory supplement within two distinct liturgical contexts across different traditions. In the Edot HaMizrach rite, Psalm 1 is recited as the opening of a devotional sequence that includes Psalms 2, 3, and 24, preceding the formal conclusion of the Yom Kippur Maariv service, which culminates in the Aleinu prayer and the Full Kaddish. Similarly, among communities maintaining the Shir HaYichud and Anim Zemirot tradition, Psalm 1 appears as part of an introductory psalmodic block recited on Yom Kippur night, often before or after the formal Maariv service, followed by the complete Shir HaYichud (Song of Unity) for all seven days of the week. The placement of Psalm 1 at the threshold of these High Holiday devotions is thematically significant, as the psalm's opening contrast between the righteous and the wicked ("Blessed is the one who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked") establishes the spiritual framework for the penitential and self-examination characteristic of Yom Kippur. This usage appears primarily in Ashkenazic and Edot HaMizrach traditions, reflecting regional liturgical variations in the structuring of the Yom Kippur evening service.

# Liturgical Usage of Psalm 1:3

The verse from Psalm 1:3 appears in Jewish liturgy primarily within the festive contexts of the Shalosh Regalim (Three Pilgrimage Festivals) and Rosh Hashanah, particularly in the Edot HaMizrach (Eastern/Sephardic) tradition. In the Mussaf Amidah for the pilgrimage festivals, the phrase is integrated into a broader liturgical composition that emphasizes blessing and divine favor, where the liturgy declares: "שָֽׁנָה זוֹ תִּהְיֶה שְׁנַת זִמְרָה, וְ֭לַיְלָה כַּיּ֣וֹם יָאִ֑יר כַּ֝חֲשֵׁיכָ֗ה כָּאוֹרָֽה. שָֽׁנָה זוֹ תִּהְיֶה שְׁנַת חֲנִינָה" (This year shall be a year of song; night shall shine like day; this year shall be a year of grace). More prominently, the complete verse appears in the Rosh Hashanah night Kiddush ceremony within the Machzor, where it is cited as scriptural support for petitions of divine blessing and success: "אָנָּא יְהֹוָה הוֹשִׁיעָה נָּא, אָנָּא יְהֹוָה הַצְלִיחָה נָא... וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי מָיִם, אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ וְעָלֵהוּ לֹא־יִבּוֹל, וְכֹל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ" (Please, O Lord, save us; please, O Lord, grant us success... and it shall be like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaves do not wither, and whatever it does shall prosper). The imagery of the flourishing tree planted by water serves as a powerful metaphor for blessing and fruitfulness, making it particularly apt for the Rosh Hashanah season when the Jewish people petition for a year of divine favor and successful endeavors. This usage underscores the verse's function in Jewish liturgy as a scriptural anchor for blessings of prosperity and sustained divine providence.

# Scholarly Narrative

The phrase כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם (like a tree planted by streams of water) from Psalm 1:3 appears in Jewish liturgy exclusively within the Tefillat Geshem (Prayer for Rain), the special piyyutim recited during the Chazzan's repetition of the Mussaf Amidah on Shemini Atzeret in both Ashkenazi and Sefardi traditions. This acrostic poem, which begins with the invocation אֱלהֵינוּ וֵאלהֵי אֲבותֵינוּ (Our God and God of our ancestors), integrates the Psalmist's imagery of flourishing vegetation sustained by abundant water into a petition for seasonal rainfall. The liturgy incorporates the phrase within a broader meditation on divine blessing: זְכור אָב נִמְשַׁךְ אַחֲרֶיךָ כַּמַּיִם. בֵּרַכְתּו כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל פַּלְגֵי מַיִם. גְּנַנְתּו הִצַּלְתּוֹ מֵאֵשׁ וּמִמַּיִם (Remember the father drawn after you like water. You blessed him like a tree planted by streams of water. You protected him, saved him from fire and from water). The placement of this phrase within the second blessing (Gevurot) of the Amidah, immediately before the seasonal insertion of Mashiv HaRuach U'Morid HaGeshem, creates a thematic resonance between the Psalmist's vision of botanical prosperity and the community's urgent need for winter precipitation. This liturgical deployment demonstrates how the Rabbis appropriated biblical imagery of flourishing to frame the prayer for rain as both a natural necessity and a sign of divine blessing.

# Scholarly Commentary: Psalm 1:1 in Simchat Torah Liturgy

The phrase בַּעֲצַת רְשָׁעִים (in the counsel of the wicked) from Psalm 1:1 appears in the Sefard liturgical tradition during the Hakafot (circuits) on Simchat Torah, observed during both the evening and morning services of Shemini Atzeret. Rather than appearing as a full recitation of the psalm itself, this phrase is woven into a petitionary prayer within the Torah service, where it functions as part of a broader request for spiritual protection and righteous conduct. The liturgy incorporates the phrase within a supplication that reads: וּתְזַכֵּנוּ שֶׁלֹּא נֵלֵךְ בַּעֲצַת רְשָׁעִים, וְלֹא נִהְיֶה מֵהוֹלְכֵי רָכִיל (and merit us that we shall not walk in the counsel of the wicked, and shall not be among those who bear tales). This integration reflects the liturgical strategy of drawing upon scriptural language to reinforce ethical and spiritual aspirations at a moment of particular joy and communal celebration surrounding the completion and renewal of the Torah cycle. The phrase's inclusion in the Hakafot demonstrates how the Sefard tradition employs biblical vocabulary to frame petitions for divine guidance during one of the most festive occasions in the Jewish calendar.

# Scholarly Commentary: Psalm 1:3 in Jewish Liturgy

The phrase from Psalm 1:3 describing the righteous person as "a tree planted by streams of water" (וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל־פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם) appears in the Sefard liturgical tradition during the Hakafot (circuits) of Simchat Torah, both in the evening and morning services. Within this joyous celebration of Torah on Shemini Atzeret, the phrase is integrated into the Torah Service as part of the liturgical sequence accompanying the seven circuits around the bimah. The liturgy presents the phrase in an extended context that emphasizes moral virtue and divine blessing: "סוּר מֵרָע וַעֲשֵׂה טוֹב, בַּקֵּשׁ שָׁלוֹם וְרָדְפֵהוּ. וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל פַּלְגֵי מַיִם אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ וְעָלֵהוּ לֹא יִבֹּל וְכָל אֲשֶׁר יַעֲשֶׂה יַצְלִיחַ" ("Turn from evil and do good, seek peace and pursue it. And it shall be like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither; whatever it does shall prosper"). This incorporation of Psalm 1:3 during the Hakafot liturgy serves to connect the celebration of Torah with the ethical and spiritual flourishing promised to those who meditate upon God's law, reinforcing the theological message that dedication to Torah study produces abundant spiritual fruit. The phrase thus functions as an interpretive lens through which the community understands its relationship to the Torah being celebrated.

Summary:

# Scholarly Commentary

The phrase וּבְמוֹשַׁב לֵצִים לֹא from Psalm 1:1 appears in Jewish liturgy specifically within the study of Pirkei Avot (the Ethics of the Fathers), which is recited on Shabbat afternoons following the Mincha service in the Sefard tradition, particularly during the weeks between Passover and Shavuot. The Mishnaic passage invokes this biblical phrase to establish a fundamental principle regarding the sanctity of Torah study and the company one keeps, stating: "שֶׁיּוֹשְׁבִין וְאֵין בֵּינֵיהֶם דִּבְרֵי תוֹרָה, הֲרֵי זֶה מוֹשַׁב לֵצִים, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: וּבְמוֹשַׁב לֵצִים לֹא יָשָׁב" (when people sit together without words of Torah between them, behold this is a seat of scoffers, as it is said: "in the seat of scoffers he did not sit"). The quotation demonstrates how the Sages of the Mishnah directly apply the Psalmist's warning against the company of mockers to their own ethical teaching, transforming the biblical verse into a proof-text for the obligation to engage in substantive Torah discourse. This liturgical integration of Psalm 1:1 within Pirkei Avot serves a pedagogical function during the leisurely Shabbat afternoon hours, reinforcing the rabbinic ideal that the righteous distinguish themselves through their commitment to Torah study and the avoidance of frivolous or scornful society.

# Scholarly Narrative

The phrase וְֽהָיָ֗ה כְּעֵץ֮ שָׁת֢וּל עַֽל־פַּלְגֵ֫י־מָ֥יִם ("and he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water") from Psalm 1:3 appears in the Siddur Edot HaMizrach as a scriptural prooftext supporting the study and recitation of Pirkei Avot on Shabbat afternoons following the Mincha service. The phrase is cited within a Mishnaic passage describing the righteous person who studies Torah, integrating the Psalmist's agricultural metaphor as biblical corroboration for the spiritual flourishing that comes through devoted learning. The liturgy presents the extended context: "כָּל־הָרוּחוֹת שֶׁבָּעוֹלָם בָּאוֹת וְנוֹשְׁבוֹת בּוֹ, אֵין מְזִיזִין אוֹתוֹ מִמְּקוֹמוֹ, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: וְֽהָיָ֗ה כְּעֵץ֮ שָׁת֢וּל עַֽל־פַּלְגֵ֫י מָ֥יִם, וְעַל יוּבַל יְשַׁלַּח שָֽׁרָשָׁיו" ("All the winds of the world come and blow upon him, yet they cannot move him from his place, as it is said: 'And he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water, by a stream he sends forth his roots'"). This usage appears specifically during the weeks between Passover and Shavuot, when the custom of studying one chapter of Pirkei Avot per Shabbat afternoon is observed, making the phrase part of the supplemental study material that enriches the Shabbat afternoon liturgy in the Mizrahi tradition.
