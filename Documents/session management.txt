Beginning

 Read CLAUDE.md to get up to speed on the project.

  Current task: [describe what you want to work on]

  Important reminders:
  - Follow file organization rules in CLAUDE.md
  - Don't create new .md files unless absolutely necessary
  - Archive test scripts to archive/debugging/ after use
  - Update docs/session_tracking/PROJECT_STATUS.md with any major changes
  - If significant work is done, update the "Recent Major Changes" section in CLAUDE.md

  ---

  If you're continuing specific work, add:
  Continuing from Session [X]: [brief description]
  See docs/session_tracking/PROJECT_STATUS.md for recent changes

  Or if you're starting something new:
  New task: [description]
  Check archive/debugging/ for similar past work




End
