Beginning

Continuing Psalms project. Please read:
1. @NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md (session handoff)
2. @PROJECT_STATUS.md (current task)
Note that during this work, you should make session updates to these documents and @IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md and NOT create separate session documents.

What should I work on next?


End

Session complete! Please update these 3 files:
1. NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md - Add summary of what we accomplished today
2. PROJECT_STATUS.md - Check off completed tasks, update progress
3. IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md - Add detailed session entry

Then commit.




Then prepare a git commit message summarizing the changes.
