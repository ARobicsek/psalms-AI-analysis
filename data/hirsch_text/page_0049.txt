     1→moment in the form of the misfortune that has befallen David in accordance
     2→with the advance warning given him (Sam. II, 12:9—12). Therefore, in the
     3→opinion of the people, no more help could be found for David from the God of
     4→justice. But the expression וגמ was extended to יתעושיב, in order to impress the
     5→fact that to David the help of God means his יתעושי, his "salvation." However,
     6→הוהי and םיהלא are two irreconcilable opposing concepts. Certainly no
     7→criminal can hope to receive help from the Judge who at that same moment
     8→is executing the judgment upon him.
     9→עיג is a word that often occurs in the psalms, but its meaning is
    10→obscure. The usual assumption that it is synonymous with הלס, "forever," does
    11→ever," does not seem to fit everywhere, since it often occurs both with respect to
    12→events that occurred in the past. Thus עיג ימיעב דירמד (Ps. 48:8); םנקזאעו
    13→עיג ובד (Ps. 77:6), עיג תורוצב (Ps. 77:6), עיג יבד קחב (Ps. 81:12); also עיג ןועיג
    14→(Ps. 9:6). "the eternally desolate," עיג דע עבשנ (Ps. 132:14), עיג דע קדצ רויצ
    15→13 : עלא ועג לא דיע (Ps. If we compare all the places in which the word
    16→עיג occurs, then it would seem to be an expression having the same meaning
    17→as עבש, "satiated, saturated," and ילד, "wearied, exhausted." Thus, a single dash
    18→at the end of a sentence, a dash indicates a recapitulation of the thought,
    19→telling the reader to meditate once more upon that which has just been said,
    20→and to digest it in mind and heart so as to absorb it fully.
    21→Etymologically, according to םיעג ,םיארש, it would be ןב, derived
    22→from ןבא with רעג if like עג ןהק (Gen. 14:10), "unto the mountain"; יב ערו
    23→ערזב רהצנ עיג (Esth. 1:5), "into the court of the garden"; from יכב, "within," to correspond
    24→to ןבא. Now ןב means "a basket," derived from ןבא, "to raise on high," and, as
    25→we have said in our commentary to Exodus 29:3, the exact depth of the
    26→basket, upon which such great emphasis was placed, was to be exactly so
    27→carried. Thus the literal translation of עיג would be "to the basket," "into
    28→the basket," and perhaps we would not be too far from correct if we would
    29→interpret עיג as meaning that the thought that has just been expressed, or has
    30→first take this, collect this first in your mind:. That which has just been said
    31→is worthy of being retained, of being meditated upon, of being "carried away"
    32→and "preserved," so to speak, "for the road," a thought on the way, as the
    33→language expresses it by a Gedankenstrach.
    34→V. 4. ה אירוא. "Even though Thou earnest Thy sovereignty over
    35→me at this very moment as a Judge; יח, Thou wilt still remain to me. Thy
    36→judgment is only a form of mercy that will lead me back from error and sin.
