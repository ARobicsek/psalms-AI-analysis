     1→we can achieve in the faithful service of God. ביראה, thus, the גילו growing
     2→from עבדו and borne by יראה is the greatest bliss of which a creature gifted
     3→with intelligence can be capable before his Creator, that a human being can
     4→feel before his God. נשקו בר in Verse 12 stands in contrast to התיצבו ימלכים at the end of
     5→Verse 2, and both expressions form, so to speak, the brackets of the psalm.
     6→V. 12. נשקו בר. נשקו בר, judging by the accents, is a
     7→continuous sentence structure. בר is not a threat of what will happen to
     8→the enemies but an indication of the precaution to be taken. The continuation
     9→פן יאנף, it denotes that from which they will be spared if they comply with the
    10→charge of נשקו בר. In order to escape God's wrath and the forfeiture of your goal
    11→in life, submit yourselves! The word בר is used in the Bible for both the
    12→pure and impure טהור (Ex. 74:5). נשקו, the imperative form of the Kal inflection,
    13→is spelled here, by way of exception, with a Pathach rather than with a Chorek,
    14→as it is commonly spelled in דברו בר (Is. 63:1; Prov. 12:17, in Verse 2:3 above
    15→74:7), and thus בר, derived from ברר, "that which is pure," such as תורת ה׳ ברה
    16→בטהרה (Job 11:4), ברה אימרת ה׳ (Ps. 19:9), or the noun "Purity" such as אך טוב
    17→לישראל אלהים לברי לבב (Ps. 73:1).
    18→"You must gird yourselves with all that is morally pure, and not with
    19→wrong and violence, if you wish to avert the danger (Verse 5) that His wrath
    20→will be aroused, כי יבער כמעט אפו for kindled is His wrath, by the slightest degree.
    21→Do not tarry before you repent, בר, נשקו בר, for you cannot know how soon
    22→this judgment might smite you."
    23→V. 13. The last verse is a description of whose groups, in a manner paralleling
    24→the description of the fate of individuals, as shown in Chapter 1:6. For
    25→nations and individuals alike, salvation—or may forpass it all, for their master
    26→and ruler is the Lord and King—depends entirely upon the readiness
    27→in accordance with the goal of His sovereign rule. It is said for the individual
    28→אשרי האיש, that the path of the רשעים leads to destruction, the ways of
    29→the Lord are טוב, and שמרם is אשרי. Similarly, here, it is said: blessed are
    30→by new and pure paths, that bright goal of a life on earth which blossoms
    31→under God. Of the nations basing themselves on wrong and violence, however,
    32→it is said that no lasting success or progress will have been able to rescue from
    33→annihilation from the earth, just as many similar nations have already come
    34→to vanish entirely from the stage of history.
