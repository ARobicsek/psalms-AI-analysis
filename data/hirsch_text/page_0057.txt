     2→שם ויוכל ל הבין הבא (Isaiah 54:17); דברים שירים מקרב (Job. 27:11); דגמים
     3→שינתים מעם לברוא (Job 31:2). Thus שרתה means an effort to attain
     4→by means of God, through Him, by virtue of His doxology—so his ideas, 'al raash
     5→'al chesed 'al taanug. In His beings—his main spiritual, inner victory with regard
     6→to that destiny awaiting us, here on earth, in accordance with the direction
     7→our lives have taken. "O! Him Who helps us attain victory to our achieve-
     8→ment," is our prayer.

    10→דברי פי. These are those thoughts that have already become clear
    11→enough to be expressed in words. ויוצר is thinking that is still in the emotive
    12→for stage. מעון is the formulated statement, דבר is that which I reflect upon in
    13→silence. הגיגו, מח is the ear, and הגיג is a scale, כנ is "to weigh, to
    14→ponder." Thus עיר are the two scales for the examining and critical weighing
    15→of the thoughts, the inner דברים, of our hearts. דבר is the raised scale, מת
    16→לב is the fathoming of that which lies deep down below the surface. The לבב

    22→But this focuses the attention awakened by the sounds penetrating the
    23→ear, anxiety to hear more, hearkening. Used in the Kal form it refers to the
    24→activity of the ear; השמיע תפלה קולי שמי (Isaiah 32:3); its Hiphil form is
    25→connected with speech and listening and the result of a yearning to hear more,

    29→Thus David says: שמעה שמעתי התפלל הגיוני. He "hears" both in his
    30→speech, his thinking and in his prayers. The Lord is his "King" and his
    31→"God." It is He that determines his position in life; it is to Him that all of
