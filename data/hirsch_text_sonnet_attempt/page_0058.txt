     1→judicial reasoning. Ver. |ε., through the discernment of all that is good and
     2→true, "and it is up to Thee that, reasoning, I seek to rise" (See Comm. to
     3→Chap. 3:5).

     5→V. 4. כה יום. The word יום כה is used in the first part of this verse
     6→is intended to denote a time of day, the actual morning that recurs daily. The
     7→second time the word יום occurs, it is meant to indicate the dawning of a new
     8→era of good fortune for him, to whom the morning is now only a time of
     9→gloomy present, besieged by error and trouble, the end of that long night in
    10→the evolution of the world. Hence a period of disaster is always seen in the
    11→guise of "evening" or "night." But more particularly, when the night hour is
    12→simile of the "mourning" or the "dawn". But, allegorically, the clear signifi-
    13→cance of יום is a "time of distinguishing" as opposed to דרך and לילה, the
    14→times of spiritual gloom and disorder (See commentary to Gen. 1:3-5;
    15→1:5), will become apparent when we think how difficult it often in nowadays
    16→at a cursory glance to distinguish between the honest man and his false
    17→counterpart, between what is genuinely good and that which is evil. Conse-
    18→quently good men must suffer. יצי, however, is that long-awaited dawn at
    19→which God's justice will even out the final and fitting fate to the righteous and
    20→the wicked, when a clear beam of light will fall on all things, and will show
    21→the distinction between the two. Thus it is said יום נזיי רשע זרר (Isaiah
    22→21:12), אדם הלילות בין ולהבדיל יום אל ולנצח (Ps. 90:14); זרע יום יקדים רננו
    23→קדמתיך (Ps. 119:147). It is the hour, when David, the man of
    24→David (III Sam. 23:1), speaks of the time at which righteousness and the fear
    25→of God shall reign supreme among men, as the "brightly dawning, cloudless
    26→morning". יום is a time of critical weighing, the actual morning is the dawn that
    27→has apportioned to be the herald of this new dawn.

    29→עד לי 'כ "in reference" wherefore, to put something long in proper place
    30→and at the proper time (See Comm. to Chap. 5:4), it means "to present"
    31→an idea in the proper manner, to portray it so as to make it clearly under-
    32→stood. שתות הציגו לפניו (Ps. 50:21); בו תציגו (Prov. 16:1); the orderly
    33→arrangement of words. עד ל therefore is to place a thing or to set it up with an
    34→End, for a thing or a concept, the proper place due to it in accordance with its
    35→value and significance. — עד ל and —ל 'כ means "to" down as appropri-
    36→ate for a thing and equal in significance —ל controlling else", יום ציג לכ (Ps.
    37→40:6), כנגד עד ל ונצב זה (Ps. 89:6).
