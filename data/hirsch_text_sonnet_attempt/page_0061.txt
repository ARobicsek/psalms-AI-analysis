     1→dwell among us even now, in these dark days. In this His House, the Abode
     2→of His Law is the actual 'Sanctuary', the Holy of Holies. The altar and the
     3→candelabrum in the 'Hechal,' in the Abode of His might, set before the
     4→Holy of Holies, the Abode of His Word, teach us to devote all our physical
     5→and spiritual faculties to His service (vide Commentary to Ex. 27:20).
     6→"Thus, when the night, created by evil men, surrounds me and the scheming
     7→and the influence of an מענה מטעי רעו threatens me, then I shall take refuge
     8→in Thy Law, as revealed to me in Thy Sanctuary and I shall remain faithful.
     9→There, filled with awe of Thee, I shall prostrate myself before the ideal Thy
    10→'Hechal' sets for me. I shall consecrate myself to the Sanctuary of Thy Law,
    11→and, in this mood, devote my life to the most faithful possible fulfillment
    12→of these tasks. (וטהעתח, this complete prostration expresses unconditional
    13→devotion), and all my prayer shall be as follows:—
    14→
    15→V. 9. O Lord, help me to the attainment of Thy רטדך. "Lead me in Thy
    16→righteousness; i.e., in the task taught us by Thee in Thy House and in the
    17→Sanctuary of Thy Law. תהנ. Help me so that I may recognize the right path
    18→where it may be obscured before me, נחני. And lead me safe through it."
    19→(See Commentary to Gen. 49:22). From this we derive תוריח (Ps. 92:12)
    20→and, more commonly, תטריע, which has a connotation of hostility, those
    21→who try to put obstacles in my path. תקרע (Num. 10:35; Ps. 27:11) are those,
    22→in another person. "The enmity of my opponents," says David, "serves only
    23→to make me all the more anxious to keep my life pure lest I become guilty of
    24→deserving such enmity. כי יוהיר יטע באב פיתים יטע וטבע כרכטח. Therefore
    25→because of them who lie in wait for me. רטע ליפני וארך, make Thy way lie
    26→straight before me—do not let me remain in doubt for long as to the correct
    27→conduct in any sphere of my life. רטע is the course of Divine guidance, this
    28→is the phrase טטע יוארט יוהיקטי (Prov. 4:25). It is, however וטע רטע and
    29→טטרתי רטע. It is written יוטר, which is a Hiphil form like טרה. It is read with
    30→the vowel formation as if it were a Kal form, therefore spelled יוטר. (Cf. Ps.
    31→8:17), even though the word is actually written טהע. There we have seen
    32→how, in the form טהע the action of the one who is going out recedes into
    33→the background, and instead the purpose of his going out, the message which
    34→he carries, the going out. In thus means "to lead out". In the form טרטת,
    35→however, the action of the one who is going out comes to the fore, indepen-
    36→dently, and the other person does not have to take the trouble to permit him-
    37→self to be taken, someone to go out. In this sense we have a similar situation.
