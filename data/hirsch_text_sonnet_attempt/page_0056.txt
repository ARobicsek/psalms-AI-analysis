     1→9) In peace, at one with all, I
     2→will lay me down and sleep; for
     3→Thou ה' alone makes me dwell in a place
     4→of safety and of peace.

    12→V. 9. ינבלב וחי etc.יחן. If the word רונ is intended here in its usual
    13→meaning of a string of several persons, then it probably means: "Even though
    14→I am stripped of all power, with none of my people left to guard me, my
    15→people, I still lie down and sleep as if I were in the midst of peace and
    16→security and," חטב יכ, "indeed, to sleep in peace", i. e. at peace with everyone,
    17→without the least enmity in my heart. But if I can is merely an inter-
    18→jection expressing complete unconcern, the second
    19→meaning of רדח, the finest unconcern, occurring once in 55:30 as peace and
    20→full safety immediately, without a care or worry." However, since this second
    21→meaning occurs only very rarely, the first interpretation would seem to be the
    22→preferable.
    23→
    24→רדב is not "seclusion", as if surrounded by a wall, so that no harm can
    25→come to me. רדב, from רדב is "full of confidence", without fear. ךידב is utter
    26→security; in this אדובב רדב (Isaiah 47:8, רדב אד), ומב לב דדב יב ומב
    27→רדב (Deut. 33:28). The word ינכשות expresses a concept far more compre-
    28→hensive than the idea of mere rest at night during sleep. ןכש denotes the
    29→settling down to establish a "permanent residence", thereby indicating a
    30→prepare for an a situation, a destiny that will bring me security and peace.
    31→Since the רונ ךינפ יחב has provided, the מענ under ינבלב does not have
    32→to be feared by those who trust in God's שמ and compare this ending
    33→with Verses 6, 7 of the preceding chapter.

    37→V. 1. תוליחנה לע. וחי denotes not only the receipt of an inheritance,
    38→or the permanent acquisition of landed property, but also the maintenance of
    39→continuity and the passing on of such property from generation to generation
    40→(Psalm 119:111), and רונב םמשמ הלח (Prov. 14:18). It is often used with
    41→reference to the fate, good or bad, which God assigns to the righteous and to
    42→the wicked in the world and even in לב, such as הלחת םכשפנ לא (Isaiah 54:17)
