development or activity of a human being or of an object. ‘The verses
- immediately preceding Verse 6 spoke of the sad experiences that Israel
had to undergo during the days before the advent of David, and thus the
thought of Verse 6 would be as follows: “Even so, from time to time during
those dark days of the past, Thow hast raised high the banner of those that
‏ש‎ have been taught to fear Thee by those men whom Thou hadst appointed
as ‘saving’ judges for Thy people. This igh banner is to show us the
height to which we must rise, challenged by the power and might of the
‏ש‎ demands upon our moral character and our way of life as symbolized by
this banner.” It has been our experience throughout our history that, when-
ever the nation, influenced by godly men, returned to the path prescribed by
duty to God and His Law, Israet would also find political deliverance from
‏ש‎ the hostile neighboring states. On the other band, whenever Israel has
Toosened its bonds of loyalty and flagged in its adherence to the path of
duty, it would find itself shackled once more by political defeat and slavery.
Vv Bach one of these experiences was a ‏להתנומס‎ 03, a “banner” calling upon
Israel to rise to its height, symbolizing the fact that the only way in which
Israel could attain permanent political independence and freedom would
‏ש‎ be by wu, “adorning” or shaping every aspect of its life, both material and
spiritual, so as to be in confomity with the goal set by God. Indeed, it is
even possible that ‏להתגוסס‎ might mean “to rise up as a bamer” and the
‏ש‎ meaning of Verse 6 would then be, “By means of the deliverance wo have
experienced from time to time, Thou hast given a banner to those that fear
— Thee, so that each one of them, inspired by his newly gained awareness
of the moral requirements of Iife’s truth, might himself rise to be a banner
-- —an influential examplo—in his own community.” ‏מתנוססות‎ in Zechariah
