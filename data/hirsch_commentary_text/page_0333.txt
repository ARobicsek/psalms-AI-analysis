work of the Lord that He, as ‏,אלהי ישראל‎ wishes to bring to final fruition
amidst mankind for and through the people of Israel, This pious wish not
only very aptly follows the thought expressed in Verse 13 concerning the
3 spititual slgnificancé of David's mission on earth, but also provides a most
fitting conclusion for the first book of the psalms with the songs of David
which are to render such monumental service in aiding Israel to attain the
spiritual goal that has been set for it. ‏העולם :מהעולם ועד העולם‎ derived from
bby, “to be hidden,” is commonly used to denote all the unforeseeable future
v that is still concealed from the view of man; in other words, eternity. But in
this context, it must also denote all the past that has been hidden from our
eye; that is, “from all the days past throughout all times to come.” To
‏שי‎ translate this phrase as “from etemity to eternity” would give no sense,
since there can only be one “eternity” (see Commentary to Gert. 21:33).
