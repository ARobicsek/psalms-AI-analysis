‘Therefore pure ‘ton is sufficient for the beast, and thus if beasts were the
earth’s sole inhabitants, there would be no need for ‏.משמטי ה'‎ However,
earth must also provide a basis for ‏אדם ובהמה‎ Man, unlike the beast, does
5, have the chance to deviate from God’s Law and thus is ia need of disciplice.
- The earth must supply him with a foundation from which he, too, may
reach his Divinely-ordained destiny. Therefore, in order best to serve also
the welfare of man, God must modify His 70M to ‏,צדקה‎ and, in addition
to ‏וצדקה‎ which grants favors, the ‏ה'‎ upwn, which at times deny man’s de-

‎sires and limit his aspirations, must come into play.‏ שי
‎(Psalm 19:2), so trees and‏ השמים מספרים כבוד אל ‎As in‏ ,הררי אל
‎mountains which by their own striking greatness proclaim the omnipotence‏
‎(Psalm 80:11) 5x ‘977, All the great‏ ארני ‎of their Creator, are called bx‏
‎masses of land are mountains rising up from beneath the ocean, mountains‏ 4
‎whose crests form the crassest contrast to the ocean surrounding the con-‏

‏שי‎ V. 8. ‏.מה יקר הסדך‎ How precious, how valued, how significant
and important for the welfare of mankind is the love which God gives it
in His capacity as ‏אלק'‎ the judge of all the deeds of men! This is the
‏ש‎ loving kindness, composed of ‏צדקה‎ and ‏משפט‎ in which God's ‏אמונה‎ His
faithful discipline, shows itself to man. This ‏אמונה‎ is a manifestation of
God’s love, regardiess of whether it takes on the form of np7s, granting or
preserving, or that of pawn, taking and withholding. Therefore it is
Vv expressed so significantly (in Psalm 69:7 ff) by the Tetragrammaton which
is written with the vowels of, and pronounced like ‏.אלקים‎ It is always
--- the same God, always the same loving-kindness, It is actually ‏מדת הרחמים‎
that appears as ‏ובני אדם .מדת הדין‎ the children of men can find faith for their
future only under the wings of this great love which is woven from the
| threads of both ‏עדקה‎ and ‏.משפט‎
