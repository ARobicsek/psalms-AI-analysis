inner and outer life, has foresaken all that is good and pure, and thus ‏יחדיו‎
‎together, as a community, they were ‏,נאלחו‎ “accursed”. The word ‏אלח‎ occurs
in only threo places in the Scriptures; that is, io this Psalm, in Psaim 53:4
5 and in Job 15:16. In accordance with the analogy of ‏גלה‎ (to uncover) and
nba; ‏דלה‎ and ‏כלה ;דלח‎ (complete) and ‏בלה‎ (extreme old age); ‏פלה‎ (to divide}
and nbp, etc., the word ‏אלת‎ is probably closely related to ‏,אלה‎ “curse”, ‘Thus
‏נאלת‎ would mean “to be accursed”. Every individual as such is depraved and
‏שי‎ thus these individuals are a curse one to the other in their lives together.
It is not necessary for God Himself to intervene and to inflict punishment
upon such ₪ society in which everyone of its members serves as the proper
punishment for his fellow-citizens. Ordinarily the seeds of destruction which
Vv become evident as the result of atheistic depravity would serve to bring to
their senses all those still capable of rational thought. It is perhaps with a
great deal of delicacy that the Psalmist here describes the curse upon a
‏שי‎ society by the term derived from and reminding of ‏.אלה‎ The Divine mule and
order in history proclaims itself to every rational human being by the very
fact that human society cannot go on when moral decay is universal; when
each man is the other's curse and is therefore faced with only two choices:
Vv either to perish by his own deeds or else 10 mend his ways.
‘This Psatm reminds us that there have often been periods when
“considered individually, each one is perverted; together, each one the other’s
‏ש‎ curse; there is ‏סת‎ one who does good because of the principles he holds—
none, not one,”
‏.ער‎ 4. Sap ‏.הלא‎ In the midst of such corruption and perversion
there was one community in buman society which God called ony, the
v nation, which had not forgotten Him, which subordinated itself to God and
to His Law in all its individual and social endeavors, and which placed its
destiny entirely into His hands, This people, then, the nation of the Divine
--- Law, which had to bold aloft the standard of God and His Law in the midst
of atheism and world-wide lawlessness, was a nation barred from the uso of
all the ways and devices by which the other penntec enmoht and fannd eall.
