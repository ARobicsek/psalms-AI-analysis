1) A Psalm of David. Ascribe ya mippbagn patio a OD
to the Lord, O you who are en- ** ve ‏אל 3 לה בד‎
dowed with strength, ascribe to STE TDD TIN? ‏הָב‎ Che
the Lord glory and might.

V.9. As we have already noted in the beginning of this Psalm,
‏ב‎ David's trust in the Lord is strengthened because he is aware of his own
exalted position in the midst of the Jewish nation. He knows that the
welfare of his people is closely knit with his own, and that therefore, he,
too, will have a part in the help, guidance and exaltation which is sure to
‏ש‎ come to his people.

foes and tribulations, and which we can derive only from the understanding
of ovr own relationship to the Law of the Lord, that treasure which

has as its purpose to waken within us the feeling of devoted obedience
to God's voice, which speaks to us through the medium of His Law. This
purpose is served in Psalm 29 by a portrayal of the glory and invincibility
‏ש‎ in which both this voice and the Lord Himself, Who speaks to us through
His Law, reveal themselves in both nature and history. It is through this

‘Those who, by their loyal obedience to the voice of His Law, shall
demonstrate that they are indeed members of God's nation shall also
partake of the blessing of that peace which can be found with Him alone, and

Vv nowhere without Him.

those “begotten” by forces of powers, Jt would be unthinkable to compare
God with such earthly forces. Therefore the explanation to the auestion
