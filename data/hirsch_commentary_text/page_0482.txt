PSALM LXVIII
‏ער‎ 1. In this psalm, too, David sings of God's sovereignty as de-
vw monstrated in the history of both Isracl and mankind. Israel's deliverance
from Egypt, its progress through the desert, the giving of the Law at Sinai,
the presence of the Lord in Israel's midst, and, finally, Israel's survival in
‏שי‎ exile are all manifestations of God’s rute. It is through such demonstrations
of God's sovereignty that all the kingdoms on earth shall one day be led to
worship Him.
Vv. 2. "a mp, If God were to rise up in all His might, all the
‏ש‎ wicked on earth would perish immediately, all the conspiracies of the focs
of His Law and order would be scattered, and all those who hate God's
moral Law and would spread this hatred among men, would flee before His
‏ש‎ presence. (See Commentary to Num. 10:25). The Lord, however, employs
other means to bring abont the advent of His kingdom on earth.
V. 3. "mn ‏ונדף) כהנדף‎ related to 402, “to disintegrate into small
‏שי‎ parts”; therefore “to fade”), ‏הנדף‎ is a combination of ‏נדוף ,קל‎ and ‏נטעל‎

is bastened by every blast of wind from without, ‏:הנדף תנדף‎ It fades away
‏שי‎ gradually, and ‏:תנדף‎ Tey usually taking the masculine form, takes the
feminine gender here. “Even as smoke fades away of its own accord and

‏כהמס דונג‎ even as wax cannot abide the presence of fire, so the encmies and
