breadth.” nnna “Thou hast apportioned me my days only in fists’ breadths;
it is Thy decree that the duration of human life be brief” ‏,חלודה ,ותלדי‎ in
Rabbinic literature, denotes “rust.” Therefore ‏חלד‎ is the most suitable de-
‏שי‎ signation for an existence upon which the tooth of decay feeds unceasingly.
‏נגדך‎ “Before Thee, to Whom all eternity belongs, my brief, short-lived
existence fades to nothingness, and yet evea this fleeting life of mine in this
transitory world is a gift from Thee,” ‏נתתה ימל‎ says David. “If, then, I am
4 nothing beyond that which comes within the scope of ‏,חלדי‎ my frailty, which
is ‏כאיך‎ as naught ‏נגדך‎ before Thy etemity, then Thou wouldst really have
given me nothing but a term of ‘non-existence’ from the infinite fullness of
Vv ‘Thy eternity.” ‏אך כל הבל וגו‎ “Should, then, this same man whom Thou
hast placed in ‏סלה‎ 333, in such a bigh position on earth, be nothing but vanity?
Should there really be nothing in his being that will outlast this fists’
‏שי‎ breadth of his existence, nothing that is not vulnerable to the tooth of
decay? Should not the very position which Thou hast assigned man in this
world be a guarantee that his destiny will reach far beyond the ‏טפתות‎ of
his own days and the an of his world?” This was David's question. The

V.7. ‏וגו"‎ qx. That which guides man in his life's way is usually

(Psalm 86:11), ‏יהלכון‎ pap ‏באור‎ (Psalm 89:16), ‏והתהלכתי באמתך‎ (Psalm
— 26:3}, Dona ‏הולכים‎ (Psalm 84:12), ‏ההולכים בתורת ה'‎ (Psalm 119:1),
‏גם בעצתם הלך‎ (Chron. 11 22:5), ‏לא הלך בעצת רשעים‎ (Psalm 1:1). Man
