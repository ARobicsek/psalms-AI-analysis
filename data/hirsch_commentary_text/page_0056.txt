without the [cast animosity in my heart. But if (as it does only in rare cases),
the term 17h? denotes the simultancous occurrence of several activites, such
Vv as ‏יחד‎ HRM ‏אשם‎ Cin 159185 42:14( it would mean; “T lie down in peace and
fall asleep immediately, without a care or worry”. However, since this second
meaning occurs only very rarely, the Grst interpretation would seem to be the
‏שי‎ correct one.
‏לבדד‎ is “set apart”, as if surrounded by a wall, so that no harm can
come near me. nva? is “full of confidence”, without fear. ‏לבדד‎ is outer
security; ‏לבטח‎ is that sccurity which comes from within, Cf. moa ‏וישכן ישראל‎
Vv ‏בדר‎ (Deut, 33:28). The word ‏תושיבני‎ expresses a concept far more compre-
hensive than the idea of mere rest at night during sleep. ‏יטב‎ denotes the
entire quict state in earthly destiny. Whatever may come my way, Thou wilt
‏ש‎ prepare for me a situation, a destiny that will bring me security and peace.
Since the ‏ואישן מס עולה זיורד‎ has preceded, the ‏אתנת‎ under ‏לבדד‎ does not have
the effect of separating the two parts of the sentence. Compare this ending
with Verses 6, 7 of the preceding chapter.

‎PSALM V
V. 1. ‏.אל הנחילות‎  לחנ‎ denotes not only the receipt of an inheritance,
Vv ot the permanent acquisition of landed property, but also the maintenance of
Spiritual values that are to be preserved forever, as it is said ‏נחלתי עדותיך לעולם‎
—_ (Psat 119:111( , and ‏נחלו פתאים אולת‎ (Prov. 14:18). It is often used with
reference to the fate, good or bad, which God assigns to the righteous and to
the wicked as the inheritance which they eared, deriving from the way of
| life each has followed, ‏והחוסה בי ינחל ארץ‎ {Isaiah 57:13), ‏ותמימים ינהלו טוב‎
