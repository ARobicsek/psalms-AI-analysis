5 to ‏,פקדת הארץ‎ etc. In other words, David tells us here: “It was an act of
loving-kindness on Thy part that Thou didst allow the earth to languish.

It was not that Thou wert powerless to give it the needed nourishment.

Thou didst remain abundant for it in exceedingly great abundance” or

‎“Thou didst want to.make it rich,” for “the well of God is always filled‏ שי
‎with water, But Thow preparest their com; that is, man’s corn, by thus‏

‎preparing #; that is, the earth.” If the flourishing and blossoming of the

‎soil were an end in itself, then God would never permit drought to strike or‏ שי
‎crops to fail, and the earth would be in full flower eternally. But the growth‏

‎of the fruit of the soil has as its purpose to advance the moral training of

‎mankind.” The earth should bear ‏",דגנם"‎ “the fruit that is to nourish man.”

‎It is for this reason that earth is “prepared” by means of periodic droughts‏ ש
‎and crop failures so that man should first learn “to fear God” and,‏
‎through this fear of his Maker, make himself worthy of benefitting by the‏

‎blossoming and ripening of earth's fruits.‏ שי

‎‘VY. 11. ‏.תלמיה וגו‎ The meaning of mm here is not quite certain.
‘7a means “to cut in” and ‏גדוד‎ is employed to denote a “divided furrow.”

‎Vv Since ‏נחת‎ means “to lower,” 71 would bave to mean “something that
is cast up,” hence perhaps the soil “cast up” in the plowing opcration, the
“furrows.”

‎Vv ‏.ער‎ 12. wi ‏.עטרת‎ In this context, ‏שנה‎ is not a period of time limited
to any one calendar year, but denotes the beginning of a new era, either in
the good or in the less fortunate sense of the word. Thus we read ‏שנת‎

‎—— wr ‏שלומים לריב‎ (Isaiah 34:8), ‏שנת רצון‎ (ibid. 61:2(  ילואג ‏שנת‎ (ibid. 63:4),
‏שגת פקודתם‎ (Jeremiah 11:23}. ‏מעגליך‎ are the groups, rallying round God,
the “circles” centering around Him.
