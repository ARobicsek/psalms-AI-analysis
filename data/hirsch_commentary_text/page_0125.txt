gated by sensuality, man will yet find his way to God. Man denies the |
existence of God not just because He cannot be perceived by the sense of
‏שי‎ sight and touch and because He can be detected only by reasoning. Reason
can wo longer find God simply because it makes no effort to seek him. ‘The
human mind is not anxious to find God because the very idea of the exist-
ence of such a Supreme Being is most inconvenient to man's physical desires.
Vv In tra, all that man knows or boasts of knowing is actually in the realm of

‏ש‎ Jaws which science seeks to ascertain empirically actually do not belong into
the realm of sensory perception. ‘They are, like God Himself, “invisible”
and have existence and power of persuasion only in the sphere of reason.
If it were as uncomfortable for the human mind to accept the existence of
v certain forces and laws of nature as it is for him to accept such concepts as
“God” aad “God's moral Law”, then the principles of science would be
denied just as emphatically as is God in this world of physical desire.

corruption in the history of mankind. At such periods of depravity God has
always looked down Jong and often from on high to see whether men, by
using whatever uncorrupted, rational reason they might still possess, are not
4 attempting to "506% and find” God.
