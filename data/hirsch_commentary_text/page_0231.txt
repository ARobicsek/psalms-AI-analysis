V. 6 7. ‏.ברוך ה' וגל‎ David feels that his prayer has already been
heard because he has been helped to understand that the attitudes held by

‎his foes toward God and His Law are quite different from those which‏ ש
‎be bas always cherished. David derives renewed confidence from the‏
‎realization that the Lord is on his side and approves of his endeavors.‏

‎‘Therefore David realizes that anyone who harbors hostility against him‏ שי
‎must of necessity also be an enemy af the Lord and the Lord will therefore‏
‎oppose the will of any such foe, David knows, too, that his life and‏
‎his endeavors have a special place within the pattern of principles defended‏

‎Vv and protected by the Lord, and he feels that this realization alone has
already brought him the help for which he has yearned. He is thus inspired
to sing a joyous hymn in praise of God and of the renewed manifestation

‎of His greatness, It is a song such as this, an ovtpouring of trust in God‏ שי
‎in the midst of the direst peril, that pays the perfect tribute to the under-‏
₪ יהודוך ‎standing and the knowledge of the Lord.  ונדוהא for une just as‏
.על כן עמים יהודוך-- -45:18 ‎in Psalm‏ יודוך ‎used instead of‏

‎Vv V. & ‏למר )1 .ה' עז למור‎ were the dative plural form here, as it is
in every other instance, this plural would refer only to the ‏רשעים‎ mentioned
in Verse 3, and the thought of the first part of Verse 8 would be, “The

‎Vv Lord, in His invincibility, is too strong for them, and all the plans they
have laid against me will founder upon His strength.” However, we have

‎_ already noted in connection with Psalm 11:7 that the ending ‏מו‎ in
‏ישר יהזר פנימר‎ seems to be a singular form. Therefore it might be a singular
form here, too, and thus the meaning would be that “The Lord, His is the

‎| power which none can overcome.”
