‘#5 regards that part of your duty, for you punctiliously carry out the letter
of the sacrificial ceremonies.” ‏(שלמים) זבהים‎ and ‏עולות‎ are those offerings
which, unlike navn and owe, are occasioned not by prescribed ritual but are
‏ש‎ brought voluntarily, showing the desire of the worshipper to give some
tangible expression of his relationship to God, “You have not been wanting
as regards such offerings,” the Lord continues, “But what you have failed
to realize sufficiently is that the purpose of these offerings which 1 expect
Vv you to bring is not simply the ceremonial act itself and its execution in
accordance with My precepts. Nor does a mere sacrifice find favor in My
eyes. You must not believe that you have afforded Me pleasure and have
‏שי‎ paid Me the tribute I expect of you by the mere act and execution of the
sactificial ceremony. For if 1 were to take pleasure in the animals slaughtered
upon My akars, even as heathens think that their deities delight in their
animal sactifices, then I would certaialy not need to rely upon your gene-
Vv rosity with your possessions in order to afford Myself such satisfaction. For
everything that lives and breathes in the far-flung reaches of nature is Mine,
* and even all that which man has already fenced off as his own with the
‏ש‎ hedge of his might is Mine as well.”

‎“Tt is true,” says the Lord, “that I have com-‏ .האוכל ‎“ay‏ .13 ער
‎manded you to bring Me offerings of ‘flesh and blood’ upon My altar.”‏
‎(Commentary to Deut. 12:27), “But the purpose of such offerings was never‏
‎to afford Me the scnsual pleasure of devouring flesh and blood. The ‘flesh’‏ ש
‎which you offer up to Me should symbolize the immolation of the strength‏
‎of your own muscles in the fire of My Law in order to work to bring about‏
‎that which will find favor in My cyes. And the ‘blood’ should serve to‏ ———
‎signify the consecration of your spirit so that it may strive upward to the‏

‎high plane at which it will meet with Mv favor.”
