PSALM ‏זוא‎
‎¥.1. ‏.מזמור לדוד‎ This psalm expresses the most intimate relation-
ship of the individual man with God and gives us a strikingly clear insight
‏ש‎ into David's soul. ‏,ה' רועי"‎ the Lord is my shepherd, therefore I suffer no
want. I do not miss what I do not have, I do not feel its lack, since it is
God, my shepherd, Who has seen fit to withhold it from me. He shows me
‏שי‎ His love by denying me that which I desire but which, were 1 to have it,
would cause me harm.”
‏נאות .בנאות וגו" .2 .ער‎ is the plural of ‏נאה‎ as ‏שנות‎ is the plural of ‏.שנה‎
‏נאה‎ is the Chaldean word for “beautiful,” “pleasant”; in Hebrew the word
v is changed by the addition of 2; it then is spelled mai, From this we derive
‏,נאות‎ “pleasant places,” “pastures.” ‏מנוחות‎ is “abundant rest.” “Wherever
He allows me to lie down, there a pleasant pasture shall bloom for me.
‏ש‎ If He summons me to rise up and depart then it is only to reach a more
abundant, wholesome peace and rest than my erstwhile camp could havo
afforded me. Whatever He may decree for me, be it change or rest, is
‏שי‎ intended solely for my welfare.”
V. 3.  בבושי ‏,נפשי‎ “All of God’s ways are intended not only for
my physical well-being, but also for my spiritual and moral welfare,” says
David. “That is the sole goal of any change that the Lord may bring about
Vv in my life. Should rest become harmful to me, then He will cause me unrest
and agitation. Bot if this lack of peace should prove dangerous to my moral
and spiritual welfare, He will grant me rest again.” This concept of variety
—s and change is expressed in the Piel form here, 2210. Generally, the word
anv is used to denote “returning repeatedly or completely to a former state
or condition.”
