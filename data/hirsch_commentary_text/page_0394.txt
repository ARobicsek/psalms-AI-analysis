V. 9 ‏.תחטאני גר‎ The institution of the ‏פרה אדומה‎ is meant to
proclaim this truth conceraing the dual aspect of human nature, the presence
of the unquenchable spark of the divine within the transitory physical husk,

Vv and the possibility for man of a free choice between right and wrong despite
the bonds of sensual desire. The symbol of the ‏פרה אדומה‎ teaches us that
