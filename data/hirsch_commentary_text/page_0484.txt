(259 also means “evening,” see Commentary to Gen. 1:5, Deuteronomy
Vv 1:7). 3, phonetically related to ‏כת‎ and 79, indicates a demonstration of
God's force and power, a manifestation of His rule and His ways; it is part
of the full Name of God. (Sce Commentary to Exod. 15:2, 17:16). The
thought of Verse 5, then, is as follows, “Through the views you hold, and
4 with the aid of the songs you sing in His praise, soar ‏קט‎ to Him Who guides
His world aright; Who, ‘guiding and shaping,’ (as indicated by the use of
the name symbolizing His power), safely leads His world even through
Vv times that seem hopelessly barren. In your hymns of praise, sing forth that
exultation which you can derive solely if you live ‘before His countenance’.”
Vv. 6. ‏-אבי וגל‎ “Sing of ‏.אלקי' במעון קדשו‎ Proctaim that God,
‏שי‎ though, to men, He seems exalted in His unattainable greatness and none
can even approach His majesty, is still the closest friend to men on earth,
the Father and the Defender of the most forsaken of His creatures.” ‏יתום‎ is
telated to oa, used in Rabbinic fiterature to denote someone whose hand
‏ש‎ has been maimed. When the mn’ loses his father, he also loses the “hand”
that was his guide and stay. But God is still his Father. ‏,אלמנה‎ “widow,”
is related to ‏,אלם‎ “to be dumb.” When a woman loses her husband in death,
‏שי‎ she is deprived of the defender who “interceded in her behalf,” But God

still remains her Defender.
