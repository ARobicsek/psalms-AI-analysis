2S, V. 16. ‘10 ‏.טוב מעט‎ In general, one cannot judge the true extent

of a person's fortune by outward appearances, The little that a righteous

man has may be far better than the noisy abundance in which many ‏רשעים‎

delight. pun, derived from ‏המה‎ “to make noise,” is usually employed with

reference to a mob, or a crowd of people. At times, however, it is used
