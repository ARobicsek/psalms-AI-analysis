Tracies into the Heavens. Ahroughout the universe, wherever 106 can be
found, every living thing, even the lowest of creatures, is a product of
God's bountiful love. But His ‘faithfulness’'—His help amidst danger,—both
- physical and spiritual—is manifested only on the earth, within the bounds
of this planct that is surrounded by the clouds of the skies.” (Cf, Psalm 36:6).
‏.רומה גר .12 .ףר‎ See Verse 6. It is significant to note that the
definite article ‏ה‎ that preceded ‏שמים‎ in Verse 6 is missing here, Here
the thought first expressed in Verse 6 is employed as a generalization to
‏ש‎ refer to mankind as a whole. We do not have here ‏על השמים‎ “above the
heavens which are spread out above me now, and beyond which Thou dost
seem very far away at this time,” but ‏;על שמים‎ “At all times and at all
‏שי‎ places, whenever it will appear as if Thou wert far removed from human
affairs and events, the manifestation of Thy presence will still be clearly
appareat over all the earth.”

‎V. 1.  תחשת ‏.אל‎ (Sce Psalm 57). Even though the theme of this
‏שי‎ psalm seems to be applicable to all of mankind, the fact that it is placed
between such chapters as Psalms 57 and 59 would support the theory that
Psalm 58, like those chapters, refers to David's personal sufferings and also
stems from the personal experiences of David. It contains a reproach
Vv directed at those who, by virtue of their high position and station, should
have deemed it their duty to intervene, both in word and in action, to put
an end to the evil done in the Iand but who, instead, have kept complacently
‏שי‎ silent in the face of widespread lawlessness. David feels that, because of
their complacency, they share in the guilt for all the evil that is done within
---- their jurisdiction. If all the good men who condemn evil in their hearts were
to rise up openly against evil both by word and by action, most of the
erimes that have been perpetrated in this world would never have been
| committed.
