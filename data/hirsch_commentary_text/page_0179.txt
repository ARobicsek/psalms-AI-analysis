indicated the relationship between the ‏קומץ המנהה‎ and the ‏קומץ‎ of the ‏תרומת‎

‎in our Commentary to Lev, 6:3. We have therefore interpreted this‏ הדשך

‎part of Verse 4 to be a wish; i. 6. “may He accept (or, stated in a positive

‎(that‏ תרומת הדשן ‎and the‏ מנחות ‎of 811 your‏ אזכרה ‎form: “He accepts”) the‏ ש

‎is the literal meaning of ‏(דשן‎ of your ‏"עולה‎ May the remembrance of all

‎your offerings and of your constant upward striving toward the Lord remain

‎before Him forever (or, positively stated: “this remembrance is ever before‏ שי

‎Him").

‎The form ‏,ידשנה‎ however, is unique in its nature and cannot be de~

‎rived from standard word formations. If the ‏ה‎ at the end of the word

‎Vv were a ‏,נוסף ה'‎ it would have to be preceded by a yop, as in ‏יהישה מעשהו‎

‎(Isaiah 5:19). A similar form occurs in only one other instance in the

‎Scriptures, namely in ‏הראה לך‎ (Samuel 1, 28:15). Since we have no ex-

‎Vv planation whatsoever for cither of these two forms, we believe we may safely

‎presume to understand them as being a combination of two roots; ie.,

‎as a combination of‏ ואקראה ‎and‏ ,שנה ‎and‏ דשן ‎as a combination of‏ ירשנת

‎Judges 9:29), “To free it from its ashes so that it may be repeated” is a

‎thought that would be entirely in accordance with the concept of ‏תרומת הדשן‎

‎as evolved above. It would mean, “The Lord has approved your work,

‎your progress of the day just past, and He will encourage you to carry on‏ ש
‎in the same spirit on every new day.”‏

‎In a similar manner we covld explain the form ‏הראה לך‎ to be ₪

‎combination of the roots ‏קרא‎ and ‏.ראה‎ It would then mean mon ‏ואקרא‎

‎| “I called upon you to appear”; i.e., “I called unto you, ‏'82סספ1'‎ " In that
