sword for a prolonged journey upon an errand entrusted me by Saul,
But instead, you, Doeg, have used your position with Saul and your know!-

have taken this opportunity to do good, and tumed it to evil use. You
employed your tongue for falsehood when you could have used it to plead

V. 6,7, “ur ‏.אהבת‎ yba is a disaster that strikes a person suddenly,
leaving him no time to devise means of saving himself; it is a calamity which
v “devours” him, David tells Doeg, “By your acts against me and Achimelech
before Saul you have shown what a dangerous man you are, You have
proven that you enjoy using your words to bring down disaster upon in-
nocent people, and that, in general, you delight to employ your gift of speech
Vv for fraud and deceit. A person such as you represents much too great
a peril for buman happiness for the Lord to allow him to remain with his evil
influence wherever people dwell, or to permit him to grow and flourish
Vv where men breathe.” ‏נתץ‎ is ordinarily employed to denote a destructive
breaking up of high or highly-placed objects, such as heights, altars, houses,
towers, etc. Therefore it means here, “He will tear (you) down (from)

denote “the removal of fire.” np’ ‏לחתות אש‎ (Isaiah 30:14). “Even after

take you far from the places where men dwell.” yo", ‏נסח‎ is an intensified
| form of ‏,נסע‎ as in ‏ונסחתם מעל האדמה‎ “to take far away” (Deut. 28:63).
