V.8,9. "ul ‏.ותנעש‎ The word ‏געש‎ is used here and in several places
in the Book of Jeremiah to denote a violent agitation. It seems to be pho-
v netically related to the word ‏,כעס‎ and, just like the latter, wya apparently
indicates a violent physical movement. ‏ויתגעשר‎ The earth and the mountains
shook. Since the Force that actually caused the agitation was not visible, it
v appeared as if they were moving and shaking of themselves. Therefore we
read wan, which is the Hithpael form of the verb. What is meant here is:
Whenever the world has appeared to be in a state of violent agitation and
whenever the greatest and strongest physical powers shook to their very
Vv foundations, the cause of this commotion has always been God’s will and
His displeasure at the conduct of men. ‏עשן‎ and wx, the smoke heralding ruin
and the fire bringing destruction in its wake, with which the world was filled,
‏שי‎ were signs of His wrath and part of the execution of a decision that had come
forth from His mouth, ni is any substance converted into embers in which
the fire still glows with its consuming power. ‘That is, everything that is
touched by the finger of destruction has fallen victim to Him and to the fire

V. 10, 11, "ayo, God did intervene in earthly events, ‏וגו"‎ 475,
but men did not see Him, ‏וגו'‎ 239". ‘These events are represented here by
‏ש‎ the figure of the Cherub, upon which He drew nigh to earth, and His presence
moved upon the wings of the stormy breath which swept through the world.
