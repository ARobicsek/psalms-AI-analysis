Him be blessed, And He is blessed indeed. His will is fulfilled in ways that

v are beyond the limited understanding of mere man. For He alone is my
‏,נסלאות.‎ and His ways are not subject to the inferences which man in his
shortsightedness draws from the nature of things as he understands them.

an end.”
