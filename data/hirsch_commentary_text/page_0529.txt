we read also in Yoma 87a ‏-מסא זרזיפי דמיא ארישא‎

V. 7, "i tmp», David hopes that the king of the Jewish nation will
v not be indiscriminate in his work on bebalf of his people. “May justice and
the righteous man in particular flourish in the days of his reign, and an
abundance of peace ‏שלום .עד בלי ירח‎ includes not only peace among men,
‏ש‎ ‘but embraces all the harmonious accord of all conditions, affairs and rela-
tionships. It is not easy to interpret the additional phrase ‏.עד בלי ירח‎ It could
not very well mean “until (we are) without a moon,” i., “forever,” for it
is hardly possible to say “may there be an abundance of peace ‘forever’ ‘in
‏ש‎ his days," since the days to which reference is made here, constitute only a
Timited period of time, and not ctemity. In Isaiah 60:19, 20, we read of
the happy future which we hopefully await. pay ‏לא יהיה לך עוד השמש לאור‎

‏לא יאסף כי ה' יהי' לך לאור עולם ושלמו ימי אבלך‎ J. “The sun will no longer
need to serve to give you daylight, neither shall the moon give you brightness

‏ש‎ your glory. Your sua shall never set again, and your moon shall never with-
draw, for the Lord will be your everlasting light, and the days of your
mourning shall be at an end.” Perhaps, then, here, too, ‏יפרח צדיק ורב שלום‎
‏עד בלי ירה שי‎ would mean, “The righteous man shall flourish so opulently and
the welfare of all shall grow in such abundance that the awareness of God,
en shining through every body and sout, shall tolerate no darkness of night upon.
