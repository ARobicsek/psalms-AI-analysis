tered human lives, but in terms of the building and advancement of human

Vv happiness and prosperity. ‏,ריתי‎ “a man shall five through bim’—that is the

use to which the king will put the gold that shall be brought to him as tribute.

“This poor man who will owe his life and his happiness to the king's bounty

‎shall pray for him and bless him every day.” It is such moral greatness and‏ ש

‎glory that distinguish the rule of this king from that of all the ordinary

‎monarchs on earth. It is such qualities that will earn him the homage of all

‎the world and will result in his becoming arbiter and counselor, friend and

‎Vv helper to princes and nations, and cause his moral influence as a ruler to

‎extend over all the earth, as is indicated in Verses 8—11.

‎V. 16. ‘at nos ‏.יתי‎ God will lavish also material blessings in rich

‏קסע ‎abundance upon such a prince and upon a nation that is led and‏ שי

‎by sovereigns such as he. This material prosperity is mentioned in detail only

‎here, toward the end of the psalm, and is indicated by only one outstanding

‎feature. noo derived from ‏,פסס‎ “to stop,” is “the border” (cf. ‏כתונת טסים‎

‎Vv Commentary to Genesis 36:3).-“May the borders of the grainfields in the

‎land extend to the top of the mountains, may the grainfields end only upon

‎the summits of the hills, In other words, all the land will bear fruit. And

‎this harvest of grain will be so mighty that the fields will rustle like the forests‏ שי

‎of Lebanon. “101 13". But the greatest blessing of them all shall be that men

‎—— shall blossom forth from out of the city like the grass of the fields.” This

‎is the sum total of all of David's hopes for the reign of his son. If his son

‎will fulfill his task as David conceives of it, then the city, the basis of the
