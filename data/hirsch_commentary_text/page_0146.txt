PSALM XVIII
‏ש‎ V. 10 This psalm is a ‏,טירה‎ a song that proclaims the perception
of the hand of God in the course of events (see Commentary to Exod.
15:1). Here it is David who sings of the manifestations of God’s sovereign-
‏שי‎ ty which he has experienced throughout his days on earth. David's life was
filled with trials and sorrows from the time when be was a lone fugitive,
persceuted by his foes, until the period when he reigned as the victorious
leader of his people and as the standard-bearer of its future, This great
v variety of personal experiences has qualified him to become the singer,
for all of mankind, of God's praises for all times to come. This psalm was
set down in II Samuel, Chapter 22, as a part of the story of David. David
‏שי‎ himself made some changes in it when it was finally ‏4פמוט)‎ over to his
people as a kind of national hymn.
‏לעבר ה"‎ is one of the insertions made by David when he revised
‏שי‎ this psalm. David dared call himself an ‏,עבד ה'‎ a servant of the Lord,
only long after Psalm 18 was first written, when he could look back upon
₪ long life of labor in the cause of God. The most outstanding fruits of his
Jabors were, of course, his songs, which he left to his people as a spiritual
‏ש‎ ‘tueasure that was to serve to bring them closer to God through all the days
to come.
‏כף .מכף כל אויביר ומיר שאול‎ is the bent, grasping hand, 7 is the
— hand that is outstretched and moving. His enemies offered themselves
to Sau} as a tool for all his plans against David. David's enemies pursued
him in obedience to Saul’s command.
