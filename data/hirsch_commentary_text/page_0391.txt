judgment.
Exod, 34:6)—may God grant me those favors that would help blot out
my transgressions against Uriah and Bathsheba.”
‏.הדב וגר .4 .ער‎ Every transgression is twofold in nature in that it
v is a sin against one’s fellow-man on one hand, and a violation of 0005 own
inner purity on the other. And unless God should intervene In His onmni-
potent grace, the inevitable consequences of sin, also dual in character,
‏שי‎ become apparent in the disturbance of the sinner’s outward happiness and
in the Joss of bis inner spiritual and ‏[הוסנת‎ purity. (See Commentary to
Leviticus 15:30), The obvious aspect of the crime ‏,עון‎ the “deviation” from
the path of what is right and proper; ‏חטאת‎ denotes the spiritual process that

the shining, purifying and reviving power of the Divine fire. (See Comm.
fo Gen, 39:9). The literal meaning of ‏כבס‎ is “the washing away” of super-

suffering and trouble to such an extent and for such a length of time that
even those about him will concede that he had sufficiently atoned for his sin,
‘Tho word ‏הרב‎ is given emphasis by its spelling, ‏.הרבה‎ What David means
‏ש‎ is ‏,הרבה‎ but what he actually utters is the milder form of ‏,הרב‎ lest, by using
the word ‏,הרבה‎ he might be suspected of making a shaw of hls penitence,
‏ומחטאתי טהרנל‎ “and be near me, belp me so that I may regain my inner
‏שי‎ purity, the ability to be receptive and to respand to all that is good and
Divine” (sce Commentary to Ley. 16:30),

—— Vv. 5. ‏.כי פשעי וגו"‎ “For I do not deceive myself in any manner
concerning the seriousness of my transgression. And the realization of the
levity which caused me to sin is ever before me.”
