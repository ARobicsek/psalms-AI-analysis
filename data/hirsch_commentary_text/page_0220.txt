‏זמה ,ימינס מלאה שוחד ,אנשי דמים‎ preponderantly denotes unbridled sensuality,
See Commentary to Leviticus 18:17. The bron reach out with their hands
to mat, sensual excesses comprise their ideal, while the ‏אנשי דמים‎ are willing
Vv to sacrifice the life and welfare of their fellow-men for selfish interests. Here
we have both these types symbolized by one graphic description—the left
hand reaches out for ‏זמה‎ and the right hand is filled with wmv.
‏שי‎ V. 11, ‏אלך‎ cana ‏.ואני‎ "1 shall continue to do as I have done
heretofore ‏בתמר הלכתר‎ (Verse 1). I shall devote all my energies to the
attainment of the one supreme goal. Redeem me, therefore, from all
‏ש‎ obstacles on this path and grant me the ability to maintain such a way of life.”
V. 12. ‏,רגלי וגו"‎ “Once I shall have reached the goat of my
endeavors, when God will have saved me from stumbling and wavering
(in justification of the trust expressed in Verse 1), when 1 shall have found
v firm footing, then I shall bless the Lord in public congregation as do all
others who have been delivered from dire peril.”

V. 1, For the explanation of the superscription ‏,לדו‎ sce Com
mentary to Psalm 25:1 and Psalm 26:1. Psalm 27, too, simply expresses
4 the thoughts and attitudes which filled David's spirit and guided him in his
life on earth. While Psalm 26, however, primarily spoke of the thoughts
and attitudes that formulated the basic principles of his moral endeavors,
—— Psalm 27 expresses those specific concepts that sustained David throughout
| all the vicissitudes of his life.
