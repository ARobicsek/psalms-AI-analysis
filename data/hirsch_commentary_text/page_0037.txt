more than one teacher: ‏והיה כעץ שתול על טלגי מים--אמרי דבי רבי ינאי כעץ שתול‎

ולא כעץ נטוע -- כל הלומד תורה מרב אחד אינו דואה סימן ברכה לפולם,

‎As opposed to the manifestation of the lives of the‏ .אשר פריו יתן בעתר

‎and the oxen, which is the result of the Influence of passion and‏ רשעים

‎from the source of the Torah will give “his fruit in its season”. He docs‏
‎everything that the Scriptural commandment expects of him, and does nothing‏
‎that has not grown and matured under the purifying and ennobling influence‏
‎“His leaf also does not wither.” To the‏ ,ועלהו לא יבול ‎of God's Torah.‏
