‎PSALM XXIV‏
‎By David. A Psalm. The 4 7‏ )1
כד 6 ‎ad he‏ לה +" ! ‎earth is the Lord’s and the fullness‏
‎thereof, the world of men and they 273 oa 535 Ayton‏
‎that dwell therein,‏
‎3S, Jewish spirit, therefore 1 know of no misfortune. Any situation, once I‏
‎understand it and once I know how to use it as a means of coming nearer to‏
‎God, brings me nothing but joy. The ordinary concept of ‘good fortune’‏
‎or ‘calamity’, therefore, no longer has any meaning for me. Changes in my‏
‎fortune cannot disturb the table of spiritual contentment which Thou bast‏ ש
‎set before me.”‏
כל ימי חיי ‎1K. “As Jong as I shall dwell on earth,‏ טוב וגל 6 ‎V.‏
‎only goodness and mercy shall follow me. Whatever this life may bring me,‏
‎Vv however teagic it may scem, I shall simply regard it as a gift of Thy goodness‏
‎and mercy. Once the days of my wanderings on earth shall be at an end,‏
‎‘dying’ to me will be nothing more than a ‘return’ home, a retum to the‏
‎Vv House of the Lord forever.”‏
‎ie., “into the bouse‏ ,123 ה' ‎but‏ ,אל בית ה' ‎We have here not simply‏
ושלת את השעיך במדבר ‎in order to dwell there forevermore.” Similarly we read‏
‎(Lev, 16:22) “into the desert."‏

‎PSALM XXIV‏
‎This is one of the few psalms which begin with‏ .לדוד מזמור .1 ‎V.‏ שי
‎According to our sages,‏ .מזמוד לדוד ‎instead of‏ לדוד מזמור ‎the superscription‏
‎shows that, when David wrote this particular‏ מזמור לדוד ‎the title phrase‏
‎psalm, he did not do so for the purpose of raising his downcast spirit to‏
‎Vv exaltation on the wings of his song. Instead, this superscription indicates‏
‎a situation in which David was already filled with inspiration before and‏
‎employed the medium of song only to express this Divinely-sent enthusiasm.‏
‎The few verses of this brief psalm contain the most profound truths that‏ ———
‎any mortal lips were ever privileged ta utter concerning the ways of God in‏
‎the history of man.‏
