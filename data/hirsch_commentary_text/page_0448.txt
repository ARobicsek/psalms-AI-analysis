the consolation, fortitude and exultation that vanquishes all pain, and thus
endows us with the strength to attain ultimate victory.
0. 2. ‏.אך וגל‎ The word ‏אך‎ recurs in the same sense in Verses 3,
‏שי‎ 6 and 7. The basic theme of this psalm is that, even when the hand of God
strikes us with pain and sorrow, we can tum to none but Him for comfort,
and can seek help and assistance from no other source. ‏דומיה‎ see Psalm
39:4, “My soul remains calm and silent only in the face of Him, Whose
v band has stricken me; it is from Him and no one else that I can expect my
salvation.”
. V. 3. ‏צור .אך הוא וגל‎ see Commentary to Deut. 32:4. David
Vv declares, “For it is He, and He alone, Who reveals Himself to me as truly
being the One Who teaches me fortitude in the midst of sorrow, and grants
me salvation even through the very pain I suffer. He becomes my high
‏ש‎ tower, raising me high above all pain, so that, even though I may be shaken,
1 shall not be greatly swayed.” ‏רבה‎ and also ‏רבת‎ are used adverbially like
‏וישק כתהמות רבה .הרבה‎ (Psalm 78:15), ‏רבת צררוני‎ (Psalm 129:1(, ‏דבת‎
‏שבעה לה נפשנר‎ (Psalm 123:4( .
‏ש‎ V. 4. = ‏.עד וגל‎ The interpretation of this verse presents considerable
difficulty. nit or ‏,התת‎ of which ‏ההותתר‎ would be the Piel form, is not found
elsewhere in the Book of Psalms, There is a possibility that it may be
Vv derived from nna, which is related to nnn, and means “to frighten," as
does the Piel form of nnn, ‏וחתתני בהלומות‎ (Job, 7:14). ‏הותת על‎ ₪ “to
—— strike terror into a person." wmrin is ‏,פועל‎ formed in the samo manner as
‏שדדה‎ in ma ‏שדדה‎ (Nahum 3:7}, ‏קיר‎ is the wall of a house which limits
the area in which the residents of the house dwell. ‏גדר‎ is the outer fence
| which bars strangers from entry even to the outer courtyards of the residence.
