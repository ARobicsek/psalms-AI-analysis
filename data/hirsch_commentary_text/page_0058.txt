‘Chap, 4:2),

‘V. 4. ‏.ה' בקר וגו‎ The word ‏בקר‎ as used in the first part of this verse
is intended to denote a time of day, the actual morning that recurs daily, ‘The
second time the word ‏בקר‎ occurs, it is meant to indicate the dawning of a new
day in the history of mankind. It refers to the era which shalt replace the

- gloomy present, benighted by error and trouble, the end of that long night in
the evolution of the world. Hence a period of disaster is always referred to
asa “night”, while the dawning of salvation is described in the allegorical
simile of the “morning” or the “dawn". But, allegorically, the clear signifi-
cance of ‏בקר‎ as a “time of distinguishing” as opposed to ‏ערב‎ and ‏,לילה‎ the

Vv time when 811 things are commingled and intermingled (See Comm. to Gen.
1:5), will become apparent when we think how difficult it often is nowadays
at a cursory glance to distinguish between the honest man and his false

‎brother, For so many wicked men seem to enjoy good fortune, while fre~‏ ש
‎however, is that long-awaited dawn at‏ ,בקר ‎quently good men must suffer.‏
‎which God's justice will mete out the final and fitting fate to the righteous and‏
‎the wicked, each according to his merit, and thus plainly show to the world‏

‎v the distinction between the two. Thus it is said ‏אמר שומד אתא בקר‎ (Isaiah
21:12); ‏שבענו בבקר חסדך‎ (Ps. 90:14); ‏להגיך בכקר חסדך‎ (Ps, 92:3); ‏השמיעני‎
‏בבקר חסרך‎ (Ps. 143:8( ; ‏וירדו בם ישרים לבקר‎ (Ps. 49:15). And particularly

‎David (If Sam, 23:3) speaks of the time at which righteousness and the fear‏ שי
‎of God shall reign supreme among men, as the “brightly dawning, cloudless‏
‎And it is David whom God‏ .וכאור בקר ‎MP‏ שמש בקר לא עבות ‎morning” “un‏
‎has appointed to be the herald of this new dawn.‏

‎4 ‘Thy is “to arrange” something, to put something into its proper place
and position. When used with reference to thoughts, it means “to present”
an idea in the proper manner, to portray it so as to make it clearly under-

‎Vv stood. ‏אוכיחך ואערכת לעיניך‎ (Ps, 50:21); ‏מערכי לב‎ (Prov. 16:1); the orderly
arrangement of thoughts before they are presented. ‘Thus it also means to

‎-- find, for a thing or a concept, the proper place due to it in accordance with its
value and significance: — ‏ערך אל‎ and —? ‏ערך‎ means “to deem as appropri-
ate; worthy of or equal to someone or something else”, ‏ערוך אליך‎ PK (Ps.
