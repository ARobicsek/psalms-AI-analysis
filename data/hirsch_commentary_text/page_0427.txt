‘at ‏כמר פתן‎ refers to the ‏דברי כזב‎ whose conceit leads them to believe that
‏ש‎ they surpass all other men in wisdom and who therefore are not receptive
to instruction to begin with, ‏חבר‎ ‘am, see Commentary to Deut. 18:11.
‏אשר לא ישמע‎ refers both to wm and ‏;פתן‎ the former is made deaf to reproach

then the tecth must be broken in its mouth. Such action is not harsh or hard-
hearted. To break the dangerous “teeth” of the wicked may seem a work
— of destruction, but in reality it is an act of mercy executed by a merciful
