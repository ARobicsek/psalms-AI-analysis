V. 11, 12, ‘ut ‏.בסיל ובער ,19 יראה‎ See Comm, to Gen. 7.

“Indeed, this'man dreams of living on here below even after his death.”

4 He can see that neither wisdom nor folly can safeguard a mortal from death.
He has seen ample proof that all men must die one day and feave their

wealth to others, And yet he and those of like mind still believe that, even

Vv though they may have to die and leave their riches behind for others to

and enjoyment of its own pleasure, reproduces and then dies and “falls

‎silent,” then be has no claim whatever to immortality, The literal meaning
