The Cry of Dereliction and the Song of Praise: A Comprehensive Critical, Philological, and Reception-Historical Analysis of Psalm 221. Introduction: The Psalm of the Cross and the CrownPsalm 22 occupies a unique and formidable position in the canon of the Hebrew Bible. It is a text that bridges the abyss between absolute human despair and the zenith of divine praise, traversing a theological landscape that moves from the "dust of death" to the universal worship of the "families of the nations." For the scholar of the Hebrew Bible, it presents a complex tapestry of textual variants, philological enigmas, and generic fluidity. For the historian of religion, it serves as a primary locus of the divergence between Jewish and Christian hermeneutics—a shared text that became a divided inheritance.This report provides a deep research package designed to serve as a comprehensive reader’s guide to Psalm 22. It integrates ancient Near Eastern comparative data, rigorous philological analysis of the Masoretic and Septuagintal traditions, medieval Jewish commentary, and the reception history that spans from the Passion narratives of the Gospels to the trauma literature of the Holocaust. The aim is to demonstrate that Psalm 22 is not merely a static liturgical poem but a dynamic theological instrument that has been continually reshaped and resignified by communities in crisis.The analysis proceeds in four major movements. First, we examine the text itself, grappling with the notorious textual cruces and the rich, often grotesque, imagery of the body in pain. Second, we situate the psalm within its ancient context, exploring the "cosmic geography" of Bashan and the parallels in Mesopotamian lament literature. Third, we trace the Jewish reception, highlighting the often-overlooked connections to the Esther narrative and the polemical strategies of medieval commentators like Rashi and Radak. Fourth, we explore the Christian appropriation of the psalm as the "Fifth Passion Narrative" and its modern cultural echoes in the works of Levi, Bernstein, and contemporary theology.2. Textual Criticism and Philology: The Battle Over the TextNo verse in the Psalter has generated more controversy, polemic, and paleographical scrutiny than Psalm 22:17 (MT 22:16). The textual history of this single line serves as a microcosm for the broader issues of transmission, translation, and theological interpretation that surround the entire psalm.2.1 The Crux Interpretum: Ka'ari vs. Ka'aruThe debate centers on the Hebrew phrase usually translated in the Masoretic Text (MT) as "like a lion my hands and my feet" (ka'ari yadai v'raglai) versus the Septuagint (LXX) reading "they pierced my hands and my feet" (ōryxan cheiras mou kai podas). The difference hangs on a single letter—the distinction between a yod (י) and a vav (ו)—yet the theological implications are vast.2.1.1 The Masoretic Reading: Ka'ari ("Like a Lion")The Masoretic Text, the standard received text of Judaism, reads כָּאֲרִי (ka'ari). Morphologically, this word is a compound of the inseparable preposition kaf ("like" or "as") and the noun arieh (lion). The alef suggests a longer spelling or a construct form.Contextual Consistency: Proponents of the MT reading emphasize the internal consistency of the psalm’s imagery. The protagonist is besieged by a bestiary of threats: "bulls" (v. 13), "ravening lions" (v. 14), "dogs" (v. 17), and "wild oxen" (v. 22). In this zoological context, the simile "like a lion" fits seamlessly. The lion is the archetypal predator in the Ancient Near East, representing the threat of being mauled or devoured.1The Problem of the Missing Verb: The primary philological difficulty with the MT reading is syntactic. The phrase "like a lion my hands and my feet" lacks a finite verb. It functions as an elliptical verbless clause. Jewish commentators have historically supplied the missing action based on context. Rashi, for example, glosses the phrase as: "As if crushed by the mouth of a lion are my hands and my feet".3 Other translators suggest "they are at my hands and feet," implying a gnawing or mauling action typical of a lion’s attack. The ellipsis is poetic, forcing the reader to visualize the lion’s interaction with the limbs—an interaction that is invariably destructive.32.1.2 The Septuagint and the "Pierced" TraditionThe Septuagint (LXX), the pre-Christian Greek translation, renders the phrase as ὤρυξαν (ōryxan), a verb meaning "they dug," "mined," or "excavated." This translation choice presupposes a Hebrew Vorlage (source text) that read either karu (from the root karah, "to dig") or ka'aru (a longer, perhaps archaic, spelling).Etymological Analysis: The root karah (כרה) is well-attested in Biblical Hebrew, usually referring to digging a well (Gen 26:25) or a grave (Ps 7:16). Critics of the "pierced" reading argue that "digging" hands and feet is semantically incongruous; one pierces flesh, one digs soil.5 However, defenders of the reading argue for a semantic range that includes "boring through" or "gouging." The logic is that just as one digs through a wall or the earth, the enemies have "dug through" the psalmist’s extremities. This reading aligns with the Latin Vulgate (foderunt, "they dug") and the Syriac Peshitta (baz', "they pierced/penetrated").6The Paleographical Pivot: The confusion likely arises from the orthography of the Second Temple period. In the Herodian script (c. 30 BCE – 70 CE), the letters yod (י) and vav (ו) were often indistinguishable in length. A scribe copying a text could easily misread ka'aru (ending in vav - "they dug") as ka'ari (ending in yod - "like a lion"). This paleographical ambiguity is the "ground zero" of the controversy.72.1.3 Evidence from the Dead Sea ScrollsThe discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls moved the debate from speculation to empirical observation. Two specific manuscripts are critical:Nahal Hever (5/6HevPs): This fragmentary scroll, dating to 50–68 CE, contains the line in question. The word is clearly visible. Apologists and some textual critics argue that the final letter is a long vav, confirming the reading ka'aru ("they dug/pierced"). This would provide pre-Masoretic Hebrew support for the LXX and Christian interpretation.9 However, a rigorous paleographical analysis reveals ambiguity. In this specific scribe's handwriting, yods and vavs are notoriously inconsistent; some yods are long, and some vavs are short. While the letter looks like a vav, it is not decisively distinct from the yods found elsewhere in the same fragment. Thus, while Nahal Hever allows for the "pierced" reading, it does not incontrovertibly prove it against the "lion" reading.44QPs^f: This manuscript from Qumran is damaged but appears to contain a verbal form, potentially karu, supporting the "dig/pierce" tradition over the noun "lion." However, the fragmentary nature of the text requires reconstruction, leaving room for scholarly caution.112.2 The "Worm" (Tola'at) and the Philology of DyeVerse 7 (MT v. 6) introduces a jarring metaphor: "But I am a worm (tola'at) and not a man." The Hebrew language possesses several words for "worm," most notably rimmah, which refers to the maggots associated with decay and rot. However, the psalmist specifically chooses tola'at.Biological and Cultic Context: The tola'at (specifically tola'at shani) refers to the Coccus ilicis, a scale insect found on oak trees in the Near East. In the ancient world, this insect was the source of the highly prized crimson or scarlet dye used in the Tabernacle curtains (Exod 26:1) and the High Priest's garments.The Life Cycle: The biological life cycle of the female Coccus ilicis has generated significant homiletic and theological reflection. The female attaches herself permanently to the tree to lay eggs. In the process, her body dies and secretes a red fluid that stains the wood and covers the larvae, protecting them. After three days, the red body turns white and waxy, falling to the ground like snow.Theological Implications: This specific philological choice creates a "remez" (hint) connecting the psalmist's suffering to the concept of atonement and royalty. The sufferer is crushed, like the tola'at, but this crushing produces the "royal" dye of redemption. Christian interpreters have heavily utilized this imagery to draw parallels to the crucifixion: dying on a tree, the shedding of blood to "cover" the children, and the transformation from scarlet sin to white purity (cf. Isaiah 1:18).122.3 Other Key Terms and Hapax LegomenaAyelet HaShahar (Heading): "The Doe of the Dawn." This phrase, likely a musical incipit directing the choir leader to a specific tune, acts as a hapax legomenon phrase (occurring only here). Rabbinic tradition interprets the "Doe" as a metaphor for the redemption of Israel, which rises slowly like the dawn, or specifically as Queen Esther, whose beauty and plight are likened to the morning star.16Yechidah (v. 20): "My Only One." Translated variously as "my soul," "my life," or "my precious life," yechidah literally means "my only one." It stands in parallel to nafshi (my soul/life). The use of yechidah emphasizes the singularity and irreplaceable value of the life currently under threat by the "power of the dog." The psalmist possesses nothing else; this life is their sole possession, making the threat of the dog (desecration) all the more terrifying.193. Ancient Near Eastern Context: Cosmic Geography and Shared MotifsPsalm 22 does not exist in a vacuum. It shares a rich conceptual and literary heritage with the cultures of Mesopotamia and Ugarit (Syria), particularly in its depiction of the "Righteous Sufferer" and its zoological iconography.3.1 The Mesopotamian "Righteous Sufferer"The most striking parallel to Psalm 22 in Akkadian literature is the poem Ludlul bēl nēmeqi ("I Will Praise the Lord of Wisdom"), often referred to as the Babylonian Job. The protagonist, Shubshi-meshre-Shakkan, describes a similar trajectory from high status to utter abjection and divine silence.The Silence of the Gods: Just as the Psalmist cries "I call by day, but You do not answer" (Ps 22:2), the Babylonian sufferer laments, "I called to my god, but he did not show me his face; I prayed to my goddess, but she did not raise her head".21 This shared motif of the Deus absconditus (hidden god) suggests a common ANE theological anxiety: the terrifying silence of the divine patron who is contractually obligated to protect the devotee.Somatic Disintegration: Both texts utilize a "symptomatology of suffering." The Babylonian text describes the physical collapse in visceral detail: "Terror and panic turned my flesh pale... My guts trembled in perpetual fear".21 Psalm 22 matches this with "I am poured out like water," "my bones are out of joint," "my heart is like wax," and "my tongue sticks to my jaws" (vv. 14-15). This suggests a shared literary convention where spiritual abandonment is invariably somatized—the body dissolves when the connection to the divine is severed.3.2 The Cosmic Geography of BashanIn verse 12, the psalmist complains: "Many bulls surround me; strong bulls of Bashan encircle me." To the modern reader, this is a pastoral metaphor. To the ancient Israelite, it was a reference to cosmic geography.Bashan and the Rephaim: Bashan, the fertile plateau east of the Sea of Galilee, was famous for its livestock (Deut 32:14, Amos 4:1). However, in the biblical and Ugaritic worldview, Bashan was also the domain of Og, the last of the Rephaim (giants), and was associated with Mount Hermon, the traditional site of the descent of the Watchers (fallen angels) in 1 Enoch.Demonic Encirclement: Therefore, the "Bulls of Bashan" are not merely strong animals. They are avatars of the chaotic, anti-divine forces associated with the underworld and the enemies of YHWH. The encirclement described in Psalm 22 is not just a military siege but a spiritual assault by the forces of "Death" (Mavet) and the demonic realm. The "lions" and "dogs" that follow reinforce this: the lion is the symbol of the god of death (Mot) in Ugaritic, and dogs are the scavengers of the underworld.233.3 Ugaritic Literary ParallelsThe Ras Shamra texts (Ugaritic) clarify the poetic structure of the psalm.Word Pairs: The Hebrew pairing of "weeping" and "tears" or "roaring" and "groaning" finds exact cognates in the Kirta Epic (bkh and dm'). The "repetition" of divine names in the opening cry ("Eli, Eli") mirrors the repetitive invocations in Ugaritic prayer formulas.26The Pattern of Reversal: The narrative arc of the Kirta Epic, which moves from the king's loss of family and health to his restoration by the high god El, provides a narrative template for the structure of Psalm 22—a sudden, divinely initiated reversal of fortune that leads to feasting and communal stability.4. Literary Analysis: Structure, Unity, and the "Turn"The most contentious issue in the literary analysis of Psalm 22 is the relationship between its two distinct halves: the Lament (vv. 1-21) and the Praise (vv. 22-31). The transition between them is so abrupt that it has led many scholars to question the unity of the composition.4.1 The Redactional Hypothesis vs. Literary UnityEarly form critics, such as Hermann Gunkel, often viewed the psalm as a composite work. They argued that verses 22-31 were a later liturgical addition—a separate hymn tacked onto a lament to make it suitable for temple worship. The argument rests on the shift in tone: verses 1-21 are intensely personal, marked by the singular "I" and "Thou," while verses 22-31 are communal and universal, invoking the "congregation" and the "nations".28However, recent rhetorical and structural studies argue convincingly for the psalm's integrity.The Vow of Praise: It is a standard feature of the "Individual Lament" genre to conclude with a "Vow of Praise." The sufferer promises that if YHWH delivers them, they will offer a sacrifice (often the todah or thanksgiving offering) and testify to the community. Psalm 22 simply expands this vow into a full-blown descriptive praise. The "feast" mentioned in verse 26 ("The poor shall eat and be satisfied") is the sacrificial meal shared by the worshiper and the community following the deliverance.30Chiastic Structure: Pierre Auffret and other scholars have identified a sophisticated chiastic structure (A-B-C | X | C'-B'-A') that weaves the two halves together. The themes of the first half are mirrored and resolved in the second.Table 1: The Chiastic Structure of Psalm 22 (Synthesis of Auffret/Wendland)SectionVersesThemeA (Cry)1-5The cry of dereliction; ancestral trust ("Our fathers trusted").B (Scorn)6-11The "worm" motif; scorn of men; trust from the womb.C (Threat)12-18Encircled by Bulls, Lions, Dogs; physical disintegration.X (Pivot)19-21The Plea: "Deliver my soul... You have answered me!"C' (Praise)22-26Praise in the congregation; the "afflicted" are fed (reversal of disintegration).B' (Scope)27-29Universal worship; "all families of the nations" (reversal of scorn).A' (Future)30-31Future generations; "He has done it" (resolution of the cry).This structure demonstrates that the praise section is not an add-on but the theological telos (goal) of the lament. The suffering is narrated specifically to set the stage for the magnitude of the deliverance.314.2 The "Turn" (Verse 21b)The pivot of the entire psalm occurs in the second half of verse 21 (MT v. 22). The Masoretic Text reads anitani ("You have answered me"). This single word marks the instant of salvation.The Sudden Shift: Up until this word, the heavens are brass. The psalmist is "poured out like water." Then, mid-sentence, the plea "Save me from the lion's mouth" transforms into the declaration "You have answered me!" (or "You have rescued me" in some translations like the LXX).Theological Significance: This abruptness suggests that the act of salvation is not a gradual process but a decisive divine intervention. The silence of verse 2 is broken. The rest of the psalm (vv. 22-31) flows entirely from this single moment of being "heard" or "answered".344.3 The Sociology of PraiseThe second half of the psalm outlines a "ripple effect" of evangelism. The news of the deliverance spreads in widening concentric circles:The Brethren: "I will declare Your name to my brothers" (v. 22). The immediate circle of the psalmist.The Congregation: "In the midst of the congregation" (v. 22, 25). The liturgical community of Israel.The Nations: "All the ends of the world shall remember and turn" (v. 27). The Gentile nations.The Dead/Unborn: "All those who go down to the dust... a people yet to be born" (v. 29-31). The expansion crosses the boundaries of time and mortality.This universalism anticipates the prophetic vision of Isaiah 40-55, where the suffering of the Servant results in the justification of the "many".305. Jewish Reception History: From Esther to the ExileWhile Christian tradition has focused almost exclusively on the "suffering servant" aspect, Jewish interpretation has historically read Psalm 22 through the lens of national survival and the scroll of Esther.5.1 Midrashic Connections: Queen EstherThe relationship between Psalm 22 and the book of Esther is one of the most profound intertextual links in rabbinic literature.Ayelet HaShahar: The Talmud (Megillah 15b) identifies the "Doe of the Dawn" in the superscript as Esther. Why? Because just as the dawn breaks slowly and then bursts forth, so too was the redemption of Israel in the days of Mordecai. Furthermore, the "morning star" is the last star visible before the day; Esther is seen as the last of the miracles recorded in the biblical canon.16The Cry in the Palace: The Midrash (Midrash Tehillim) dramatizes Esther's approach to King Ahasuerus's throne room (Esther 5:1). It imagines that as she entered the "house of idols," the Shechinah (Divine Presence) departed from her. In that moment of spiritual void, she cries out the words of Psalm 22:1: "My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?".19The Dog and the Lion: The Midrash continues the parallel. Esther realizes she may have been abandoned because she called Ahasuerus a "dog" (Ps 22:20: "Deliver... my only one from the power of the dog"). She corrects herself and refers to him as a "lion" (v. 21: "Save me from the lion's mouth"), acknowledging his royalty while praying for safety. This reading transforms the psalm into a liturgy of political peril and court intrigue.195.2 Medieval Exegesis: Rashi and RadakThe medieval Jewish commentators (Rishonim) interpreted the psalm largely as a metaphor for the Jewish people (Knesset Yisrael) in the Galut (Exile).Rashi: Writing during a period of Crusader violence, Rashi interprets the "lion" at the hands and feet as the hostile nations that crush Israel. The physical suffering—bones out of joint, heart like wax—represents the communal exhaustion of the exiles. He explicitly rejects the christological "piercing" interpretation, anchoring the text in the collective Jewish experience.35Radak (David Kimchi): Radak offers a fierce polemic against Christian readings. He argues that the Christians have "distorted" the text by changing ka'ari to ka'aru to fabricate a prophecy of the crucifixion. He contends that even if ka'aru were the reading, it would mean "they dug" a pit or trap, not "pierced" with nails. Radak emphasizes that the "son" in Psalm 2 and the sufferer in Psalm 22 refer to David or the righteous of Israel, and that the "universal worship" at the end of the psalm refers to the Messianic era when nations will recognize the God of Israel, not a specific converted deity.375.3 Liturgical UsageThe psalm's connection to Esther has cemented its place in the liturgy of Purim. It is recited in many communities (particularly Sephardic and those following the Vilna Gaon) on the Fast of Esther and Purim morning. Additionally, verse 4 ("You are Holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel") is a cornerstone of the Uva Letzion prayer recited daily and on High Holy Days, reinforcing the theology that God's kingship is sustained by the prayers of His people.396. Christian Reception History: The Fifth Passion NarrativeFor Christianity, Psalm 22 is the "Fifth Passion Narrative," arguably more influential in shaping the Gospel accounts of the crucifixion than the historical memories of the eyewitnesses themselves.6.1 The New Testament AppropriationThe Gospels utilize Psalm 22 not as a proof-text but as the structural backbone of the passion narrative.The Cry of Dereliction: Jesus' cry on the cross, Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani (Matt 27:46; Mark 15:34), is the only saying from the cross recorded in Mark and Matthew. It is a direct Aramaization of Psalm 22:1. Theological debate persists: did Jesus recite it to express total abandonment (the "cry of the damned"), or did he recite the first verse to invoke the entire psalm, implying his confidence in the final victory ("He has done it")? The latter view, common in classical theology, suggests Jesus died with the song of victory on his lips.41Mark's Inverted Allusion: A fascinating literary analysis suggests that Mark alludes to Psalm 22 in reverse order. He begins with the dividing of garments (Mark 15:24 / Ps 22:18), moves to the mocking (Mark 15:29 / Ps 22:7), and ends with the cry of forsakenness (Mark 15:34 / Ps 22:1). This rhetorical strategy "deconstructs" the psalm, moving from the external threat to the internal spiritual collapse, emphasizing the disintegration of Jesus' world. However, by invoking the psalm, the unquoted ending (the resurrection/praise) hangs in the air as the implied resolution.44Specific Fulfillments: The casting of lots for the tunic (John 19:24) and the specific mockery ("He trusts in God, let Him deliver him") are explicit fulfillments of verses 18 and 8, respectively.6.2 Patristic Exegesis: Totus ChristusJustin Martyr: In his Dialogue with Trypho, Justin uses Psalm 22 as his primary weapon. He accuses the Jews of removing the "pierced" reading from their manuscripts. He argues that David never suffered piercing of hands and feet; therefore, the psalm must be about the Messiah. He reads the "bulls" and "unicorns" (wild oxen) as symbols of the arrogant Jewish leaders and Roman soldiers.45Augustine: Augustine interprets the psalm through the hermeneutic of the Totus Christus (Whole Christ). The Head (Jesus) speaks the first verse on the cross, taking on the sins of the body. The Body (the Church) speaks the praise in the second half. For Augustine, the "worm" (v. 6) is a sign of Christ's virgin birth—since worms were believed to be generated spontaneously from the earth without sexual union, Christ is the "worm" born without a human father.486.3 Liturgical Usage: TenebraeIn the Western liturgical tradition, Psalm 22 is the centerpiece of the Tenebrae ("Shadows") service during Holy Week (Maundy Thursday/Good Friday). As the candles are extinguished one by one, symbolizing the abandonment of Jesus by his disciples, the psalm is chanted. This often accompanies the "stripping of the altar," a ritual removal of all ornaments and cloths, physically enacting the verse "they divide my garments among them".507. Modern Literary and Cultural EchoesThe raw power of Psalm 22 continues to resonate in the modern era, particularly in response to the traumas of the 20th century.7.1 Holocaust Literature: Primo Levi's Anti-PsalmIn his seminal memoir If This Is a Man (Se questo è un uomo), Primo Levi engages in a dark, subversive intertextuality with the biblical tradition.The Anti-Creation: Levi describes the Auschwitz Lager as a place where the moral universe of the Psalms is inverted. The "worm" of Psalm 22 is actualized in the Muselmann—the prisoner who has reached the nadir of exhaustion and dehumanization, becoming "non-men."The Silence of God: Levi's narrative inhabits the space of Psalm 22:2 ("I call... but You do not answer") but refuses the "turn" to praise. In the camp, there is no "You have answered me." When a religious prisoner thanks God for avoiding selection, Levi writes, "If I were God, I would spit at Kuhn's prayer." For Levi, the psalm's promise of deliverance is shattered by the reality of the gas chambers. The text becomes an "anti-psalm," witnessing to a silence that does not end.517.2 Bernstein's Chichester Psalms: The Clash of TextsLeonard Bernstein's Chichester Psalms (1965) captures the tension of Psalm 22 musically, even while setting other texts.The Conflict: In the second movement, a boy soprano sings the tranquil Psalm 23 ("The Lord is my Shepherd"). This is violently interrupted by the men's chorus singing Psalm 2 ("Why do the nations rage?"). The dissonant, martial music of the nations threatens to drown out the innocent trust of the shepherd. While Psalm 22 is not the sung text, the thematic conflict—the vulnerability of the "worm" against the "bulls"—is the emotional core of the piece. Bernstein, a Jew grappling with the crisis of faith in the 20th century, uses this juxtaposition to ask the question of Psalm 22: Can trust survive in a world of raging nations?.557.3 Visual Art: Eli, Eli, Lama SabachthaniThe cry of verse 1 has inspired countless visual representations. Notably, the Dutch artist Rinze Hamstra (1937) created a drawing titled Eli Lama Sabachtani, depicting a larger-than-life, thorn-crowned head of Christ. The focus is entirely on the psychological horror of the abandonment, stripping away the classical serenity of the crucifixion to reveal the raw agony of the Psalmist's question.578. Conclusion: The Inexhaustible TextPsalm 22 stands as a monument to the human capacity to articulate suffering in the presence of the divine. Its textual history—from the scribal debates at Nahal Hever to the polemics of Radak—reveals the high stakes of its interpretation. Whether read as the "Lion" mauling the exiles of Israel or the "piercing" of the Messiah's hands, the text forces the reader to confront the reality of violence.Yet, the psalm's structural genius lies in its refusal to end in the dust. The "turn" in verse 21b, from the plea for safety to the declaration of rescue, creates a theological trajectory that has sustained both Jewish and Christian communities. For the Jew, it is the promise that the "Doe of the Dawn" will rise after the long night of Exile. For the Christian, it is the assurance that the cross is not the end, but the prelude to the "congregation" of the resurrection.The psalm concludes with the phrase ki asah—"for He has done it" (v. 31). This performative declaration asserts that the suffering was not in vain; it has accomplished a redemption that the "coming generation" will proclaim. In a world still replete with "bulls" and "dogs," Psalm 22 remains the essential script for those waiting for the dawn.
