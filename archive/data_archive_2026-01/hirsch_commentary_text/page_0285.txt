‎PSALM XXXVI‏
‎V. 1, In Verses 2—S David outlines the philosophy that motivated‏

‎these motives and will finally destroy all evil. David has derived this insight‏
‎and perception from his own personal experiences in life both as “David,”‏
‎Vv an individual man, and as “the servant of the Lord,” a Jew who strives to‏
‎fulfill the task which God has entrusted to him. In both these capacities‏
‎David has come to know the true nature of the ways of thinking of his‏

‎Commentary to Gen. 5:30, 31). To him whose life is ruled by lawless‏
‎caprice, transgression itself seems a pronouncement of the Lord. For‏
‎whenever transgression tempts him, he tells himself that if the omnipotent‏
‎Vv God did not desite evil, He could have prevented by making it appear uo-‏
‎attractive to man and impossible for him to commit. Thus, since the Lord‏
‎seems to be doing nothing to prevent him from doing evil, he thinks that‏ ---
‎both the very urge to do wrong which he feels within himself, and the clear‏ _
‎pro-‏ נאם ‎way which he sees before him to its successful execution, are‏
‎nouncements of the Lord, showing that He actually approves of wrangdoing.‏ |
