embedded in the ground of the testimony of God's Law, We would also like
to point out here that Solomon put a crown of “rose work” ‏וכתרות אשר)‎
‏ראש העפדים מעשה שוטן באולם‎ by—Kings 1 7:15--22( upon the two columns
placed before the entrance of the bara. These pillars, of which he called the
‘one on the right 12%, while he designated the one on the left ‏,בת‎ most

/ likely were intended to symbolize Israel's dual ideal of ever-progressing

5 activity of building and shaping ‏(יכין)‎ on one hand, and its proven inner
fortitude (7712) on the other. Thus it would not be amiss for us to say
that “Israel stood erect at the portals of the Sanctuary of the Law as

had been the helpless target of attacks and pillage from the neighboring
