Vv phenomena of daily existence, and that all living things exist and do their
tasks under the device of this one word, of Creation. ‏,לילה ללילה‎ the ex-
perience of one night is testimony for the other. It will “revive” and “keep
‏ש‎ alive” the realization that nyt, one “Knowledge” watches over the entire
world as it Hes languid with sleep. This “Knowledge” neither slumbers not

things with loving care and lets them reawaken from the sleep of exhaustion
Vv to the renewed independence of life. One day speaks to the other, “Rise
up and serve the ‘Word’,” and one night says to the other, “Lie down in
peace, there is one ‘Knowledge’ that watches over you.” ‏אמר‎ predominantly
