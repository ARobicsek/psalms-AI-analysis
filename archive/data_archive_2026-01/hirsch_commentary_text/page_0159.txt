of Joseph (Psalm 105:19( ‏,אמרת ה' צרפתהו‎ “after the decree of the Lord bad
purified him.”
‏וגו‎ #07 8, but because Divine providence has purification as its sole
Vv purpose, He will protect those who will put their trust in Him so that they
will not perish under the impact of the sufferings He bas sent them,
V.32. | ‏.בי מי וגו'‎ For only the same God Who has sent man suffer '
‏שי‎ ing can also save him from succumbing to this affliction, because there is no
other God or Rock beside Him.
‏האל 31‘ .33 ער‎ The same God Who arms me with bravery to combat
‏ש‎ my foes also guides my way of life to moral perfection, He gitded me to
fight my enemies from without by helping me attain victory within myseif
first, My bravery rests solely upon a basis of inner moral integrity.”
V.34, 35. ‏וגו‎ aie, “It is He Who guides and motivates all my acts
Vv in my war ‏סקט‎ my enemies from without, He lends wings to my feet in
order that I may attain victory, He helps me to persist in the high places
which I have already reached. He trains my hands for warfare, but He also
‏שי‎ teaches my atms to lower the brazen bow, thus offering peace to the foc.”

into me." “Thou also teachest my arms to lower the bow, to keep it lowered
as a signal of peace. Thou dost train me in warfare, but also in refraining
— from combat. The Lord shows me how to resist the provocation of the foe
| and the temptation to fight.”
