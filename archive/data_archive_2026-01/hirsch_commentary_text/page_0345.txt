Israel was part of the goal set for mankind by God's Sovereignty. ‏,בי רציתם‎
for God had found in Israel a group of men and women which had dedicated
Vv itself to the fulfillment of His will in every aspect of life, both individual

74212). ‏ישועות יפקב.‎ mvs. “Even while we are only ‏,יקב‎ the people ground
