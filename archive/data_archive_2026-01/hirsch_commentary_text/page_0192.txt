‘V.17. ‘a1 ‏.כי סבבוני כלבים‎ “Art Thou so determined to put an end
to my existence that I am now surrounded no longer by ‏פרים‎ and ‏,אבירי בשן‎
but by dogs scenting carrion? Mobs, the basest scum of the nations, enclose

Vv me, and, like lions to be dreaded, they paralyze my hands and feet so that
[am powerless cither to defend myself, or to flee. The fact that I have now
come to fear even the basest of mobs seems to me a sure sign that I must

Vv die.” Since the ‏אתנח‎ in ‏הקיפוני‎ follows an ‏עולה ויורד‎ in the word ‏,כלבים‎ it
cannot divide the sentence, and therefore ‏הקימוני‎ 10801262 with ‏,כארי וגו‎
forms one sentence. Thus the ‏בי‎ in the word ‏הקיפוני‎ cannot properly denote
an accusative, but indicates the dative form, ‏לי כארי ידי ורגלי‎ wpa, like

Vv ‏והשובני דבר‎ (Gen. 37:14), would mean the same as ‏ארץ הנגב ;והשיב לי דבר‎
‏בתתנר‎ (Jos. 15:19) would be the same as * nna, and elsewhere.

‎In this verse, Israel, exiled, takes comfort amidst‏ .אספר 3" ,18 ‎V.‏ ש
‎all its suffering. As already shown in Verses 4 and 5, 151001, amidst dangers‏
‎and perils threatening to engulf it, nurtures the memorics of its past life‏
‎which was filled and upheld by the Lord. Israel still celebrates the feasts‏

‎v commemorating its deliverance by God, the revelation of its Divine Law,
and its preservation by the Lord. It has preserved the memory of all that
which has sustained it in the past and which holds the promise for its future

‎they look upon me in amazement, “They can-‏ ,המה יביטו ‎survival, ‘2 WY‏ ש
‎not understand,” says David, “how, instead of contemplating my present sad‏

‎— state and the threatening future, and instead of casting about for means of

‎rescue, I cherish the memories of days long past, as if I were presently at

‎--- peace. They cannot see how 1 can find comfort and inspiration in such
| recollections.” (Cf. Ps. 34:21).
