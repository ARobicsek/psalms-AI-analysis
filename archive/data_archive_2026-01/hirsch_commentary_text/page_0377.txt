psalmist no longer fears that his life will lose any of its true value merely

abundance of their tangible wealth. They use their possessions only for
selfish purposes and not as a means toward the end of fulfilling their duty.
‏ש‎ They fail to employ their riches to free their fellowmen from want and care,
and so neglect to pay God the “ransom due Him for their own souls.”

‏ש‎ pleasures. In thanksgiving for their prosperity, they should have given
some contribution commensurate with their wealth and ability toward the
advancement of the welfare of their fellow men, but they have sadly failed to
‏שי‎ do so. Because they have neglected this duty, ‏,הדל נפשם לעולם‎ “their soul
