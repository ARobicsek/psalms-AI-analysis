Vv Vv. 4, ‏,ישפט וגר‎ In the preceding verses, David describes the ideal
state in accordance with Jewish law. “But,” he continues, “in instances where
society fails to do its duty, or individuals misuse thei power, ‏וגו'‎ baw, there
let the king wield his own power and authority in behalf of the ‏,עניי עם‎ “the

4 poor of society.” Let him defend their rights and their claim upon God's
bounty. Let him assert his authority in behalf of the welfare of the children
of the ‏,אביונים‎ of those who must “submit” ‏(אבה)‎ to the will of others because

‎they are devoid of power and wealth, who have no voice, and whose word.‏ שי
‎But in instances where the‏ .וירכא עושק ‎and opinion are ignored by society.‏
‎there‏ ,עני ואכיון ‎are denied their rights, simply because they are‏ אביון ‎‘ay and‏

‎own example and his personal influence, cause all the society of the Jewish‏

‎Vv nation, both as ‘citizens of the state’ and as individuals, to fear not him,
the king, but only God!" The daytime is devoted to the pursuit of social and
civic duties into the sphere of which every person enters with the rising of

‎the sun, It is only at night, “before the moon,” that each citizen retires to‏ שי
‎his own fife as an individual. “Both by day and by night,” says David, “let‏

‎-- every man, both as a citizen of the state and as an individual, under the

‎public eye as well as in quiet retirement, live every moment of his life filled

‎--- ‘with the fear of God and guided thereby. May such be the fruits of the king's
| seign in the midst of the nation.”
