‏.מכל פשעי וגו" .9 שער‎ This is a two-fold plea. First, “Let me receive
all the chastisement and inner stimulation to make me free at last from every
Vv temptation to transgress Thy will.” Second, "iM ‏חרפת‎ “Let me retain my
spiritual and moral fortitude even in the face of these sufferings which are
intended to train me, so that, even if I should fall either physically or’ in
‏ש‎ social stature, I may still not become the faughing stock of evil men.”

V. 10. ‏.גאלמתי וגו'‎ “For, even as I kept silent then, I will keep
silent now, I shall not open my mouth again, but I shall accept everything
calmly and with resignation, knowing that it is all part of Thy Providence.”

Vv ‏וגל ,11 .ףר‎ 107, “Therefore I no longer shall ask Thee to spare
me blows of fate that are intended to train and discipline me. But if I am
to endure these sufferings I must pray Thee to remove, at times, Thy finger

‎V.12, 7s ‏.בתוכחות‎ “Wherever Thou didst let ‏,חמודו‎ that in which

been devoured by moths. It was Thy aim mercly thus to make him mend
