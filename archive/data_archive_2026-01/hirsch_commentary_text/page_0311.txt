‎PSALM XXXVIII
‘V. 1. ‏:להזכיך‎ “To serve as a memorial.” It is David's desire to
Vv remember forever even in days of happiness and prosperity the’ emotions
and thoughts that filled him during the sad period in his life when he penned
this psalm. Prime among the thoughts expressed in this Chapter is David's
‏שי‎ ayowal that he was bowed down not so much by the suffering caused him
by the onslaughts of illness and foes, as by the feeling of guilt, the remorse~
ful realization that he bad desesved these sufferings because of the sins he
had committed against God. David did well to set down this fact for future
Vv recollection, because nothing is better suited to keep us from going astray
in happier days than the mere memory of how crushing and depressiog
remorse can be, and how unbappy it can make ws.
‏שי‎ V. 2, 3, ‏.ה' אל בקצפך‎ See Psalm 6:2. "xp see Commentary to
Deut. 9:7, “I need no wrathful rebuke and chastisement to make me realize
— that 1 have sinned and that I must mend my ways,” says David, “For
Thy arrows go deep into me even when it is only Thy chastising hand that
--- comes down upon me. The mere knowledge that I am deserving of punish-
| ment is to me the most grievous penalty of all.” :
