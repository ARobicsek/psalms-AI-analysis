5 which He inspired in David. ‏,אחסה בר‎ “to Whom I could look and did look
- with confidence in everything that Iam and have ever done”. The Lord seat
him aid, protection and encouragement for the duties David had to perform
in his exalted position for the general welfare of his people. He was David's
‏מגך‎ in his defensive wars on behalf of his people, and ‏,קרן ישפי‎ his Hom of
‏שי‎ Victory which helped him win in these struggles, Finally, the Lord was
David’s ‏;משגב‎ He tet him reach high places, towering above all others (see.

Commentary to Gen. 25:8).

‎The passages that follow Verse 3 constitute a detailed description‏ שי
‎of these three ways in which God’s rule could be seen in David's life. Verses‏
‎showing us God in His saving‏ ,סלפ ומצודתי ומפלטי ‎elaborate upon‏ 4—20
‎describing Him as‏ ,אלי צורי אחסה בו ‎power, Verses 21—36 enlarge upon‏

‎Vv training David for his sacred calling. Verses 36—49 enumerate what the
Lord has wrought as ‏,מגני וקרן ישעי משגבי‎ granting victory to His people in
their struggles.

‎Vv V. 4. ‏.מהלל וג‎ When David experienced the first crises in his own
personal Iife, he did not have to wait in order to find out whether God would
indeed reveal His might by some intervention on His part. He had known

‎Vv of similar manifestations of God's power in events throughout the previous
history of His people. The entire course of Israel's history was nothing but a
series of emanations of Divine rays of light, mbnn, which proclaimed God's
Sovereignty and His hand in all of history (see Comm. to Exod, 15:11).

‎Vv David's spirit had been nourished by these ‏תהלות‎ of Jewish tradition. By the
time he embarked upon his mission in life, David was already thoroughly
imbued with the consciousness of God. It was in this spirit that he saw

‎-- God even at the hour of danger. He called upon the Lord in accordance
| with what he already knew of the ways in which He had shown His might
in the past history of His people.
