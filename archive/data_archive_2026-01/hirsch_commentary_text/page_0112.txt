‎constancy and his true joy in doing what is expected of him, 11 righteous

‎living per se would guarantee immediate happiness and if wickedness would‏ ש
‎result in immediate adversity, then cleverness and calculation and not a sense‏

‘The morally free calling of man, the ideals of which are laid down wip ‏,בהיכל‎

‎and for which individuals and groups of men alike must be trained, has as

‎its basic prerequisite a testing of the righteous by means of suffering as well‏ ש
‎as a show of temporary fortune and prosperity for the wicked. Sec Psalm‏

‎7:10. Cf. Commentary to Deut, 7:10, 8:2, Thus the sufferings of the

‎righteous man are actually proof of God's love and of the interest the Lord

‎Vv takes in this man’s progress on the road to moral perfection. The greater
his moral strength, the more rigorous will be the tests to which he may be

‎subjected. It is never the poorest student in the class at school who is given

‏מוסר ה' בני :12 ,3:11 ‎the most difficult tasks to solve. Thus we read in Prov.‏ שי

‎is by no means a sign of the favor of Divine Providence, but quite the con-‏ ש

‎of profiting by it. If ill were to befall him, he would not mend his ways; on

‎000 the contrary, he might thus be led to perpetrate even greater excesses, These
are matters of which only the cye of God that sees into all things can be the
