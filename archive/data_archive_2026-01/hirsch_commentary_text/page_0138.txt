6. 3. ‏חלקי .ה מנת חלקי וגר‎ is “my inhentance™ of material goods;
‏כוסר‎ is “my inheritance” of joys and pleasures, It is not said here, “The
Lord ordains my portion and my cup; the determination of my portion and
my cup comes from the Lord.” Instead, David states, “The Lord is ‏מנת חלקי‎
Vv spin"; Le., “whatever is truly ‏מנתר‎ of ‏חלקי וכוסי‎ whatever possessions and
pleasures shall be mine on earth, that which lends them their true significance
for me is not their value per se, but the Lord Himself, He is my God, the
‏ש‎ guide of my destiny in whatever goods and pleasures, lavish or scant, He may
send me. The mere consciousness that this inheritance bas come to me from
Him, makes ‏חלקי וכוסי‎ precious to me.”
‏תומיך .אתה תומיך גורליי‎ may be the Kal, present tense, of ‏תמך‎ which
Vv is not used too frequently and which occurs in Isalah 38:5. ‏,הנני יוסיף על ימיך‎
“Thou supportest my fate, Thou givest a firm foundation to my fate.” It
is also possible that the word is used here as the future, Hiphil, of ‏ימך‎ which
‏ש‎ is synonymous with pp, “to be low”, like ‏טוב‎ and ‏בוש ,יטב‎ and ‏סוך ,יבש‎ and
70", ete. In the latter case, it would be the exact refutation of David's previous
error. David would then say here, “Thou guidest my fate even to the lowliest
of the low; ic., “Whatever life brings me comes directly from Thee; no
Vv aspect of my fate on earth is so insignificant or lowly that Thou wouldst not
concern Thyself with it.”
V.6, ‏,חבלים גג"‎ The fate of man is formed from two components,
Vv ‏חבלים אשר ימלו לו‎ that which becomes his portion in life, be it sought after or
not, be it expected or unexpected, and, secondly, from nbn, from the content
7--- of the configuration of life which he enters into at birth as the inheritance
of his forebears and which gives him the basis upon which he will build bis
own life, He who will conceive of his growth and existence, of his entrance
