‘VY. 11. David tells the righteous: ‏.ישמה וגו'‎ “Even as your very
appearance and the obvious earnestness of your intentions will serve to drive
away the wicked, so will these same traits also serve to strengthen other

‎righteous men in their resolve to keep their own lives pure.” “The righteous‏ ש
‎man is filled with joy at the thought that you might unfold your full power‏
‎and thus put fear into the hearts of the wicked. He rejoices when be‏

‎‘foresees’ such retribution which will come if the wicked do not heed your‏ ש
‎warming.” mm preponderantly indicates a “seeing with the mind’s eye,” a‏
‎perception of that which is not yet visible to the physical organ of sight.‏
‎Since there is no place in this entire psalm that calls for a‏ .פעמיר ‎"a‏

‎nced not be interpreted in‏ דם ‎physical “killing” of the wicked, the word‏ ש
‎would denote the vengeance‏ דם ‎its literal meaning here. It is more likely that‏
‎(Lev, 19:16) expresses‏ לא העמוד על דם רעך 95 ‎threatening the wicked, even‏

‎Vv the danger threatening one’s fellow men. Likewise, ‏רחץ‎ as employed here
docs not indicate a “bathing” such as the bathing of feet, for “feet” would
be ‏רגליו‎ and not ayn, It is more likely that it would denote “keeping one’s

‎Vv steps pure.” The knowledge that it is indeed possible for human influence
to intervene and threaten the wicked man with uiter ruin sustains the
rightcous man in his resolve to “keep his own steps pure.”

‎Vv V. 12. ‏וגל‎ tox", “And men in general shall come to seo that it
is not idle folly ‘to be good.’ Righteousness can reap its reward even here

‎—_ on earth in the form of the approval and appreciation from human society,
— even as the wicked man can expect society to judge him and exact retribution
| from him during his own lifetime.”
