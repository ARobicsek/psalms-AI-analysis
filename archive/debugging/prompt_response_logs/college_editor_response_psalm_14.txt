### EDITORIAL ASSESSMENT

The current draft has some real strengths. It takes the Hebrew seriously, uses good lexical tools (like BDB), and notices important things: the movement from universal corruption to Zionic hope, the repeated “אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב,” and the tight relationship with Psalm 53. It also rightly stresses that “אָמַר נָבָל בְּלִבּוֹ אֵין אֱלֹהִים” is about practical godlessness, not modern philosophical atheism.

But for a first‑year college student, especially one with strong Hebrew, there are problems:

- The tone is too “dissertation-esque”: phrases like “masterclass in theological architecture” and “eschatological hope” pile up without being unpacked. Technical terms like *inclusio*, *chiasmus*, and “wish‑prayer formula” appear with little or no explanation.
- The commentary often tells you *that* something is brilliant instead of *showing* why, with close reading of the Hebrew.
- Some great material from the research bundle is underused:  
  • Torah Temimah’s link between Ps 14:1 and “אַחֲרֵי לְבַבְכֶם” (Berakhot 12b) is fascinating and never mentioned.  
  • Traditional readings that see Nebuchadnezzar, Titus, or Sennacherib behind the psalm are only lightly alluded to.  
  • Figurative “eating people” imagery has rich biblical parallels (e.g. Deut 7:16) that could be quoted in Hebrew and English.
- The liturgical section is vague (“not prominent”) and doesn’t actually show the Hebrew of prayers where related phrases occur.
- Psalm 53 is said to be a “twin,” but the implications of the different divine names and different book-positions in the Psalter are not spelled out.
- The macro questions raised by the analysts (e.g., “Who says עַמִּי?” “How do עָנִי / צַדִּיק / עַמִּי relate?”) are only partly answered.

In revision, the introduction needs to be less breathless, more conversational, and much clearer on basic terms. The verse‑by‑verse commentary should slow down over key Hebrew words and poetic moves, quote parallels, and keep explaining the “why”: why this verb, why this image, why this structure. And the liturgical use must be concrete: actual psalm and siddur lines in Hebrew and English, with a brief explanation of where and why they’re used.

### REVISED INTRODUCTION

### A quick map of what we’re reading

Psalm 14 is only seven verses long, but it does something surprisingly ambitious in that short space.

1. **Verses 1–3**: Start with one person—the “fool”—who says in his heart “אֵין אֱלֹהִים” (“There is no God”), then quickly expand that attitude into a sweeping verdict: *everyone* has turned aside, “אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב” (“there is no one who does good”).
2. **Verses 2–3**: God “looks down from heaven” to check whether that’s actually true. The result: depressingly, yes.
3. **Verses 4–6**: The camera zooms in. Instead of “all humanity” in the abstract, we now see specific evildoers devouring “עַמִּי” (“my people”) and mocking the “עָנִי” (“poor/lowly”) who trust in God.
4. **Verse 7**: The tone flips: “מִי־יִתֵּן מִצִּיּוֹן יְשׁוּעַת יִשְׂרָאֵל”—“O that deliverance for Israel might come from Zion!” The psalm ends not in despair but in a wish‑prayer for national restoration: “בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה שְׁבוּת עַמּוֹ יָגֵל יַעֲקֹב יִשְׂמַח יִשְׂרָאֵל.”

So you get a movement from **universal moral pessimism** to **particular hope for Israel from Zion**. That movement is the main “argument” of the poem.

### Who is the “fool,” and what does he mean by “no God”?

The key character is the נָבָל (*naval*). BDB (the Brown‑Driver‑Briggs Hebrew‑English Lexicon) glosses נָבָל as someone “foolish, senseless,” especially in a **moral and religious** sense. Think: not “low IQ,” but “ethically numb and spiritually tone‑deaf.”

You can see this elsewhere:

- Deut 32:6 scolds Israel:  
  “הַ־יְהוָה תִּגְמְלוּ־זֹאת עַם נָבָל וְלֹא חָכָם”  
  “Is this how you repay the LORD, O foolish and unwise people?”
- Isa 32:5 contrasts “נָבָל” with “נָדִיב” (a noble/generous person).

In 1 Sam 25, the man actually named Nabal is rich but mean, and his own wife says, “כִּשְׁמוֹ כֶּן הוּא; נָבָל שְׁמוֹ, וּנְבָלָה עִמּוֹ” — “As his name is, so is he; Nabal [‘Fool’] is his name, and folly is with him” (v. 25). Same idea.

So when Psalm 14 opens:

> אָמַר נָבָל בְּלִבּוֹ: אֵין אֱלֹהִים  
> “The fool says in his heart: ‘There is no God’”

we’re not in a modern atheist debate. The point is: in his *inner attitude* (בְּלִבּוֹ, “in his heart”), he lives as if there is **no effective divine judge**, no moral oversight. Torah Temimah, citing Berakhot 12b, links this with “אַחֲרֵי לְבַבְכֶם” in the Shema: “after your hearts” = heresy; “after your eyes” = sexual sin. The “fool” is the person whose *heart* quietly concludes, “No God that I need to reckon with.”

Other texts use the same language with this sense of “no God who matters”:

- Ps 10:4: “אֵין אֱלֹהִים כׇּל־מְזִמּוֹתָיו” — “All his schemes say: ‘There is no God [who will call me to account].’”
- 2 Kgs 1:3: Elijah asks the messengers of Ahaziah, “הֲמִבְּלִי אֵין־אֱלֹהִים בְּיִשְׂרָאֵל…?” — “Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal‑zebub?” Obviously he doesn’t mean literal atheism; he means, “You’re acting as if Israel’s God is irrelevant.”

That’s the nuance in Psalm 14: “No God (who matters for my behavior).” The rest of the psalm is basically God’s rebuttal to that attitude.

### From “everyone is corrupt” to “God is with the lowly”

Verses 1–3 pile up ugly verbs:

- “הִשְׁחִיתוּ” — “they have corrupted / ruined” (used in Gen 6:11–12 for the corruption of the earth before the Flood).
- “הִתְעִיבוּ עֲלִילָה” — “they have done something abominable / made their deeds disgusting.”
- “נֶאֱלָחוּ” (v. 3) — a rare verb probably meaning “become foul, rancid,” like spoiled food.

The picture is not “harmless little sins” but active rot. Verse 2 then imagines God “peeking down”:

> יְהוָה מִשָּׁמַיִם הִשְׁקִיף עַל־בְּנֵי־אָדָם  
> לִרְאוֹת הֲיֵשׁ מַשְׂכִּיל דֹּרֵשׁ אֶת־אֱלֹהִים׃  

The verb הִשְׁקִיף means “to look down from above” (used of God in Gen 19:28, Deut 26:15). God is scanning “בְּנֵי־אָדָם” (“human beings”) to find “מַשְׂכִּיל דֹּרֵשׁ אֶת־אֱלֹהִים” — “a wise/understanding person who seeks God.”

Notice the little symmetry (what people call “chiasm,” a mirror pattern):

- הֲיֵשׁ **מַשְׂכִּיל**  
- **דֹּרֵשׁ** אֶת־אֱלֹהִים

The “understanding one” is defined as the one who “seeks God.” Wisdom here is not IQ; it’s obedience and God‑seeking. But verse 3 answers with a harsh echo of verse 1: “אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב, אֵין גַּם־אֶחָד” — “There is no one who does good, not even one.”

Then the poem suddenly zooms in. Instead of “all humanity” in the clouds, we’re on the ground with a very specific crime:

> הֲלֹא יָדְעוּ כׇּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן  
> אֹכְלֵי עַמִּי אָכְלוּ לֶחֶם  
> יְהוָה לֹא קָרָאוּ׃ (v. 4)

“Workers of iniquity” (פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן) are “eating my people as they eat bread.” In biblical Hebrew, “to eat” (אָכַל) can be a metaphor for **destroying** someone:

- Deut 7:16: “וְאָכַלְתָּ אֶת־כׇּל־הָעַמִּים” — literally “you shall eat all the peoples,” meaning “wipe them out in battle.”
- Mic 3:3 accuses corrupt leaders: “וַאֲשֶׁר אָכְלוּ שְׁאֵר עַמִּי” — “who eat the flesh of my people.”

Here the exploiters “devour” Israel the way you casually chew bread—without a second thought. And the possessive “עַמִּי” (“my people”) strongly suggests we’re hearing **God’s** perspective, as many commentators (Rashi, Radak, Meiri) say: God is watching oppressors chew on “my people” and ignore me (“יְהוָה לֹא קָרָאוּ”).

Verse 5 then flips the emotional script:

> שָׁם פָּחֲדוּ פָחַד  
> כִּי־אֱלֹהִים בְּדוֹר צַדִּיק׃  

“שָׁם פָּחֲדוּ פָחַד” literally, “There they feared a fear.” The doubled root פ–ח–ד (פָּחֲדוּ פָחַד) makes a nice shuddering sound. The wicked, who felt zero fear while exploiting “my people,” suddenly panic when they realize “אֱלֹהִים בְּדוֹר צַדִּיק” — “God is in the generation (or circle) of the righteous.”

Then verse 6 contrasts two vantage points:

> עֲצַת עָנִי תָבִישׁוּ;  
> כִּי יְהוָה מַחְסֵהוּ׃  

“You shame the counsel of the poor, but the LORD is his refuge.”  

“עָנִי” is the poor/afflicted person, often a nickname in the Psalms for the **pious underclass** — people with no human power who cling to God (see Ps 34:7, 35:10). His “counsel” is his strategy: to take refuge (מַחֲסֶה, “shelter”) in God. The oppressors mock that plan as naïve. The psalm insists it’s actually the *only* good strategy, because God really does stand “in the circle of the righteous.”

So the big middle of the psalm (vv. 4–6) is: the same God who was supposedly “absent” (אֵין אֱלֹהִים) is in fact standing right in the middle of this despised, exploited little community.

### The surprise ending: a wish for Zion

Given all that, verse 7 could have gone dark: “Curse the fools; may they choke on their bread.” Instead we get:

> מִי־יִתֵּן מִצִּיּוֹן יְשׁוּעַת יִשְׂרָאֵל;  
> בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה שְׁבוּת עַמּוֹ,  
> יָגֵל יַעֲקֹב, יִשְׂמַח יִשְׂרָאֵל׃  

“מִי־יִתֵּן” is a standard Hebrew **wish formula** — literally “Who will give…?” but used as “Oh, that…!” You see it in Num 11:29:

> “וּמִי־יִתֵּן כׇּּל־עַם יְהוָה נְבִיאִים”  
> “O that all the LORD’s people were prophets!”

Here the wish is: “O that salvation for Israel would come from Zion!” “Zion” is not just a hill; it’s shorthand for **God’s presence dwelling with His people**, especially in the Temple. So the psalmist doesn’t just wish for things to “get better”; he wants **a restoration centered on God’s presence**.

“בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה שְׁבוּת עַמּוֹ” uses the idiom שׁוּב + שְׁבוּת. The noun שְׁבוּת can come from “captivity” (שׁבה) or “turning” (שׁוב); in practice it means “fortunes” or “state of affairs.” The phrase appears all over the Bible:

- Deut 30:3: “וְשָׁב יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ אֶת שְׁבוּתְךָ”  
- Job 42:10: “וַיהוָה שָׁב אֶת־שְׁבוּת אִיּוֹב”

So: “When the LORD restores the fortunes of His people” — when He flips their story — “Jacob will exult, Israel will rejoice.” The names “יַּעֲקֹב / יִשְׂרָאֵל” pile up affectionately, like saying “when Mom comes home, Sarah will dance, little Sarah will laugh.”

Theologically, that last verse answers the question, “Is the world just fools chewing on the righteous forever?” The answer is no: **God’s hidden presence with the lowly will eventually become a visible, public salvation from Zion.**

### Psalm 14 and its twin, Psalm 53

Psalm 53 is almost a copy‑paste of Psalm 14. The differences are tiny but interesting:

- Psalm 14 lives in **Book I** of the Psalter (Pss 1–41), which is heavy on the divine name יְהוָה.  
- Psalm 53 is in **Book II** (Pss 42–72), the “Elohistic Psalter,” where editors systematically prefer אֱלֹהִים. So in Ps 53 the same verses say “אֱלֹהִים מִשָּׁמַיִם הִשְׁקִיף…” and “בְּשׁוּב אֱלֹהִים שְׁבוּת עַמּוֹ…”
- Psalm 53 slightly tweaks some phrases (e.g. “מִצִּיּוֹן יְשֻׁעוֹת יִשְׂרָאֵל” — plural “deliverances”).

Traditional commentators often connect Ps 14 to specific historical crises (Nebuchadnezzar, Titus, Sennacherib), and Ps 53 to others. On a literary level, you can say the canon gives you the same poem twice, once with a very **covenantal** flavor (YHWH, Zion, Jacob, Israel) and once in a more **general “God” language**. That suggests the message is not tied to one moment; it’s a reusable prayer for any time God’s “fools” seem to be winning.

---LITURGICAL-SECTION-START---

#### Phrases

Even though Psalm 14 isn’t a star of the siddur the way Psalms 27 or 145 are, its vocabulary shows up in important places.

1. **כׇּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן – “all workers of iniquity”**

Our psalm:  
“הֲלֹא יָדְעוּ כׇּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן אֹכְלֵי עַמִּי…” (Ps 14:4) —  
“Are they so witless, all the workers of iniquity, who devour my people…?”

Very close wording reappears in **Psalm 92**, the psalm for Shabbat:

> “בִּפְרֹחַ רְשָׁעִים כְּמוֹ עֵשֶׂב,  
> וַיַּצִּיצוּ כׇּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן;  
> לְהִשָּׁמְדָם עֲדֵי־עַד.” (Ps 92:8)  
> “When the wicked sprout like grass, and all workers of iniquity blossom—it is for their destruction forever.”

Psalm 92 is recited **every Shabbat morning** as “מִזְמוֹר שִׁיר לְיוֹם הַשַּׁבָּת,” both in *Pesukei de‑Zimra* (verses of praise) and again as the Shabbat *Shir Shel Yom*. So each week, the congregation voices the idea behind Psalm 14: “workers of iniquity” may flourish for a moment, but God will judge.

2. **יִשְׂמַח יִשְׂרָאֵל – “Israel will rejoice”**

Our psalm ends:  
“יָגֵל יַעֲקֹב, יִשְׂמַח יִשְׂרָאֵל” — “Jacob will exult, Israel will rejoice” (14:7).

That exact pairing “יִשְׂמַח יִשְׂרָאֵל” appears in Psalm 149:2, which is said in *Pesukei de‑Zimra* daily:

> “יִשְׂמַח יִשְׂרָאֵל בְּעֹשָׂיו; בְּנֵי צִיּוֹן יָגִילוּ בְמַלְכָּם׃”  
> “Let Israel rejoice in its Maker; let the children of Zion exult in their King.”

When you recite Ps 149, you’re echoing Ps 14’s closing hope: Israel rejoicing in Zion because God has acted for them.

These liturgical echoes mean that, even if you never say Psalm 14 straight through in shul, you still sing its world: the contrast between “workers of iniquity” and the rejoicing of Israel in Zion shows up every week and every day.

### REVISED VERSE COMMENTARY

---

#### Verse 1

לַמְנַצֵּחַ לְדָוִד;  
אָמַר נָבָל בְּלִבּוֹ: אֵין אֱלֹהִים.  
הִשְׁחִיתוּ, הִתְעִיבוּ עֲלִילָה;  
אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב׃  

The heading לַמְנַצֵּחַ לְדָוִד (“For the leader; of David”) just tells us this is a Davidic psalm meant for public performance. The action starts immediately with a quote: “אָמַר נָבָל בְּלִבּוֹ: אֵין אֱלֹהִים” — “The fool says in his heart: ‘There is no God.’”

We already saw that נָבָל (naval) is not about brains but about **moral and spiritual stupidity**. Deut 32 and Isa 32 use it for people who ignore God’s gifts and obligations. In 1 Sam 25, Nabal’s behavior (stinginess, insult, refusal of hospitality) embodies this character: he lives as if “no God” will judge his actions.

“בְּלִבּוֹ” focuses on the **inner script**: he doesn’t loudly preach atheism; he quietly assumes there is no God whose opinion matters. Torah Temimah (on Berakhot 12b) notes how this lines up with “אַחֲרֵי לְבַבְכֶם” in the Shema: heresy begins as a “heart thing”—a silent attitude—before it ever becomes a philosophy.

The psalmist does something clever with perspective: after quoting the fool, he suddenly shifts to “they”:

> הִשְׁחִיתוּ, הִתְעִיבוּ עֲלִילָה;  
> אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב.

“He *they* have corrupted, they have done abominable deeds; there is none who does good.” The singular fool has many clones. The verbs are strong:

- הִשְׁחִיתוּ (from שׁחת) — to ruin, corrupt, destroy. This is the verb used in Gen 6:12: “כִּי־הִשְׁחִית כׇּּל־בָּשָׂר אֶת־דַּרְכּוֹ” — “for all flesh had corrupted its way.”
- הִתְעִיבוּ (from תָּעַב) — to make something abominable or disgusting. Job 15:16 calls the wicked man “נִתְעָב וְנֶאֱלָח” — “abhorred and foul.”

So the line “they have corrupted, they have made their deeds abominable” says: a heart that says “no God” doesn’t stay neutral; it **leaks out** into disgusting behavior.

Then the last colon: “אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב” — “there is no one who does good.” This is intentionally exaggerated (you and the psalmist both know not literally **no one** ever does any good). But as hyperbole it makes the point: from God’s vantage point, human society is so shot through with injustice that, on the macro level, “no one” is clean.

Notice how “אֵין” (“there is no…”) appears twice in the verse:

- “אֵין אֱלֹהִים” — “no God” (in the fool’s mind).
- “אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב” — “no one doing good” (God’s verdict).

It’s almost like a twisted exchange: *You* say “no God”; *I* say “no goodness.” The psalm will now test whether that’s really so.

---

#### Verse 2

יְהוָה מִשָּׁמַיִם הִשְׁקִיף עַל־בְּנֵי־אָדָם;  
לִרְאוֹת הֲיֵשׁ מַשְׂכִּיל, דֹּרֵשׁ אֶת־אֱלֹהִים׃  

Here the perspective flips from the fool’s heart to God’s eye. “יְהוָה מִשָּׁמַיִם הִשְׁקִיף” — “The LORD, from heaven, looked down.” The verb הִשְׁקִיף, as BDB notes, is used when someone leans out from a high place and looks down (Judg 5:28, Deut 26:15). It paints a vivid image: God bends over the balcony of heaven to examine human life.

He’s looking “עַל־בְּנֵי־אָדָם” — “upon the children of Adam,” i.e., people in general. But what is He searching for?

> “לִרְאוֹת הֲיֵשׁ מַשְׂכִּיל, דֹּרֵשׁ אֶת־אֱלֹהִים”

“To see whether there is a **maśkil**, one who has understanding, who seeks God (דֹּרֵשׁ אֶת־אֱלֹהִים).”

The noun מַשְׂכִּיל comes from the root שׂכל (to be wise, prudent, act insightfully). It’s the same root as the title “מַשְׂכִּיל” used for didactic psalms. Here, though, it’s not about intellectual analysis; the parallelism shows what wisdom means:

- מַשְׂכִּיל (“one who understands”)  
- דֹּרֵשׁ אֶת־אֱלֹהִים (“one who seeks God”)

That’s a textbook example of **synonymous parallelism**: the second phrase restates and sharpens the first. It quietly defines “wisdom” as **seeking God**, not just knowing many things. The mini‑chiasm (A = wise person, B = seek God) helps link the two ideas tightly.

This verse also corrects the fool’s theology. The fool’s inner monologue: “No God, nobody’s watching.” Verse 2: actually, the LORD is watching very closely. He is not distant; He is inspecting.

One more subtlety: the psalm uses יְהוָה here rather than generic אֱלֹהִים. That’s the **covenant name**, the God of Israel’s history. In Psalm 53 (the “twin”), this line becomes “אֱלֹהִים מִשָּׁמַיִם הִשְׁקִיף” to match that book’s style. Here in Psalm 14, we’re reminded that the God who is looking is not just “a god,” but the same God who brought Israel out of Egypt and into covenant—so what He sees in human injustice matters deeply.

---

#### Verse 3

הַכֹּל סָר; יַחְדָּו נֶאֱלָחוּ;  
אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב, אֵין גַּם־אֶחָד׃  

Verse 3 gives God’s answer to His own search—and it’s grim. “הַכֹּל סָר” — “All have turned aside.” The verb סָר can mean “turn aside, stray” from a path. It echoes Isa 53:6, “כֻּלָּנוּ כַּצֹּאן תָּעִינוּ; אִישׁ לְדַרְכּוֹ פָּנִינוּ” — “All we like sheep have gone astray; each has turned to his own way.”

“יַחְדָּו נֶאֱלָחוּ” adds a rarer verb: נֶאֱלָחוּ (from אָלַח). BDB glosses it as “be corrupt, tainted, turned foul,” possibly like milk turning sour. The pairing is vivid: they have left the road **and** their character has gone off, like food spoiling.

Again we hit the refrain:

> “אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב, אֵין גַּם־אֶחָד.”

“There is none who does good; there is not even one.”

Notice the structure:

- Opening verdict in v. 1: “אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב”  
- Repeated and intensified in v. 3: “אֵין עֹשֵׂה־טוֹב, אֵין גַּם־אֶחָד.”

This repetition forms a kind of **inclusio** (an “envelope” structure) around the opening diagnosis (vv. 1–3). We start and end the section with the same devastating line, now upgraded with “גַּם־אֶחָד” (“not even one”) to sound even more total.

Is the psalm claiming that literally every single human everywhere is equally wicked? In the Psalms themselves, no—there are also צַדִּיקִים (“righteous”), עֲנָוִים (“humble”), חַסִידִים (“faithful”), etc. This verse is **rhetorical**: from the standpoint of justice, society as a whole is crooked. No class or group can say, “We’re the good guys, totally clean.” Later, verse 5 will still be able to speak of a “דּוֹר צַדִּיק,” a generation of the righteous, so clearly the hyperbole is part of the psalm’s emotional punch, not a flat theological treatise.

The Greek Septuagint (LXX) of this verse is huge—it imports extra lines that Paul later quotes in Romans 3 (“their throat is an open grave; with their tongues they have practiced deceit… there is no fear of God before their eyes”). Those expansions are early Christian commentary layered onto the psalm, not part of the Hebrew text, but they show how strongly this “no one does good” line resonated as a picture of human sin.

#### Verse 4

הֲלֹא יָדְעוּ כׇּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן;  
אֹכְלֵי עַמִּי, אָכְלוּ לֶחֶם;  
יְהוָה לֹא קָרָאוּ׃  

Here the poem turns from God’s verdict to a kind of astonished protest: “הֲלֹא יָדְעוּ…?” — “Do they really not know…?” The people in question are “כׇּל־פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן” — “all the workers of trouble/iniquity.” The noun אָוֶן covers both **trouble** and **wickedness**; it’s what the wicked “sow” and then “reap” (Prov 22:8).

What have they done?

> “אֹכְלֵי עַמִּי, אָכְלוּ לֶחֶם”

Literally: “those who eat my people—they have eaten bread.” It sounds weird in English; in Hebrew the idea is: they devour my people **as casually as** they eat bread. This is classic biblical metaphor: eating = **consuming, destroying, exploiting.** Compare:

- Deut 7:16: “וְאָכַלְתָּ אֶת־כׇּל־הָעַמִּים אֲשֶׁר יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ נֹתֵן לָךְ”  
  “You shall eat all the peoples that the LORD your God gives you” — meaning, conquer and wipe them out.
- Mic 3:3: corrupt leaders “וְאָכְלוּ אֵת בְּשַׂר עַמִּי” — “they eat the flesh of my people.”

Here the “eating” is likely social/economic: treating people as resources to chew up: labor, taxes, land grabs, even violent oppression.

Who is speaking when we hear “עַמִּי” (“my people”)? Traditional Jewish commentators mostly take this as **God’s voice**: God calls Israel “עַמִּי” all over the prophets, and verse 7 will explicitly mention “עַמּוֹ” (“His people”). So the verse is probably either (a) God speaking in the first person, or (b) the psalmist speaking *on God’s behalf*, seeing the world from God’s perspective.

The last colon clinches the diagnosis:

> “יְהוָה לֹא קָרָאוּ” — “The LORD they have not called upon.”

They exploit “my people” *and* they ignore me. No prayer, no seeking, no sense that YHWH has any claim on them. That double move—abusing the weak while erasing God—is what makes them “נָבָל.”

Psalm 53:5 has the same verse but swaps “אֱלֹהִים” for “יְהוָה”:

> “…אָכְלוּ לֶחֶם; אֱלֹהִים לֹא קָרָאוּ׃”

So our psalm ties the crime more tightly to the covenant God of Israel (YHWH), fitting its focus on “עַמִּי” and “צִיּוֹן.”

---

#### Verse 5

שָׁם פָּחֲדוּ פָחַד;  
כִּי־אֱלֹהִים בְּדוֹר צַדִּיק׃  

“שָׁם” (“there”) is deliciously vague: *right there*, at the very place and moment where the oppressors felt totally secure eating God’s people like bread—that’s where “פָּחֲדוּ פָחַד,” “they feared a fear.” The phrase is both a little poetic flourish and a sound effect: the doubled פ–ח–ד (פָּחֲדוּ פָחַד) gives you a kind of stuttering, like someone’s heartbeat jumping.

Psalm 53:6 expands it to “שָׁם פָּחֲדוּ פַחַד לֹא־הָיָה פָחַד” — “There they feared a fear where there was no fear,” emphasizing how irrational and sudden the panic is. Our Psalm 14 stays tighter.

Why the fear?

> “כִּי־אֱלֹהִים בְּדוֹר צַדִּיק”

“Because God is in the generation (or circle) of the righteous.”

“דּוֹר צַדִּיק” can mean either “era of righteous people” or “company of the righteous.” Either way, the idea is: even when the righteous look marginal and powerless (the “עָנִי” of v. 6), **God is present in their midst.** The wicked suddenly realize that the God they wrote off as “אֵין אֱלֹהִים” is *right there* in the community they were trampling.

So you get a strong contrast:

- To the oppressed, God is “מַחְסֵהוּ” (“his refuge,” v. 6) — a shelter.
- To the oppressors, the same presence is sheer terror — the realization that they have picked a fight with the wrong people.

You can compare this to 1 Sam 5: the Philistines capture the Ark, park it in their temple, and then panic as plagues hit them. The presence of Israel’s God turns from a trophy into a nightmare.

Theologically, this verse is the **turning point** of the psalm. It hints that the “no one does good” of verses 1–3 is not the *last word*: there *is* a “דור צדיק,” and God is there. That’s what makes the final prayer for Zion in verse 7 plausible instead of wishful thinking.

---

#### Verse 6

עֲצַת־עָנִי תָבִישׁוּ;  
כִּי יְהוָה מַחְסֵהוּ׃  

This verse is compact, but it’s the theological heart of the psalm. The structure is a classic **antithetic parallelism**: two lines that contrast:

- “עֲצַת־עָנִי תָבִישׁוּ” — “You shame / mock the counsel of the poor.”
- “כִּי יְהוָה מַחְסֵהוּ” — “For the LORD is his refuge.”

“עָנִי” is the poor, afflicted, humble person. In Psalms it often functions as a code‑name for the **faithful remnant** whose only security is God (see Ps 40:18, 86:1). His “עֵצָה” (“counsel, plan”) is his life strategy. And that plan is: “יְהוָה מַחְסֵהוּ” — “The LORD is his refuge.”

The wicked “תָבִישׁוּ” (put to shame, ridicule) that counsel: “Trust God? That’s your big plan? Good luck with that.” Radak paraphrases their taunt as the ancient version of “איה אלהיכם?” — “Where is your God?” (cf. Deut 32:37–38).

But the psalmist reverses the evaluation: that despised strategy is actually the only solid one. “מַחְסֶה” means “shelter, refuge,” used for rocks, caves, and God Himself:

- Ps 46:2: “אֱלֹהִים לָנוּ מַחֲסֶה וָעֹז” — “God is for us a refuge and strength.”
- Ps 91:2: “אֹמַר לַיהוָה: מַחְסִּי וּמְצוּדָתִי” — “I say to the LORD: my refuge and my fortress.”

So this line quietly defines what it means to be the “דור צדיק” (v. 5): the righteous/poor are those who consciously choose God as their only shelter, even when that looks foolish.

This verse also tightens the web of terms:

- עַמִּי (“my people,” v. 4) — the community being eaten.
- דּוֹר צַדִּיק (“circle of the righteous,” v. 5) — the same community, seen from God’s perspective.
- עָנִי (“poor,” v. 6) — the individual member of that community on the ground.

They’re three lenses on the same group: **God’s people / the righteous / the poor.** The wicked see “עָנִי”; God sees “צַדִּיק” and “עַמִּי.”

#### Verse 7

מִי־יִתֵּן מִצִּיּוֹן יְשׁוּעַת יִשְׂרָאֵל;  
בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה שְׁבוּת עַמּוֹ,  
יָגֵל יַעֲקֹב, יִשְׂמַח יִשְׂרָאֵל׃  

This final verse is a surprise twist. After all the grim analysis, we suddenly get a sighing wish: “מִי־יִתֵּן מִצִּיּוֹן יְשׁוּעַת יִשְׂרָאֵל” — “O that from Zion would come the salvation of Israel!”

“מִי־יִתֵּן” (“Who will give…?”) is a **wish‑formula**; we’d say “If only…!” in English. You saw it in Job 14:13 (“מִי יִתֵּן בִּשְׁאוֹל תַּצְפִּנֵנִי” — “O that You would hide me in Sheol”) and Deut 5:26 (“מִי־יִתֵּן וְהָיָה לְבָבָם זֶה לָהֶם” — “If only their heart would remain this way…”).

The wish is specifically for **salvation “from Zion”**. Zion = Jerusalem, especially the Temple mount, the symbolic place where God’s presence dwells. To wish for “ישועת ישראל” *from Zion* is to say: we don’t just want military success; we want a salvation that flows from God’s own dwelling and vindicates His people as *His*.

The second half fleshes this out:

> “בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה שְׁבוּת עַמּוֹ”  
> “When the LORD restores the fortunes of His people…”

As noted above, “שְׁבוּת” (from either שׁוב or שׁבה) is an idiom meaning “fortunes” or “state.” The Bible uses “לְשׁוּב שְׁבוּת” repeatedly for a big turn‑around:

- Jer 29:14: “וְשַׁבְתִּי אֶת־שְׁבוּתְכֶם” — “I will restore your fortunes.”
- Ps 126:1: “בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה אֶת־שִׁיבַת צִיּוֹן הָיִינוּ כְּחֹלְמִים” — “When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like dreamers.”

Our verse is structurally very close to Ps 126: both imagine a future “when the LORD restores” that will feel too good to be true. The ending:

> “יָגֵל יַעֲקֹב, יִשְׂמַח יִשְׂרָאֵל”

Pairs the two names of the patriarch (Jacob/Israel) for poetic warmth and fullness: the whole people, under both their names, will rejoice.

One more layer: in Psalm 53:7, the same verse reads:

> “מִי־יִתֵּן מִצִּיּוֹן יְשֻׁעוֹת יִשְׂרָאֵל; בְּשׁוּב אֱלֹהִים שְׁבוּת עַמּוֹ…”

There it’s “אֱלֹהִים” instead of “יְהוָה,” and “ישֻׁעוֹת” (plural “deliverances”). In our psalm, the use of יְהוָה and the Zion language anchor the hope more explicitly in the **national covenant story**—the God of Zion restoring His special people.

So the psalm, which began with “אֵין אֱלֹהִים” (“no God”) ends with “בְּשׁוּב יְהוָה שְׁבוּת עַמּוֹ” (“when the LORD restores the fortunes of His people”). The fool’s heart said, “No God, no judge.” The psalmist’s heart ends by betting everything on the opposite: there *is* a God, He *does* identify with “my people” and the “poor,” and from Zion He will eventually write a very different story.
