### INTRODUCTION ESSAY (for review)
# Introduction to Psalm 10

Psalm 10 presents readers with an interpretive puzzle that begins with its very structure. The ancient tradition preserved in the Septuagint combined it with Psalm 9 as a single composition, and with good reason: together they form a broken acrostic poem whose letters span both psalms yet leave conspicuous gaps where key stanzas should be. This structural fracture is not accidental. The missing acrostic lines—particularly the absence of a complete ע (*ayin*) stanza in a poem about the עָנִי (*ani*, the afflicted)—enact what the psalm describes: a world where divine order seems incomplete, where the alphabet of justice stutters and fails. If Psalm 9 celebrates God's past victories over nations, Psalm 10 confronts the present crisis of God's apparent absence while wickedness flourishes. The broken acrostic thus becomes a formal theodicy, its very incompleteness mirroring the theological problem it addresses.

The psalm's opening question, "לָמָ֣ה יְ֭הֹוָה תַּעֲמֹ֣ד בְּרָח֑וֹק תַּ֝עְלִ֗ים לְעִתּ֥וֹת בַּצָּרָֽה" ("Why, O LORD, do You stand aloof, heedless in times of trouble?"), establishes a spatial theology that structures the entire composition. God stands "at a distance" (*be-rachoq*); His judgments are "high" (*marom*) and "removed" (*mi-negdo*) from the wicked (v. 5); He has "hidden His face" (*histir panav*, v. 11). Yet this spatial language does not merely describe divine absence—it maps the psychological terrain of abandonment. The verb עָמַד (*amad*, "to stand") typically connotes stability and presence, as in God standing to judge (Ps 82:1) or the priest standing before God (Deut 10:8). Here it acquires an ominous passivity: God stands, but far off, frozen in a posture that suggests both presence and paralysis. This tension between God's seeming inaction and His ultimate sovereignty drives the psalm's theological argument.

The centerpiece of the psalm is not the psalmist's complaint but the unprecedented psychological portrait of the wicked. Through three interior monologues introduced by the formula "אָמַ֣ר בְּלִבּוֹ" ("he says in his heart," vv. 6, 11, 13), the poet exposes the wicked's theological corruption. These quotations reveal a progression of practical atheism: first, the confident assertion "בַּל־אֶמּ֑וֹט לְדֹ֥ר וָ֝דֹ֗ר אֲשֶׁ֣ר לֹֽא־בְרָֽע" ("I shall not be shaken, through all time never be in trouble," v. 6); then the theological conclusion "שָׁ֣כַֽח אֵ֑ל הִסְתִּ֥יר פָּ֝נָ֗יו בַּל־רָאָ֥ה לָנֶֽצַח" ("God has forgotten, He hides His face, He never looks," v. 11); finally, the explicit denial "לֹ֣א תִדְרֹֽשׁ" ("You do not call to account," v. 13). This is the language of theodicy turned inside out: the wicked arrives at the same conclusion as the suffering psalmist—God does not see, does not act—but draws the opposite implication. Where the psalmist protests divine hiddenness, the wicked exploits it. The formula itself, "says in his heart," echoes Psalm 14:1's "אָ֘מַ֤ר נָבָ֣ל בְּלִבּוֹ אֵ֣ין אֱלֹהִ֑ים" ("The benighted man thinks, 'God does not care'"), establishing a typology of practical atheism across the Psalter.

What makes these monologues striking is their accuracy. The wicked's theology of divine absence mirrors precisely the psalm's opening lament. Both the righteous and the wicked agree on the empirical reality—God appears hidden—but their responses diverge radically. The wicked interprets absence as permission; the psalmist interprets it as a theological crisis demanding resolution. This convergence is the psalm's central irony: the very hiddenness that torments the faithful emboldens the wicked. The verb דָּרַשׁ (*darash*) becomes the hinge of this ironic reversal. The wicked declares "בַּל־יִדְרֹ֑שׁ" ("He does not seek," v. 4) and "לֹ֣א תִדְרֹֽשׁ" ("You do not call to account," v. 13), but the psalmist turns this same verb against him: "תִּֽדְרוֹשׁ־רִשְׁע֥וֹ בַל־תִּמְצָֽא" ("seek his wickedness until You find it no more," v. 15). Divine seeking (*derisha*) will ultimately prove the wicked's negation false.

The extended predator imagery (vv. 8-10) translates theological abstraction into visceral threat. The wicked man "יֵשֵׁ֤ב ׀ בְּמַאְרַ֬ב חֲצֵרִ֗ים בַּֽ֭מִּסְתָּרִים יַהֲרֹ֣ג נָקִ֑י" ("sits in ambush of villages, in secret places kills the innocent," v. 8). The verb יֵשֵׁב (*yoshev*, "sits") creates a spatial parallel to God's distant "standing"—where God stands aloof, the wicked sits in ambush. The mixed metaphors that follow—lion in lair (כְּאַרְיֵ֬ה בְסֻכֹּ֗ה, v. 9), hunter with net (בְּמׇשְׁכ֥וֹ בְרִשְׁתּֽוֹ, v. 9)—compound the sense of threat through metaphorical layering rather than precision. This is calculated violence: "עֵ֝ינָ֗יו לְֽחֵלְכָ֥ה יִצְפֹּֽנוּ" ("his eyes spy on the helpless," v. 8). The predator watches, waits, strikes—a pattern that inverts pastoral imagery where God watches over His flock. Here, in God's apparent absence, other predators fill the vacuum.

The psalm's theological resolution arrives not through a change in circumstances but through a shift in perception. The pivotal verse 14 opens with a fronted verb that shatters the wicked's theology: "רָאִ֡תָה כִּי־אַתָּ֤ה ׀ עָ֘מָ֤ל וָכַ֨עַס ׀ תַּבִּיט֮" ("You DO look! For You [behold] mischief and vexation"). The emphatic structure—a perfect tense verb beginning the colon—asserts accomplished reality against the wicked's denials. This is not a plea for future intervention but an affirmation of present vision. God has been looking all along. The shift from imperfect verbs in the lament (תַּעֲמֹד, תַּעְלִים) to perfect verbs in the resolution (רָאִתָה, שָׁמַעְתָּ, v. 17) marks the psalm's rhetorical strategy: the very act of prayer contradicts the claim of divine absence. To petition an absent God is to affirm His presence.

The sudden intrusion of the kingship declaration "יְהֹוָ֣ה מֶ֭לֶךְ עוֹלָ֣ם וָעֶ֑ד אָבְד֥וּ ג֝וֹיִ֗ם מֵאַרְצֽוֹ" ("The LORD is king forever and ever; the nations will perish from His land," v. 16) shifts registers from petition to proclamation. This is not logical argument but liturgical assertion—what speech-act theory would call a "performative utterance" that creates reality through declaration. By speaking God's kingship, the psalmist invokes the cosmic order that the wicked's success had seemed to deny. The perfect verb אָבְדוּ ("have perished") reads as prophetic certainty, collapsing future judgment into present reality through grammatical force. This liturgical strategy—asserting divine kingship in the face of its apparent absence—became central to Jewish prayer, where the phrase appears in the daily *Pesukei Dezimra* of Sefardic rites as part of *Yehi Khvod*, immediately following the threefold declaration of God's reign over past, present, and future: "יְהֹוָה מֶֽלֶךְ, יְהֹוָה מָלָךְ, יְהֹוָה יִמְלֹךְ לְעֹלָם וָעֶד: יְהֹוָה מֶֽלֶךְ עוֹלָם וָעֶד אָבְדוּ גוֹיִם מֵאַרְצוֹ" ("The LORD is King, the LORD was King, the LORD will be King forever and ever; The LORD is King for ever and ever; nations have perished from His land"). By placing our verse as the fourth in this sequence, the liturgy reads Psalm 10:16 as the culmination of the kingship theme, affirming that God's sovereignty proves itself precisely by the elimination of earthly powers that challenged it.

The final plea "לִשְׁפֹּ֥ט יָת֗וֹם וָ֫דָ֥ךְ בַּל־יוֹסִ֥יף ע֑וֹד לַעֲרֹ֥ץ אֱ֝נ֗וֹשׁ מִן־הָאָֽרֶץ" ("to champion the orphan and the downtrodden, that men who are of the earth tyrannize no more," v. 18) returns to Torah's covenant categories. The orphan (יָתוֹם) appears throughout Israel's legal tradition as the paradigmatic vulnerable figure whom God particularly defends (Exod 22:21-23; Deut 10:18). The phrase אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָֽרֶץ ("man from the earth") emphasizes human mortality and earthly limitation in contrast to God's eternal kingship just declared. The verb לַעֲרֹץ ("to terrify") closes the circle: where the opening portrayed a terrorized community before a predatory wicked man, the ending envisions that terror's abolition. The temporal phrase בַּל־יוֹסִ֥יף ע֑וֹד ("no longer," "no more") marks the eschatological horizon—not a return to an idealized past but a movement toward a future where oppression has ceased.

Psalm 10 thus offers not a philosophical resolution to theodicy but a rhetorical one. The psalm does not explain why God appears hidden; it demonstrates that the very possibility of protest, petition, and proclamation contradicts the wicked's claim that God does not see. By moving from spatial complaint through psychological exposure to liturgical assertion, the psalm transforms the question "Why do You stand aloof?" into the affirmation "You are king forever." This is theodicy through doxology—suffering acknowledged, wickedness anatomized, divine sovereignty proclaimed. The broken acrostic, with its missing stanzas, remains broken. But the psalm argues that even incomplete alphabets can spell justice, and even distant kings can hear the cry of the afflicted.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

While Psalm 10 is not recited in its entirety as part of the fixed Jewish liturgy, specific verses and phrases from the psalm have been strategically incorporated into prayer at moments of profound theological significance. Most notably, verse 16's declaration of divine kingship, "יְהֹוָ֣ה מֶ֭לֶךְ עוֹלָ֣ם וָעֶ֑ד אָבְד֥וּ ג֝וֹיִ֗ם מֵאַרְצֽוֹ" ("The LORD is king forever and ever; the nations will perish from His land"), holds a stable position in the *Pesukei Dezimra* of the Sefardic and Mizrachi rites for all Shacharit services. It appears as part of *Yehi Khvod*, a curated collection of verses celebrating divine majesty. The liturgy places it as the climactic fourth element in a sequence that begins with the threefold temporal declaration "יְהֹוָה מֶֽלֶךְ, יְהֹוָה מָלָךְ, יְהֹוָה יִמְלֹךְ לְעֹלָם וָעֶד" ("The LORD is King, the LORD was King, the LORD will be King forever and ever"), then continues with our verse, followed by "יְהֹוָה הֵפִיר עֲצַת־גּוֹיִם הֵנִיא מַחְשְׁבוֹת עַמִּים" ("The LORD foils the counsel of nations"). This strategic placement transforms Psalm 10:16 from a declaration arising from theodicy into a liturgical assertion of God's triumph over earthly powers—reading it not as desperate hope but as accomplished reality.

Individual phrases also appear at moments of intense supplication. The petition "תָּכִין לִבָּם תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ" ("Prepare their heart; incline Your ear," v. 17) appears in High Holiday liturgy during the chazan's repetition of the Amidah in both Ashkenazi and Edot HaMizrach traditions. The prayer leader, feeling unworthy, shifts focus from his own merit to God's power to prepare hearts for prayer: "לְחַלּוֹתְךָ שְׁלָחֽוּנִי מַקְהֲלוֹת הֲמוֹנֶֽךָ. תָּכִין לִבָּם תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶֽךָ" ("Your teeming congregations have sent me to entreat You. Prepare their heart; incline Your ear"). This liturgical usage extracts the verse from its original context of divine vindication and reimagines it as a plea for the inner preparation necessary for genuine prayer. The phrase also appears in the Edot HaMizrach Simchat Torah *Hakafot*, where it is recited during the first circuit, associated kabbalistically with the divine attribute of *Malkhut* (Kingship), embedded in a longer liturgical sequence: "וַאֲנִי כְּזַיִת רַעֲנָן בְּבֵית אֱלֹהִים, בָּטַחְתִּי בְּחֶסֶד אֱלֹהִים עוֹלָם וָעֶד. תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים שָׁמַעְתָּ יְהֹוָה, תָּכִין לִבָּם תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ" ("But I am

**Verse 1**

לָמָ֣ה יְ֭הֹוָה תַּעֲמֹ֣ד בְּרָח֑וֹק; תַּ֝עְלִ֗ים לְעִתּ֥וֹת בַּצָּרָֽה׃

"Why, O LORD, do You stand aloof; why do You hide in times of trouble?"

The psalm erupts with a double rhetorical question (לָמָה...לָמָה), a pattern that appears at moments of acute theological crisis throughout the Psalter (cf. Ps 22:2, 44:24-25). The repetition of the interrogative creates an urgent, almost accusatory tone that will pervade the first half of the psalm. What makes this opening particularly striking is its spatial theology: God is depicted as "standing at a distance" (תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָחוֹק) and "hiding" (תַּעְלִים). The verb עָמַד typically connotes presence and stability—God "stands" to judge (Ps 82:1), to help (Ps 109:31)—but here it acquires an ominous passivity through the prepositional phrase בְּרָחוֹק. The psalmist is not complaining that God is absent, but that He is present yet distant, watching from afar like a bystander. 

The second colon intensifies this complaint with תַּעְלִים, from the root עלם (to hide, conceal). This verb often describes divine hiddenness as an act of judgment or withdrawal (cf. Deut 31:17-18: הִסְתַּרְתִּי פָנַי מֵהֶם, "I will hide My face from them"). But here the hiddenness is temporally specific: לְעִתּוֹת בַּצָּרָֽה, "in times of trouble." God hides precisely when He is most needed. The phrase appears verbatim in Psalm 9:10 (עֶזְרָה בַּצָּרוֹת, "help in times of trouble"), suggesting these two psalms function as a theological diptych, with Psalm 9 celebrating God's past interventions and Psalm 10 lamenting His present absence.

Medieval commentators struggled with the theodicy this verse presents. Rashi reads the complaint through Israel's historical experience: God's apparent passivity enables Amalek (identified with the "wicked" throughout) to prosper. Ibn Ezra, characteristically rationalist, suggests that the verse reflects human perception rather than divine reality—God's "distance" is a function of human inability to discern providence. The verb's imperfect tense (תַּעֲמֹד, תַּעְלִים) may indicate continuous or habitual action: "Why do You keep standing aloof?" This grammatical nuance suggests not a one-time abandonment but an ongoing pattern of apparent divine inaction that torments the faithful.

The spatial metaphor here sets up what becomes the psalm's central irony: both the psalmist and the wicked (v. 11) agree that God is hidden. Their responses to this shared perception diverge radically—the wicked exploit divine absence, while the psalmist protests it. This opening verse thus introduces the psalm's core theological problem: how to maintain faith when God appears to be standing aloof, watching from a distance while wickedness flourishes.

**Verse 2**

בְּגַאֲוַ֣ת רָ֭שָׁע יִדְלַ֣ק עָנִ֑י; יִתָּפְשׂ֓וּ ׀ בִּמְזִמּ֖וֹת ז֣וּ חָשָֽׁבוּ׃

"In the arrogance of the wicked, the poor is hotly pursued; may they be caught in the schemes they have devised."

This verse introduces the wicked (רָשָׁע) and his victim (עָנִי) while establishing the psalm's first major theme: the causal relationship between theological arrogance and social violence. The opening phrase בְּגַאֲוַת רָשָׁע functions as an explanatory bet—"because of" or "through the arrogance of the wicked"—making pride the engine of oppression. The noun גַּאֲוָה (arrogance, pride) appears only seven times in Psalms, predominantly in contexts describing the wicked's haughty posture toward both God and humanity (cf. Ps 31:19, 73:6).

The verb יִדְלַק is particularly vivid: from the root דלק (to burn, pursue hotly), it suggests passionate, relentless hunting. Ibn Ezra glosses it correctly as "he pursues" (יִרְדֹּף), citing Genesis 31:36: כִּי דָלַקְתָּ אַחֲרָי, "that you pursued me hotly." The imperfect tense conveys ongoing action—not a single attack but continuous predation. The object of this burning pursuit is עָנִי (the poor, afflicted), the first of five different Hebrew terms for victims in this psalm (עָנִי, חֵלְכָה, נָקִי, יָתוֹם, דָּךְ). This lexical variety prevents the reader from abstracting the oppression into a single category—the wicked prey on the vulnerable in all their forms.

The second colon shifts abruptly to a jussive or passive construction: יִתָּפְשׂוּ בִּמְזִמּוֹת זוּ חָשָׁבוּ, "may they be caught in the schemes which they have devised." This is the psalm's first prayer for retributive justice—let the wicked fall into their own traps. The phrase זוּ חָשָׁבוּ (literally "this they plotted") uses the demonstrative זוּ (an archaic form of זֹאת, "this"), which also appears in Psalm 31:5 and 32:6, suggesting the psalmist is drawing on older poetic diction. The verb חָשַׁב (to think, devise) will recur in verse 4, emphasizing that the wicked's violence is not impulsive but calculated—he "thinks" his way into evil (מְזִמּוֹת, "schemes," from the root זמם, to plot).

Radak notes the psalm's rhetorical strategy here: after describing the wicked's actions, the psalmist interrupts with a curse (יִתָּפְשׂוּ). This creates a pattern of description followed by imprecation that will structure much of the psalm. The traditional commentators debated whether this prayer for the wicked to be "caught" expresses hope for their repentance (they will see the consequences of their schemes and turn) or simple retribution (measure-for-measure justice). The Torah Temimah does not cite this verse, but the principle of middah ke-neged middah (measure for measure) pervades rabbinic thought on divine justice—the appropriate punishment for the schemer is to be ensnared by his own plots (cf. Esther's reversal of Haman's scheme).

**Verse 3**

כִּֽי־הִלֵּ֣ל רָ֭שָׁע עַל־תַּאֲוַ֣ת נַפְשׁ֑וֹ; וּבֹצֵ֥עַ בֵּ֝רֵ֗ךְ נִ֘אֵ֥ץ ׀ יְהֹוָֽה׃

"For the wicked boasts about his soul's desire; and the greedy one blesses himself, scorning the LORD."

This verse provides the כִּי ("for") explanation of why the wicked deserves to be caught in his own schemes: his arrogance extends from social violence (v. 2) to theological rebellion. The opening phrase כִּֽי־הִלֵּ֣ל רָ֭שָׁע עַל־תַּאֲוַ֣ת נַפְשׁ֑וֹ is unusual—the verb הִלֵּל (to praise, boast) typically takes a direct object (one praises *something*), but here it takes the preposition עַל, creating the sense of "boasting *about* his soul's desire." Rashi reads this as the wicked man's self-congratulation: he boasts that he achieves all his desires (כׇּל תַּאֲוַת נַפְשׁוֹ), suggesting his success breeds further arrogance.

The phrase תַּאֲוַת נַפְשׁוֹ (literally "the desire of his soul") is particularly striking. The noun נֶפֶשׁ can mean "throat" (its etymological root) as well as "soul" or "life-force," creating an implied image of appetite—the wicked's soul has a "throat" that constantly desires. This same noun appears in verse 17 where God hears תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים, "the desire of the lowly," creating a deliberate contrast: the wicked boast about their desires; the humble's desires are heard by God.

The second colon introduces one of the psalm's most shocking phrases: וּבֹצֵ֥עַ בֵּ֝רֵ֗ךְ נִ֘אֵ֥ץ ׀ יְהֹוָֽה. The verb בָּצַע means "to cut off, gain by violence," and the participle בֹּצֵעַ thus means "one who gains by extortion," "the greedy one." The problem is בֵּרֵךְ—the piel perfect of ברך, which normally means "blessed, praised." How can the greedy one "bless" while simultaneously scorning (נִאֵץ) the LORD? Rashi resolves this by reading בֵּרֵךְ as sarcastic self-congratulation: the robber "blesses himself," saying שָׁלוֹם יִהְיֶה לִּי, "peace will be mine" (cf. Deut 29:18), even though his actions blaspheme God. Ibn Ezra takes a different approach, arguing that the grasping person "blesses" (congratulates) his fellow extortionists while despising the LORD's ways—violence creates a community of mutual admiration among the wicked.

The verb נִאֵץ (to scorn, blaspheme, revile) with יְהֹוָה as direct object is theologically explosive. It appears only 24 times in Scripture, often in contexts of existential threat to covenant relationship (Num 14:11, 23; 16:30; 2 Sam 12:14). The Torah Temimah cites this verse in the context of the Mishnaic prohibition against blessing over stolen goods (Bava Kamma 94a): Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov teaches that if someone steals a measure of wheat, grinds it, bakes it, and separates the priestly portion, he is not blessing but blaspheming—עַל זֶה נֶאֱמַר: בּוֹצֵעַ בֵּרֵךְ נִאֵץ ה׳, "concerning this it is said, 'the greedy one blesses, scorning the LORD.'" This rabbinic reading captures the verse's paradox: ritual performance (blessing) combined with injustice becomes its own profanation.

The verse thus reveals a theological psychology: the wicked's arrogance is not merely social but metaphysical. He boasts of achieving his desires, celebrates those who share his acquisitiveness, and in doing so implicitly denies divine justice. This is the first step toward the explicit atheism articulated in verse 4.

**Verse 4**

רָשָׁ֗ע כְּגֹ֣בַהּ אַ֭פּוֹ בַּל־יִדְרֹ֑שׁ; אֵ֥ין אֱ֝לֹהִ֗ים כׇּל־מְזִמּוֹתָֽיו׃

"The wicked, according to the height of his nose, does not seek [God]; 'there is no God' [is] all his schemes."

This verse is syntactically challenging, and its interpretation hinges on how one parses כְּגֹבַהּ אַפּוֹ. The phrase literally means "according to the height/loftiness of his nose," with אַף meaning both "nose" and (metonymically) "anger" or "countenance." Ibn Ezra correctly notes that facial height (particularly the nose) is the most visible marker of physical arrogance—when someone is haughty, they literally hold their nose high (גֹּבַהּ אַף). Compare the idiom in Psalm 10:4 with Proverbs 30:13: דּוֹר מָה־רָמוּ עֵינָיו וְעַפְעַפָּיו יִנָּשֵׂאוּ, "a generation—how lofty are its eyes, how raised its eyelids!" The physical posture of arrogance becomes a metonym for the spiritual posture.

The main clause בַּל־יִדְרֹשׁ introduces the key verb דָּרַשׁ (to seek, inquire of, call to account), which will function as a Leitwort throughout verses 4, 13, and 15. Here the wicked's theology is expressed negatively: בַּל־יִדְרֹשׁ, "he does not seek." The object of this seeking is ambiguous—does he not seek God? Or does he not believe God will seek (call to account) him? The ambiguity is likely deliberate, encompassing both the wicked's refusal to seek divine guidance and his confidence that God will not seek his wickedness.

The second colon is one of the most debated in the psalm: אֵין אֱלֹהִים כׇּל־מְזִמּוֹתָֽיו. The standard translation reads this as an interior quotation—the wicked "says in his heart" (implied from v. 6, 11, 13), "There is no God" (אֵין אֱלֹהִים). This reading takes כׇּל־מְזִמּוֹתָֽיו as "all his schemes" in the sense that "God does not exist" is the foundational premise of all his plotting. This interpretation finds strong support in Psalm 14:1 (=53:2): אָמַר נָבָל בְּלִבּוֹ אֵין אֱלֹהִים, "The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'"

However, Ibn Ezra proposes an alternative syntax: אֵין אֱלֹהִים is not a quotation but a statement meaning "God is not in all his schemes"—that is, God has no place in the wicked's calculations. This reading requires taking אֵין as a predicate ("is not") rather than as an existential negation ("does not exist"), and it aligns with Radak's interpretation: כִּי אֵין אֱלֹהִים שֹׁפְטִים בָּאָרֶץ, "for there is no God judging on earth" (i.e., God does not intervene in earthly affairs). This captures the psalm's nuance: the wicked is less a theoretical atheist than a practical one—he lives as if there is no God who will call him to account, even if he grants God's existence in principle.

The phrase בַּל־יִדְרֹשׁ will be ironically reversed in verse 15: תִּדְרוֹשׁ־רִשְׁעוֹ, "seek his wickedness." The wicked's confident assertion that God does not seek is precisely what will be refuted by the psalm's resolution. The Malbim, ever sensitive to lexical precision, suggests that the three-fold repetition of דרש represents a progression in the wicked's denial: first he claims God doesn't investigate (v. 4), then that God doesn't demand account (v. 13), but the psalmist affirms God will indeed seek the wicked's sin until it is found no more (v. 15).

**Verse 5**

יָ֘חִ֤ילוּ דְרָכָ֨ו ׀ בְּכׇל־עֵ֗ת; מָר֣וֹם מִ֭שְׁפָּטֶיךָ מִנֶּגְדּ֑וֹ; כׇּל־צ֝וֹרְרָ֗יו יָפִ֥יחַ בָּהֶֽם׃

"His ways prosper at all times; Your judgments are far removed from him; all his foes he snorts at."

This verse describes the wicked's apparent success through three compact cola that build a portrait of unchecked prosperity. The opening יָחִילוּ דְרָכָו is syntactically odd—the verb חול typically means "to writhe, be in pain" (as in childbirth), but here the context demands a meaning of success or stability. Rashi glosses it correctly: יַצְלִיחוּ, "they prosper," and compares Job 20:21: לֹא־יָחִיל טוּבוֹ, "his prosperity will not endure." This sense of the root חול meaning "to be firm, endure, prosper" (rather than "writhe") appears to be a secondary semantic development, and its use here may be a deliberate irony—the wicked's ways appear stable and enduring, in direct contrast to the trembling and writhing his victims experience.

The phrase בְּכׇל־עֵת ("at all times," "always") emphasizes the continuous nature of this prosperity—not occasional success but persistent, unbroken flourishing. This temporal marker creates a painful contrast with verse 1's לְעִתּוֹת בַּצָּרָה ("in times of trouble")—God hides during the times when help is needed, but the wicked prospers *at all times*.

The second colon introduces the spatial theology that pervades the psalm: מָרוֹם מִשְׁפָּטֶיךָ מִנֶּגְדּוֹ. The adjective מָרוֹם (high, exalted) is used as a predicate here: "Your judgments are high/far removed from before him." The preposition מִנֶּגְדּוֹ (literally "from opposite him") suggests that God's judgments are not merely absent but positively distant—they stand far off where he cannot see them. Ibn Ezra takes מָרוֹם as a vocative (an epithet for God: "O Exalted One"), yielding "O Exalted One, Your judgments are removed from him," but the simpler reading takes מָרוֹם as an adjective describing the inaccessibility of divine justice.

This spatial metaphor recalls verse 1's complaint that God stands בְּרָחוֹק (at a distance). Here the distance is not merely God's position but the position of His מִשְׁפָּטִים (judgments, justice). The wicked experiences God's justice as something that exists on a different plane—high, remote, irrelevant to his affairs. Radak suggests this reflects the wicked's perception: he sees God's judgments as so exalted and remote that they will never descend to touch him.

The final colon depicts the wicked's contemptuous attitude toward his adversaries: כׇּל־צוֹרְרָיו יָפִיחַ בָּהֶם. The verb פוח means to puff, blow, snort, and appears in several contexts of contemptuous dismissal (Ps 12:6; Mal 1:13; Job 31:27). The image is visceral—the wicked literally snorts at his enemies like an animal expressing disdain. Rashi explains בְּהַפָּחַת רוּחַ הוּא מֵפִיחַ בָּהֶם, "with a breath of spirit he blows at them," suggesting effortless dismissal. They collapse at his slightest exhalation. The phrase כׇּל־צוֹרְרָיו creates a comprehensive scope—not some enemies but *all* his foes fall before him.

The verse thus presents a troubling portrait of successful evil: the wicked's ways are stable, God's judgments are remote, and all opposition is easily dismissed. The prosperity of the wicked is not explained or qualified here—it is simply observed as an empirical reality that makes the psalm's opening question (לָמָה) all the more acute. If this is how the world actually works, why does God stand aloof?

**Verse 6**

אָמַ֣ר בְּ֭לִבּוֹ בַּל־אֶמּ֑וֹט; לְדֹ֥ר וָ֝דֹ֗ר אֲשֶׁ֣ר לֹא־בְרָֽע׃

"He says in his heart, 'I shall not be shaken, through all generations I who am not in trouble.'"

This verse introduces the first of three interior monologues using the formula אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ (literally "he said in his heart," vv. 6, 11, 13), a wisdom technique that exposes the wicked's thought-world. The phrase appears throughout Psalms and wisdom literature to reveal inner attitudes that may contradict outward appearances (cf. Ps 14:1, Eccl 2:15). The heart (לֵב) in biblical anthropology is not the seat of emotions but of thought, will, and decision—the mind's inner sanctum where one's true theology resides. What the wicked "says in his heart" is therefore his operating theology, not necessarily what he professes publicly.

The content of his thought is בַּל־אֶמּוֹט: "I shall not be shaken/moved." The verb מוט appears frequently in Psalms in both negative and positive contexts—not being shaken is a sign of divine protection (Ps 16:8, 62:3, 7) or divine establishment (Ps 93:1, 96:10). But in the mouth of the wicked, this confidence is false security, a presumption rather than a trust. The formula בַּל־אֶמּוֹט becomes almost a parody of the righteous person's confidence. Compare Psalm 16:8: שִׁוִּיתִי יְהוָה לְנֶגְדִּי תָמִיד כִּי מִימִינִי בַּל־אֶמּוֹט, "I have set the LORD before me always; He is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken." The righteous person's stability comes from setting God before him; the wicked's stability comes from denying God's active involvement (v. 4).

The temporal expansion לְדֹר וָדֹר ("from generation to generation," "through all generations") makes the wicked's false security even more grandiose. He does not merely claim stability for his lifetime but extends his confidence across generations—an echo of God's own eternal stability (Ps 89:2, 102:13, 106:31). The relative clause אֲשֶׁר לֹא־בְרָע (literally "who/which [am] not in trouble") is syntactically ambiguous. It could mean "for all generations that are not in trouble" (i.e., I will never see trouble), or more likely, "I who am not in trouble [and never will be]." Radak understands it as the wicked's temporal projection: לְדֹר וָדֹר אֲשֶׁר לֹא־בְרָע, "from generation to generation, which [times] I will not see trouble."

The Malbim makes a penetrating observation about this verse in the larger progression of the wicked's monologues. In verse 6, the wicked boasts about his own stability (בַּל־אֶמּוֹט). In verse 11, he extends this to a theological claim about God's forgetfulness (שָׁכַח אֵל). In verse 13, he makes the explicit denial (לֹא תִדְרֹשׁ). This progression from self-confidence through divine absence to explicit denial represents the wicked's intellectual journey from practical atheism to theoretical atheism—from living as if God doesn't matter to asserting that God doesn't act.

The phrase's placement in Jewish liturgy is intriguing. While this specific verse does not appear in the standard liturgy, the contrasting use of בַּל־אֶמּוֹט in Psalms 16 and 21 (both psalms of trust) does appear, creating a liturgical counterpoint to Psalm 10's wicked who makes the same claim but without basis in divine relationship. The daily recitation of Psalm 30:7, which ironically quotes the righteous person's false confidence (וַאֲנִי אָמַרְתִּי בְשַׁלְוִי בַּל־אֶמּוֹט לְעוֹלָם, "I said in my prosperity, 'I shall never be shaken'"), serves as a liturgical warning against precisely the attitude articulated here by the wicked.

**Verse 7**

אָלָ֤ה ׀ פִּ֣יהוּ מָ֭לֵא וּמִרְמ֣וֹת וָתֹ֑ךְ; תַּ֥חַת לְ֝שׁוֹנ֗וֹ עָמָ֥ל וָאָֽוֶן׃

"His mouth is full of oaths, deceits, and oppression; under his tongue are mischief and iniquity."

This verse shifts from the wicked's interior world (his heart, v. 6) to his exterior—specifically, his speech organs. The anatomical focus on mouth (פֶּה) and tongue (לָשׁוֹן) creates a somatic map of evil. The opening phrase אָלָה פִּיהוּ מָלֵא is particularly emphatic. The noun אָלָה can mean "oath" (particularly a covenantal oath invoking curses for violation) or simply "curse." Here, in conjunction with מִרְמוֹת (deceits) and תֹךְ (oppression/fraud), it likely refers to false oaths—the wicked swears by God's name while plotting harm, making his very speech an inversion of covenant language.

The verb מָלֵא (full, filled) appears in the absolute state, functioning predicatively: "his mouth [is] full." Radak notes that מָלֵא functions as a verb here (מְמַלֵּא, "fills"), yielding "he fills his mouth with…" But the syntax as it stands emphasizes the state of fullness rather than the act of filling—his mouth is a container brimming with malice. The three direct objects create a tricolon of speech-based violence: אָלָה (oaths/curses), מִרְמוֹת (deceits), and תֹךְ (oppression). The latter term is rare (appearing elsewhere in Prov 29:13 and possibly Ps 72:14), but cognate to the Aramaic and Syriac roots meaning "to oppress, harm."

The second colon introduces one of Scripture's most vivid anatomical metaphors: תַּחַת לְשׁוֹנוֹ עָמָל וָאָוֶן, "under his tongue [are] mischief and iniquity." The preposition תַּחַת creates a spatial image—the tongue as a landscape with an underside, a hidden space where malice lurks. This image of concealed venom under the tongue recurs in Job 20:12: אִם־יַמְתִּיק בְּפִיו רָעָה יַכְחִידֶנָּה תַּחַת לְשׁוֹנוֹ, "Though evil is sweet in his mouth and he hides it under his tongue." The tongue becomes a weapon that stores its poison until the moment of deployment. Radak glosses: כְּשֶׁיִּשְׁבַּע בַּלְּשׁוֹן, תַּחַת הַלְּשׁוֹן בַּלֵּב יֵשׁ עָמָל וָאָוֶן, "When he swears with the tongue, under the tongue in the heart there is mischief and iniquity"—that is, his outward oath contradicts his inner malice.

The nouns עָמָל and אָוֶן function as a word-pair throughout Scripture, particularly in contexts of violence and injustice. עָמָל denotes "toil, trouble, mischief" (with connotations of wearisome labor turned to harmful purpose), while אָוֶן signifies "iniquity, wickedness, emptiness" (often with cultic overtones—idols are "אָוֶן," worthless things). Together they encompass both the effort and the moral emptiness of the wicked's scheming. The Malbim, characteristically precise in his lexical distinctions, argues that עָמָל refers to evil intentions/plans, while אָוֶן refers to the empty, vain nature of those plans—they are ultimately futile because they oppose divine justice.

This verse presents a striking contrast between public and hidden speech. The mouth is "full" (visible, overflowing), but what it's full of is performative falsehood (oaths, deceits). Meanwhile, under the tongue—hidden, concealed—is the true content: עָמָל וָאָוֶן. The wicked's speech is an inversion of the righteous person's speech described in Psalm 37:30: פִּי־צַדִּיק יֶהְגֶּה חָכְמָה וּלְשׁוֹנוֹ תְּדַבֵּר מִשְׁפָּט, "The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks justice." Here, the wicked's mouth utters oaths (possibly false piety) while his tongue conceals injustice.

The verse functions in the psalm's larger structure as the transition from the wicked's interior life (heart) to his exterior actions (predation). Speech is the bridge—it reveals the hidden (what's under the tongue) even while concealing it (through oaths and deceits). This makes verse 7 the hinge between the wicked's theology (vv. 4-6) and his violence (vv. 8-10).

**Verse 8**

יֵשֵׁ֤ב ׀ בְּמַאְרַ֬ב חֲצֵרִ֗ים; בַּֽ֭מִּסְתָּרִים יַהֲרֹ֣ג נָקִ֑י; עֵ֝ינָ֗יו לְֽחֵלְכָ֥ה יִצְפֹּֽנוּ׃

"He sits in ambush of villages; in secret places he kills the innocent; his eyes spy on the helpless."

This verse inaugurates the psalm's central extended metaphor: the wicked as predator. The opening verb יֵשֵׁב (sits) creates a deliberate spatial counterpoint to verse 1's תַּעֲמֹד (stands). Where God "stands" at a distance, the wicked "sits" in ambush—a posture of patient, calculated waiting. The phrase בְּמַאְרַב חֲצֵרִים is syntactically dense: מַאְרַב (from ארב, "to lie in wait, ambush") denotes the ambush site itself, while חֲצֵרִים (literally "courts" or "settlements") refers to villages or unwalled towns. Rashi identifies these as the outer courtyards or village squares where people gather, making them ideal hunting grounds for a predator who blends into public spaces.

The second colon intensifies the image: בַּמִּסְתָּרִים יַהֲרֹג נָקִי. The plural מִסְתָּרִים (from סתר, "to hide") refers to hiding places, secret spots—creating a paradox with the public spaces of the first colon. The wicked operates both openly (in village squares) and secretly (in hidden places), suggesting his predation saturates all spaces. The verb יַהֲרֹג (he kills) moves beyond exploitation to murder, and its object נָקִי (innocent, clean, blameless) creates a moral absolute—this is not the elimination of a rival but the slaughter of the guiltless. The adjective נָקִי appears only here in Psalm 10, but its resonance with נְקִי דָּם (innocent blood, Deut 19:13) suggests the legal category of murder that cries out for justice.

The final colon introduces the hunter's method: עֵינָיו לְחֵלְכָה יִצְפֹּנוּ, "his eyes spy on the helpless." The verb צָפַן (to hide, treasure up, spy) is particularly apt—it suggests both concealment (hiding one's intentions) and vigilance (watching, spying). The object חֵלְכָה (or חֵלֶךְ) is a rare term, appearing elsewhere as חֶלְכָּה in verses 10 and 14. Its etymology is debated, but it clearly denotes the vulnerable, perhaps from חלה (to be weak, sick) or related to Aramaic חִילָא (strength), meaning "the one without strength." The Masoretic tradition preserves it as חֵלְכָה with a second-person suffix (לְחֵלְכָה, "your helpless one"), which Rashi interprets as addressed to Israel: "To you, Your helpless ones." This vocative reading makes sense of the awkward possessive suffix and creates a direct address to God's vulnerable people.

The image of the watching eyes is particularly chilling. Predators rely on vision to select and track prey. The wicked's eyes are not passive but active, searching (יִצְפֹּנוּ) for targets. This visual predation contrasts sharply with verse 1's divine hiddenness—God has hidden His eyes (תַּעְלִים), while the wicked's eyes are constantly surveilling. The verb צָפַן in the hiphil (to lay up, hide) may also suggest the eyes "storing up" their victims—cataloging the helpless for future violence.

The progression across this verse traces the predator's method: first, he positions himself (יֵשֵׁב) in populated areas; second, he operates from concealment (בַּמִּסְתָּרִים); third, he targets the defenseless (נָקִי, חֵלְכָה). This is not opportunistic violence but systematic hunting. The Malbim notes that the wicked resembles a lion in his calculated approach—he doesn't simply attack but sits, waits, and watches before striking. This will be made explicit in verse 9's simile.

**Verse 9**

יֶאֱרֹ֬ב בַּמִּסְתָּ֨ר ׀ כְּאַרְיֵ֬ה בְסֻכֹּ֗ה; יֶ֭אֱרֹב לַחֲט֣וֹף עָנִ֑י; יַחְטֹ֥ף עָ֝נִ֗י בְּמׇשְׁכ֥וֹ בְרִשְׁתּֽוֹ׃

"He lurks in secret like a lion in his lair; he lurks to snatch the lowly; he snatches the lowly by dragging him in his net."

This verse makes explicit what verse 8 implied: the wicked is a lion. The simile כְּאַרְיֵה בְסֻכֹּה ("like a lion in his lair") draws on Ancient Near Eastern iconography of the lion as apex predator. The noun סֻכָּה typically means "booth, shelter" (as in the festival of Sukkot), but here refers to the lion's thicket or lair—a place of concealment from which to launch attacks. Compare Job 38:40: בְּסֻכָּה יֵשֵׁבוּ ("they crouch in their dens"). The lion in its lair is a standard image of patient, concealed power ready to pounce.

The tricolon structure creates relentless rhythm: יֶאֱרֹב...יֶאֱרֹב...יַחְטֹף. The verb ארב (to lie in wait, ambush) repeats twice, hammering the motif of calculated waiting, before the climactic יַחְטֹף (he seizes, snatches). This verb חטף appears three times in two verses (vv. 9-10), creating an aural assault that mimics the violence being described. The object of this predation is עָנִי (the lowly, poor, afflicted)—the same term from verse 2, but now appearing twice in this verse, emphasizing the targeting of the vulnerable.

The final phrase בְּמׇשְׁכוֹ בְרִשְׁתּוֹ is syntactically complex. The infinitive construct מׇשְׁכוֹ (from משׁך, "to draw, drag") with בְּ means "by his dragging" or "when he drags," and it governs the second בְּ phrase: בְרִשְׁתּוֹ, "with his net." The image suddenly shifts from a lion to a fisherman or hunter using nets—a mixed metaphor that some commentators find awkward but which actually compounds the sense of threat through metaphorical layering. The wicked is both lion (raw predatory power) and net-hunter (calculated trapping). Radak notes that nets were used to trap both animals and humans in ancient warfare, so the metaphor encompasses multiple forms of capture.

The noun רֶשֶׁת (net) appears 22 times in Scripture, often in contexts of entrapment by enemies (Ps 9:16, 25:15, 31:5, 35:7-8). The figurative language database shows that nets function as traps set by the wicked for the righteous across the Psalter. Here the net makes explicit what has been implicit—the wicked's schemes (מְזִמּוֹת, v. 2) are traps, and the lowly are ensnared through a combination of predatory ambush (lion) and methodical capture (net). The dragging motion (מָשַׁךְ) suggests the victim is already caught and being pulled away, unable to escape.

The Malbim's comment on this verse is characteristic of his method. He notes that the psalm begins by likening the wicked to a young lion (כְּפִיר, implied from Job's usage) who goes out hunting openly, but as the wicked "matures," he becomes like the adult lion (אַרְיֵה) who lies in ambush, operating through cunning rather than overt force. This developmental reading may be over-reading the text, but it captures something important: the wicked's violence evolves from hot pursuit (יִדְלַק, v. 2) to cold calculation (יֶאֱרֹב, vv. 8-9).

The verse creates a disturbing portrait: the wicked is simultaneously everywhere (public squares, v. 8) and nowhere (hidden in ambush, v. 9). He operates through both raw power (lion) and technology (nets). And his target is singular and repeated: עָנִי—the one who is already low, already vulnerable, already afflicted. This is not even predation among equals but the strong preying systematically on the weak.

**Verse 10**

יִדְכֶּה יָשֹׁחַ; וְנָפַ֥ל בַּעֲצוּמָ֗יו חֵ֫לֶ֥כאים׃

"He crouches, he bows down; and the helpless fall by his mighty [claws]."

This verse is both phonetically and textu textually problematic, with significant Ketiv/Qere variations that affect interpretation. The Masoretic Ketiv reads וְדָכָה יָשֹׁחַ ("and the crushed one bows down"), while the Qere reads יִדְכֶּה יָשֹׁחַ ("he crouches, he bows down"). The Qere makes better sense in context: the wicked is the subject, continuing the lion imagery from verse 9. The two verbs דכה (to be crushed/to crouch) and שחח (to bow down, be bowed down) both describe a low, crouched posture—the predator lowering his profile before the strike.

The phonetics here deserve attention. According to the transcription, the verse would be pronounced approximately: `yidh-**KEH** yā-**SHŌ**-aḥ wə-nā-**FAL** ba-ʿa-tsū-**MĀY**-w **ḤĒL** kā-**'IY**-m`. The stressed syllables (KEH, SHŌḤ, FAL, MĀY) create a falling rhythm that perhaps mimics the collapsing victims. The sibilant sounds in יָשֹׁחַ (SHŌ) combined with the harsh guttural of נָפַל (FAL) create an aural effect of stealth followed by violence.

The second colon וְנָפַל בַּעֲצוּמָיו is where textual and interpretive difficulties intensify. The verb נָפַל (to fall) is clear, but what falls? And what is בַּעֲצוּמָיו? The Ketiv reads חֵלְכָּאִים (a plural form related to חֵלְכָה, "helpless ones" from v. 8), while the Qere reads חֵל כָּאִים, separating this into two words: חֵל ("company, host") and כָּאִים (participle from כאה, "to be crushed, weak"). If we follow the Qere, the phrase means "the company/host of the crushed ones" or "the afflicted ones." But this still leaves בַּעֲצוּמָיו ambiguous.

The noun עָצוּם (strong, mighty) appears as a plural construct with third masculine singular suffix: בַּעֲצוּמָיו, "by/with his mighty [ones]." This could refer to: (1) his mighty claws or limbs (continuing the lion metaphor); (2) his mighty troops or helpers (suggesting the wicked has accomplices); or (3) his mighty traps/nets (linking to רֶשֶׁת in v. 9). Rashi takes option (2): "To his strong ones the helpless fall"—that is, the victims fall into the hands of the wicked's powerful gang. Radak prefers (3): "He falls by his mighty [traps]"—the victim is brought down by the predator's powerful implements. Ibn Ezra reads it as (1): בַּעֲצוּמָיו = his strong limbs, the tools of his violence.

The ambiguity is perhaps intentional, creating a semantic cloud around the violence—the means of attack remains deliberately vague, emphasizing the victim's helplessness rather than the specific weapon. What's clear is the motion: a downward fall (נָפַל). The victim collapses under the weight of the wicked's "mighty" something. This vertical movement (falling) contrasts with the horizontal dragging (מָשַׁךְ) of verse 9, together creating a complete picture of capture: first the dragging into the net, then the falling/crushing.

The Torah Temimah does not cite this verse, likely due to its textual difficulties and its position within a larger metaphorical unit. But the image of falling by the "mighty [claws]" of the predator resonates with other biblical descriptions of violent oppression, particularly in Amos's social critique (Amos 2:7, 4:1) where the powerful "crush" (רָצַץ) or "trample" (שְׁאַף) the poor. The vocabulary of crushing and collapsing becomes the prophetic language for systemic violence against the vulnerable.

The verse completes the hunt cycle begun in verse 8: ambush (v. 8) → lurking (v. 9a) → snatching (v. 9b) → crushing/collapsing (v. 10). The predator has achieved his goal. The helpless lie fallen. And this brings us to the second interior monologue (v. 11), where the wicked interprets his success theologically.

**Verse 11**

אָמַ֣ר בְּ֭לִבּוֹ שָׁ֣כַֽח אֵ֑ל; הִסְתִּ֥יר פָּ֝נָ֗יו בַּל־רָאָ֥ה לָנֶֽצַח׃

"He says in his heart, 'God has forgotten; He has hidden His face; He will never see.'"

This verse returns to the interior monologue formula (אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ) for the second time, now after the wicked's successful predation. His theological conclusion from his unchecked violence is stated in three parallel clauses, creating a crescendo of divine absence. The first clause, שָׁכַח אֵל ("God has forgotten"), uses the perfect tense to assert an accomplished fact—not "God might forget" or "God seems to forget," but "God *has* forgotten." The verb שכח with God as subject is theologically provocative, appearing primarily in contexts where Israel fears God has forgotten them (Ps 13:2, 42:10, 44:25). But here it's the wicked who claims this, and his claim is not a lament but a celebration—divine forgetfulness means freedom to oppress.

The second clause intensifies: הִסְתִּיר פָּנָיו, "He has hidden His face." This phrase echoes the psalmist's own complaint in verse 1 (תַּעְלִים), creating the psalm's central irony—both the righteous sufferer and the wicked perpetrator agree that God has hidden His face. But where the psalmist protests this hiddenness as unjust, the wicked exploits it as permission. The idiom of "hiding the face" (הסתיר פנים) functions throughout Scripture as the standard expression for divine withdrawal, particularly as covenant curse (Deut 31:17-18; cf. Ps 27:9, 30:8, 69:18, 88:15, 102:3, 143:7). The face (פָּנִים) metonymically represents presence, favor, attention—to hide the face is to withhold relationship.

The third clause provides the temporal scope: בַּל־רָאָ֥ה לָנֶֽצַח, "He will never see" (or "He has not seen forever"). The adverb לָנֶֽצַח can mean "forever, permanently" or "up until now, for a long time." The wicked's theology posits divine seeing as something that doesn't happen across the entire temporal spectrum—God hasn't seen in the past (שָׁכַח), isn't seeing in the present (הִסְתִּיר), and won't see in the future (בַּל־רָאָ֥ה לָנֶֽצַח). This forms a complete theodicy—or rather, an anti-theodicy, a theological justification for why evil succeeds.

The verb ראה (to see) becomes the psalm's key theological term. The wicked claims God doesn't see (v. 11), but the psalmist will assert God *does* see (רָאִתָה, v. 14). The contrast between these perfect tense verbs—לא רָאָה (He has not seen) versus רָאִתָה (You have seen)—structures the psalm's theological argument. Vision equals attention equals justice. If God sees, He must act. The wicked's entire system depends on God's not-seeing; the psalmist's petition depends on God's seeing.

Ibn Ezra makes the interesting observation that this monologue presents divine absence not as a logical inference but as an empirical conclusion: the wicked observes that he has acted with impunity, therefore he concludes God has forgotten. This is practical atheism—theology derived from experience rather than revelation. The Malbim adds that the three clauses represent three different forms of divine knowledge: שָׁכַח (God doesn't remember), הִסְתִּיר (God doesn't see), רָאָה לָנֶֽצַח (God doesn't comprehend fully). The progression moves from memory to sight to eternal comprehension, each clause denying a different aspect of omniscience.

This verse occurs in a particularly striking liturgical context. In the Sefardic Selichot for the 20th of Sivan, verse 1 (לָמָה יהוה תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָחוֹק) is quoted as part of a catena of lament verses questioning divine hiddenness. The liturgy creates a powerful juxtaposition by placing the psalmist's question alongside verses from Psalms 44 and 74, building a tapestry of communal anguish about God's apparent absence. What's theologically significant is that the liturgy takes the wicked's perception (v. 11: God has hidden His face) and transforms it into the community's prayer—the righteous cry out *about* God's hiddenness even as the wicked exploit it. This liturgical usage demonstrates how Jewish tradition read Psalm 10 not as describing an individual wicked person but as addressing the problem of collective suffering under oppression.

The verse stands at the structural center of the psalm's first half (vv. 1-11), bringing the description of wickedness to its theological climax. Everything that follows (vv. 12-18) will work to refute this claim of divine blindness.

**Verse 12**

קוּמָ֤ה יְהֹוָ֗ה אֵ֭ל נְשָׂ֣א יָדֶ֑ךָ; אַל־תִּשְׁכַּ֥ח עֲנָוִֽים׃

"Arise, O LORD! O God, lift up Your hand; do not forget the lowly."

This verse marks the psalm's dramatic pivot from description to petition. The imperative קוּמָה (arise!) is a standard plea for divine intervention, appearing throughout Psalms at moments of crisis (Ps 3:8, 7:7, 9:20, 17:13, 35:2, 44:27, 74:22, 82:8). The verb קום (to arise, stand up) is theologically loaded—it signals the transition from sitting in judgment to standing to act, from passivity to intervention. The call "Arise!" implicitly acknowledges that God has been sitting, resting, or inactive—precisely the complaint of verse 1 (תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָח֑וֹק, "You stand aloof").

The address יְהֹוָה אֵל is striking—the personal covenant name YHWH paired with the generic divine title El. This double divine naming is relatively rare (cf. Ps 85:9, Isa 7:11) and creates an effect of solemn invocation. The shift from the generic "God" (אֱלֹהִים) used in the wicked's monologue (v. 4) to the covenant name YHWH here reasserts the personal, relational character of Israel's God—not an abstract deity who might forget, but the God of Sinai who has bound Himself to His people.

The second imperative נְשָׂא יָדֶךָ (lift up Your hand) employs the idiom of raised hand as gesture of oath-taking or power-display. Throughout Scripture, the raised hand signifies readiness to act (Exod 14:16, Isa 49:22), often specifically to strike in judgment (Isa 11:15, Zech 2:13). Rashi glosses it as showing power: להראות כֹּחֲךָ, "show Your strength." The hand (יָד) represents agency and power—to lift the hand is to prepare to act. This petition directly counters the wicked's success described in verse 5, where God's judgments were "far removed" (מָרוֹם מִשְׁפָּטֶיךָ). If God's justice is far off, let His hand be raised near.

The final clause אַל־תִּשְׁכַּ֥ח עֲנָוִֽים creates explicit verbal linkage to verse 11: the wicked said שָׁכַח אֵל ("God has forgotten"), but the psalmist pleads אַל־תִּשְׁכַּח ("do not forget"). The same verb in contrasting forms—the wicked's confident assertion becomes the psalmist's anxious prohibition. This is the psalm's hinge: will God's remembering prove the wicked wrong?

The object of this remembering is עֲנָוִֽים (the lowly, humble, afflicted). Here there's a textual variant: the Ketiv reads עניים (aniyim, the poor), while the Qere reads עֲנָוִֽים (anavim, the lowly/humble). The distinction is subtle but significant. עָנִי emphasizes socioeconomic poverty and affliction, while עָנָו emphasizes humility and lowliness as moral/spiritual posture. Radak notes both readings and suggests they're essentially synonymous in this context—the poor *are* the humble because oppression has brought them low. The Qere's preference for עֲנָוִֽים may reflect a theological reading that sees the victims not just as economically poor but as the spiritually humble who trust in God despite suffering.

This verse appears prominently in High Holiday liturgy. In both Ashkenazi and Edot HaMizrach traditions, during the chazan's repetition of the Amidah on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, after declaring himself unworthy, the prayer leader invokes this verse: לְחַלּוֹתְךָ שְׁלָחֽוּנִי מַקְהֲלוֹת הֲמוֹנֶֽךָ. תָּכִין לִבָּם תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶֽךָ, "Your teeming congregations have sent me to entreat You. Prepare their heart; incline Your ear" (citing v. 17). While verse 12 itself isn't quoted, verse 17's liturgical use demonstrates how Jewish tradition read these petitions as paradigmatic prayer language for moments when the community feels forgotten. The call to "not forget" (אַל־תִּשְׁכַּח) resonates with the High Holiday theme of divine remembrance (זִכְרוֹנוֹת)—the fear that God might forget Israel in judgment, and the plea for Him to remember His covenant.

The tricolon structure of imperatives (קוּמָה...נְשָׂא...אַל־תִּשְׁכַּח) creates rhetorical urgency through accumulation. Each imperative addresses a different aspect of the problem: קוּמָה counters God's standing aloof (v. 1), נְשָׂא counters God's judgments being far removed (v. 5), and אַל־תִּשְׁכַּח counters the wicked's claim that God has forgotten (v. 11). The verse thus functions as point-by-point rebuttal of the psalm's opening theological crisis.

**Verse 13**

עַל־מֶ֤ה ׀ נִאֵ֖ץ רָשָׁ֥ע ׀ אֱלֹהִ֑ים; אָמַ֥ר בְּ֝לִבּ֗וֹ לֹ֣א תִדְרֹֽשׁ׃

"Why should the wicked man scorn God, thinking You do not call to account?"

This verse introduces the psalm's second rhetorical question (עַל־מֶה, "on what basis?" or "why?"), now not addressed to God (as in v. 1) but posed about the wicked. The interrogative עַל־מֶה appears less frequently than לָמָה but carries similar force—it demands explanation or justification (cf. Jer 8:14, 9:11). Ibn Ezra glosses it as לְשׁוֹן תִּמָּהָא, "language of wonder/amazement," capturing the psalmist's incredulity: *Why* would anyone dare to scorn God?

The verb נִאֵץ (to scorn, despise, blaspheme) reappears from verse 3, where it described the wicked blessing (congratulating) himself while scorning (נִאֵץ) the LORD. Here the scorning is made explicit with אֱלֹהִים as direct object. This verb appears 24 times in Scripture, often at covenant crisis moments (Num 14:11, 23; 16:30; 2 Sam 12:14). To "scorn" God is to treat Him with contempt, to act as if His commands and judgments are negligible. Psalm 74:10, 18 uses the identical verb in similar theodicy contexts: עַד־מָתַי אֱלֹהִים יְחָרֶף צָר יְנָאֵץ אוֹיֵב שִׁמְךָ לָנֶצַח, "How long, O God, shall the foe blaspheme, shall the enemy forever revile Your name?"

The answer to "why?" comes immediately: the third and final interior monologue using אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ. What the wicked "says in his heart" this time is לֹא תִדְרֹֽשׁ, "You do not call to account." The verb דרש, which appeared in verse 4 (בַּל־יִדְרֹשׁ), now recurs with God as subject. This creates a crucial wordplay across three verses: 
- v. 4: בַּל־יִדְרֹשׁ (he does not seek)
- v. 13: לֹא תִדְרֹֽשׁ (You do not call to account)  
- v. 15: תִּדְרוֹשׁ־רִשְׁעוֹ (You will seek his wickedness)

The verb דרש has a semantic range spanning "seek, inquire, investigate, demand account, avenge." The wicked's claim is comprehensive: God doesn't seek out evil, doesn't investigate it, and doesn't demand account for it. This is the logical completion of the practical atheism articulated in verses 4 and 11. If God has forgotten (v. 11), then obviously He won't call to account (v. 13).

The Malbim provides a characteristic lexical analysis, arguing that the three heart-monologues represent a progression in the wicked's denial of divine providence: (1) v. 6—he denies that God will punish him personally (בַּל־אֶמּוֹט); (2) v. 11—he denies that God sees at all (הִסְתִּיר פָּנָיו); (3) v. 13—he denies that God holds anyone accountable (לֹא תִדְרֹֽשׁ). This movement from personal exemption through universal divine blindness to comprehensive divine inaction represents the wicked's intellectual trajectory toward full practical atheism.

Radak notes that this verse (עַל־מֶה נִאֵץ) should be read as the psalmist's question to God: "Why do You allow the wicked to scorn You?" The question isn't merely rhetorical but accusatory—why does God permit this scorn to go unpunished? This reading makes the verse function as another complaint, linking it to the opening lament. The wicked scorns God because he believes (אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ) that God won't do anything about it. And the psalmist's question to God is: Why prove him right? Why allow the scorn to continue?

The verse doesn't cite Torah legislation, but its language resonates with the theological principle throughout Deuteronomy that God "seeks" (דרש) Israel's obedience and "calls to account" (דרש) their rebellion. In Deuteronomy 23:22, the verb appears in a financial context: כִּי־דָרֹשׁ יִדְרְשֶׁנּוּ יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ מֵעִמָּךְ, "The LORD your God will surely require it of you" (regarding vows). The wicked's denial that God "seeks/requires" is thus a denial of basic covenant theology—the belief that God tracks human behavior and demands account.

The verse completes the psalm's first movement (vv. 1-13). We've moved from the opening lament about divine distance (v. 1), through an extended portrait of the wicked's actions and thoughts (vv. 2-11), to direct petition (v. 12) and this climactic question (v. 13). Everything that follows will work to answer this question by demonstrating that God *does* see, *does* remember, and *will* call to account.

**Verse 14**

רָאִ֡תָה כִּי־אַתָּ֤ה ׀ עָ֘מָ֤ל וָכַ֨עַס ׀ תַּבִּיט֮ לָתֵ֢ת בְּיָ֫דֶ֥ךָ; עָ֭לֶיךָ יַעֲזֹ֣ב חֵלֵ֑כָה; יָ֝ת֗וֹם אַתָּ֤ה ׀ הָיִ֬יתָ עוֹזֵֽר׃

"You DO see, for You behold mischief and vexation, to take [it] in hand; upon You the helpless leaves [his burden]; You have been the orphan's helper."

This verse is the psalm's theological hinge, marked by the emphatic fronted perfect verb רָאִתָה ("You have seen" or "You DO see"). The fronting of this verb creates maximum rhetorical force—it places "seeing" at the absolute beginning of the colon, contradicting everything the wicked claimed in verse 11 (בַּל־רָאָ֥ה לָנֶֽצַח, "He will never see"). The shift from the wicked's imperfect/jussive verbs (future or modal) to the psalmist's perfect tense (completed action) is crucial: this is not a hope that God *will* see but an assertion that God *has* seen, *does* see. The perfect tense functions as what grammarians call a "perfective of conviction"—grammatically past but asserting present reality with the force of accomplished fact.

The explanatory כִּי ("for, because") introduces the evidence: אַתָּה עָמָל וָכַעַס תַּבִּיט. The pronoun אַתָּה (You) is technically redundant (the verb רָאִתָה already indicates second person), but its presence creates emphasis: "*You*—You specifically—behold..." The objects of this beholding are עָמָל וָכַעַס (mischief and vexation). These nouns appeared earlier: עָמָל in verse 7 (תַּחַת לְשׁוֹנוֹ עָמָל וָאָוֶן, "under his tongue are mischief and iniquity") as the wicked's hidden malice. Now the psalmist asserts that what the wicked hides under his tongue, God observes openly. The verb תַּבִּיט (from נבט, "to look, regard, behold") intensifies רָאָה—not just seeing but looking *into*, examining, regarding closely.

The purpose clause לָתֵת בְּיָדֶךָ is idiomatically rich. The phrase נָתַן בְּיָד typically means "to give into [someone's] hand," signifying to hand over, to place in one's power, or to take charge of. But whose hand? The suffix is ambiguous—it could be "Your hand" (God takes the mischief in hand to deal with it) or "his hand" (God gives the mischief into the wicked's hand temporarily). Context favors the former: God sees the violence in order to take it into His own hand—that is, to take responsibility for addressing it, to take control of the situation. Rashi glosses: לָתֵת לוֹ גְּמוּלוֹ, "to give him his recompense."

The second colon עָלֶיךָ יַעֲזֹב חֵלֵכָה introduces a new subject: the helpless one (חֵלֵכָה). The verb עזב here doesn't mean "abandon" (its usual sense) but "leave" in the sense of "entrust" or "commit"—the helpless leaves his burden עָלֶיךָ, "upon You." This idiom appears in Psalm 37:5: גּוֹל עַל־יְהוָה דַּרְכֶּךָ, "Commit your way to the LORD." The image is of laying down a burden at someone's feet, entrusting the problem to them. The helpless has no other recourse, no human defender, so he leaves his case with God. Rashi reads this eschatologically: יִשְׂרָאֵל עַמְּךָ שֶׁהֵם חֵילְךָ הֵם עוֹזְבִים עָלֶיךָ אֶת הַמַּשָּׂא, "Your people Israel, who are Your army, they leave upon You the burden [to execute justice on the wicked]."

The final colon introduces the orphan (יָתוֹם) for the first time, though he will reappear in verse 18. The orphan throughout Scripture represents the paradigmatic defenseless person—fatherless, without inherited land rights, without a legal advocate. Torah repeatedly commands protection of the orphan (Exod 22:21-23; Deut 10:18, 14:29, 24:17-21, 27:19). The phrase אַתָּה הָיִיתָ עוֹזֵֽר uses the perfect tense again: "You *have been* helper"—not "You will help" but "You have a track record of helping." This appeals to God's past faithfulness as ground for present intervention. The participle עוֹזֵֽר (helper) appears frequently in Psalms as a divine title (Ps 30:11, 54:6, 118:7), often in contexts where human help has failed.

The verse thus accomplishes a triple rhetorical move: (1) it contradicts the wicked's theology of divine blindness (רָאִתָה versus בַּל־רָאָה); (2) it reframes the helpless's situation from abandonment to trusting entrustment (יַעֲזֹב חֵלֵכָה); and (3) it grounds present petition in past faithfulness (אַתָּה הָיִיתָ עוֹזֵֽר). The shift from complaint to confidence is not based on changed circumstances—the wicked is still oppressing, God's judgments still seem remote—but on a shift in *perception*, in theological assertion. The psalmist chooses to assert God's seeing against all empirical evidence to the contrary. This is the psalm's existential wager.

**Verse 15**

שְׁ֭בֹר זְר֣וֹעַ רָשָׁ֑ע; וָ֝רָ֗ע תִּֽדְרוֹשׁ־רִשְׁע֥וֹ בַל־תִּמְצָֽא׃

"Break the arm of the wicked man; and as for the evil one, seek his wickedness until You find it no more."

This verse returns to imperative petition, now with violent imagery. The opening command שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רָשָׁע (literally "break the arm of the wicked") employs a metaphor of dismantling power. The arm (זְרוֹעַ) throughout Scripture represents strength and the capacity to act (cf. "outstretched arm" as a description of God's power, Exod 6:6; Deut 4:34). To break someone's arm is to remove their ability to harm. The verb שבר (to break, shatter) appears in contexts of military defeat (Jer 48:25: נִשְׁבְּרָה זְרוֹעַ מוֹאָב, "The arm of Moab is broken") and divine judgment (Ezek 30:21-22 describes God breaking Pharaoh's arms).

The phrase isn't unprecedented. In Psalm 37:17, almost identical language appears: זְרוֹעוֹת רְשָׁעִים תִּשָּׁבַרְנָה, "the arms of the wicked will be broken," suggesting this is stock prophetic language for divine judgment disabling the wicked's capacity for violence. Ezekiel 30:21-22 extends the metaphor across two verses, describing God breaking Pharaoh's arm (already fractured) and the strong arm, and scattering Egypt. The image thus has royal-military connotations—breaking the arm of a king is breaking his military might.

What makes the petition morally complex is its violence. The psalmist doesn't ask for the wicked's repentance or conversion but for his violent disabling. This reflects the imprecatory tradition within Psalms, where prayers for the destruction of enemies function as prayers for the end of injustice. The ethical assumption is that the wicked's violence has become so integral to his identity that he cannot be reformed—only dismantled. Medieval commentators struggled with this. Radak suggests the "breaking" could be read metaphorically: שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעוֹ וְתַקְפּוֹ, "break his arm and his strength"—not literal physical maiming but removal of power and influence. The Malbim takes it as political rather than personal: the wicked represents oppressive regimes whose "arm" (military force) must be broken for justice to prevail.

The second colon וָרָע תִּדְרוֹשׁ־רִשְׁעוֹ בַל־תִּמְצָא picks up the verb דרש that has threaded through the psalm. Here's the crucial reversal: the wicked said לֹא תִדְרֹֽשׁ (v. 13, "You do not seek"), but now the psalmist petitions תִּדְרוֹשׁ (imperative: "seek!"). The verb is made emphatic through its direct connection to the noun רִשְׁע ("his wickedness")—seek out, investigate, hold accountable his wickedness. The phrase תִּדְרוֹשׁ רִשְׁעוֹ functions like a legal term: "prosecute his evil," "call his wickedness to account."

The final phrase בַל־תִּמְצָא is syntactically ambiguous. Does it mean "so that You will not find [it]" (purpose clause) or "until You find [it] no more" (result clause)? The traditional reading takes it as result: seek his wickedness thoroughly, exhaustively, until there's none left to find. Radak explains: אִם תִּשְׁבֹּר אֶת זְרוֹעוֹ... לֹא תִמְצָא רָשָׁע בָּאָרֶץ, "If You break his arm... You will not find wickedness in the land." The logic is that breaking the wicked's power (disabling his arm) and thoroughly investigating his crimes (seeking his wickedness) will together result in the elimination of evil—בַל־תִּמְצָא, "You will find none."

The Torah Temimah cites this verse in Brachot 7a and Megillah 17b regarding the structure of the Amidah. The Gemara asks why the blessing against sectarians and informers (Birkat HaMinim) was placed ninth in the Amidah, and answers by citing this verse: כְּנֶגֶד מַפִּיקֵי שְׁעָרִים, "corresponding to those who abuse public authority," and then cites שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רָשָׁע as the scriptural basis for praying against oppressive power. This rabbinic usage demonstrates that the petition wasn't read as personal vengeance but as a prayer for the dismantling of systemic oppression—the "arm" being broken is political power used to harm the vulnerable.

Psalm 10:15 appears in the Ashkenazi Yom Kippur Musaf, specifically in the Seder HaAvodah after the detailed description of the Temple service. Following the narrative of ancient glory, the liturgy shifts to supplication, including this verse in an alphabetical acrostic piyyut: רוּמָה עֻזֶּךָ וְרוֹמֵם שְׁפָלִים; שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רֶשַׁע; תִּמְלֹךְ לְבַדְּךָ בְּקוֹרְאֵי שְׁמֶךָ, "Raise Your might and elevate the lowly; break the arm of the wicked; You alone will reign over those who call Your name." The liturgical usage transforms the verse from individual petition into communal eschatological hope—the day will come when oppressive power is broken and God's kingship alone prevails.

**Verse 16**

יְהֹוָ֣ה מֶ֭לֶךְ עוֹלָ֣ם וָעֶ֑ד; אָבְד֥וּ ג֝וֹיִ֗ם מֵאַרְצֽוֹ׃

"The LORD is King forever and ever; the nations have perished from His land."

This verse erupts as a sudden hymnic declaration, shifting from petition to proclamation. The statement יְהֹוָה מֶלֶךְ (the LORD is King) appears throughout Psalms as a fundamental credal affirmation (Ps 93:1, 96:10, 97:1, 99:1, 146:10). These "enthronement psalms" declare God's cosmic sovereignty, often in contexts of creation and judgment. The formula יְהֹוָה מֶלֶךְ typically introduces a theophanic psalm celebrating God's victorious rule, but here it appears abruptly in the midst of an individual lament, creating a jarring generic rupture.

The phrase עוֹלָם וָעֶד (forever and ever) emphasizes the eternal, unshakeable nature of this kingship. Where the wicked boasted לְדֹר וָדֹר אֲשֶׁר לֹא־בְרָע (v. 6, "through all generations I shall not be in trouble"), claiming his own perpetual stability, the psalmist now asserts God's eternal kingship. The temporal adverbs create a contrast: the wicked's false confidence in his own permanence versus the true permanence of divine rule. The phrase עוֹלָם וָעֶד appears 15 times in Psalms, always in contexts of praise or confidence in God's eternal attributes (Ps 21:5, 45:7, 48:15, 52:10, etc.).

The second colon אָבְדוּ גוֹיִם מֵאַרְצוֹ employs the perfect tense אָבְדוּ ("have perished") in what appears to be a prophetic perfect—grammatically past but referring to a future event viewed as so certain it's described as accomplished. The verb אבד (to perish, be destroyed) is decisive—not "will be defeated" but "will cease to exist." The subject גוֹיִם (nations) is puzzling in context. Earlier verses described an individual wicked person (רָשָׁע). Why suddenly shift to plural "nations"? 

Several interpretations are possible: (1) the wicked individual represents foreign oppressors, so "nations" makes explicit what was implicit; (2) the verse quotes from a separate kingship hymn and has been inserted here for theological effect; (3) "nations" is used idiomatically to mean "the wicked collectively" (as in Ps 9:6, 16, which uses גוֹיִם for enemies); (4) the original context was communal lament against national enemies, and the individual wicked person is the king or leader of these nations.

Rashi reads eschatologically: מֵאַחַר שֶׁיֹּאבְדוּ גוֹיִם מֵאַרְצוֹ, "after the nations perish from His land," suggesting this describes the messianic future when foreign powers will be removed from the land of Israel. This reading connects to texts like Zechariah 14:9: וְהָיָה יְהוָה לְמֶלֶךְ עַל־כָּל־הָאָרֶץ, "And the LORD will be King over all the earth." Ibn Ezra, characteristically rationalist, suggests the verse means simply that when God acts as king, executing justice, then the wicked (called "nations" here) will perish from the earth.

The phrase מֵאַרְצוֹ (from His land) is particularly significant. Is this God's cosmic dominion (the earth as His land) or specifically the land of Israel? The possessive suffix "His land" (ארצו) suggests particular ownership, pointing toward Israel/Zion, but the cosmic context of יְהֹוָה מֶלֶךְ עוֹלָם וָעֶד argues for universal scope. Radak combines both: when God is King, the oppressing nations will perish from the land of Israel, and God's kingship will return to Israel—presumably after exile.

This verse holds a prominent and liturgically strategic position in the Sefardic and Mizrachi rites. It appears in the Pesukei Dezimra (Verses of Praise) of every morning service as part of Yehi Khvod, a curated mosaic of verses celebrating divine majesty. The liturgy places it immediately after the threefold temporal declaration of God's kingship: יְהֹוָה מֶלֶךְ, יְהֹוָה מָלָךְ, יְהֹוָה יִמְלֹךְ לְעֹלָם וָעֶד ("The LORD is King, the LORD was King, the LORD will be King forever and ever"). Our verse follows as the fourth element: יְהֹוָה מֶלֶךְ עוֹלָם וָעֶד אָבְדוּ גוֹיִם מֵאַרְצוֹ, then continues with יְהֹוָה הֵפִיר עֲצַת־גּוֹיִם הֵנִיא מַחְשְׁבוֹת עַמִּים (Ps 33:10), "The LORD foils the counsel of nations." This liturgical placement transforms Psalm 10:16 from a declaration arising from theodicy into a climactic affirmation of God's triumph over earthly powers, structuring the worshipper's consciousness toward divine sovereignty at the beginning of each day.

The genre shift this verse represents is crucial to the psalm's rhetoric. After extensive description of wickedness and earnest petition for divine action, the psalmist doesn't wait for God's answer but declares God's kingship *now*, as if the petition has already been answered. This is what speech-act theorists call a "performative utterance"—the declaration creates the reality it describes. By proclaiming God's kingship in the midst of oppression, the psalmist enacts resistance to the wicked's theology. The wicked said אֵין אֱלֹהִים (v. 4), but the psalmist counters יְהֹוָה מֶלֶךְ. Against empirical evidence, against present suffering, the declaration of divine kingship becomes an act of theological defiance.

**Verse 17**

תַּאֲוַ֬ת עֲנָוִ֣ים שָׁמַ֣עְתָּ יְהֹוָ֑ה; תָּכִ֥ין לִ֝בָּ֗ם תַּקְשִׁ֥יב אׇזְנֶֽךָ׃

"The desire of the lowly You have heard, O LORD; You will establish their heart, You will incline Your ear."

This verse shifts to the language of accomplished confidence, using perfect tense verbs (שָׁמַעְתָּ) and imperfect verbs of assurance (תָּכִין, תַּקְשִׁיב) rather than petition. The opening phrase תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים creates a verbal link back to verse 3, where the wicked boasted עַל־תַּאֲוַת נַפְשׁוֹ (about his soul's desire) and verse 6, where he claimed perpetual security. Now the psalmist asserts that God hears תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים—not the wicked's arrogant desires but the desires of the lowly. The noun תַּאֲוָה denotes "desire, longing, craving"—the same inner yearning, but directed differently. The wicked's תַּאֲוָה is acquisitive and self-serving; the lowly's תַּאֲוָה is for justice, protection, vindication.

The verb שָׁמַעְתָּ (You have heard) is theologically loaded. Throughout Scripture, divine "hearing" (שמע) signals the beginning of redemption. In Exodus 2:24, God "hears" Israel's groaning and remembers His covenant: וַיִּשְׁמַע אֱלֹהִים אֶת־נַאֲקָתָם, "God heard their moaning." The perfect tense here (שָׁמַעְתָּ) functions like רָאִתָה in verse 14—not "You will hear" but "You have heard," asserting an accomplished reality. The act of articulating this psalm *is itself* evidence that God has heard, because the psalmist wouldn't be praying if God didn't listen.

The phrase עֲנָוִים (the lowly, humble) is a Qere/Ketiv variant. The Ketiv reads עניים (aniyim, the poor), while the Qere reads עֲנָוִים (anavim, the lowly/humble). This same textual issue appeared in verse 12. Here, as there, the Qere's preference for עֲנָוִים emphasizes not merely economic poverty but a spiritual posture of humility and dependence on God. Numbers 12:3 famously describes Moses as הָעָנָו מְאֹד מִכֹּל הָאָדָם, "very humble, more than any person on earth," establishing humility as the supreme leadership virtue. The עֲנָוִים are those who, lacking human power, entrust themselves entirely to divine justice—precisely the posture verse 14 described (עָלֶיךָ יַעֲזֹב חֵלֵכָה).

The second colon introduces two future/imperfect verbs describing God's action: תָּכִין לִבָּם (You will establish their heart) and תַּקְשִׁיב אׇזְנֶךָ (You will incline Your ear). The verb כון in the hiphil means "to establish, make firm, prepare." The heart (לֵב) as the seat of will and thought needs divine establishment—the lowly aren't merely heard passively but actively strengthened internally by God's response. Radak glosses: תָּסִיר מִלִּבָּם טִרְדַּת הָעוֹלָם, "You will remove from their hearts the anxiety of the world"—God firms up their inner resolve so they can pray with kavanah (intention/concentration). The image is of God working within the psalmist to enable the very prayer being prayed—a recursivity where prayer itself is God's gift.

The phrase תַּקְשִׁיב אׇזְנֶךָ is a common biblical idiom for attentive listening (cf. Ps 5:2, 17:1, 55:2, 86:6). The hiphil of קשב intensifies the simple "hear"—it means to prick up the ears, to pay close attention, to focus intently. The anthropomorphism of God inclining His ear (like a human leaning closer to hear better) creates intimacy—God bends down to listen to the quiet voice of the afflicted. This contrasts sharply with verse 1's complaint that God stands בְּרָחוֹק (at a distance). Now, though spatially God may be distant, attentively He is near—His ear is inclined.

This verse appears in multiple liturgical contexts, demonstrating its centrality to Jewish prayer theology. Most prominently, the phrase תָּכִין לִבָּם תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ appears in the High Holiday liturgy during the chazan's repetition of the Amidah. Both Ashkenazi and Edot HaMizrach traditions include it as the prayer leader declares his unworthiness: לְחַלּוֹתְךָ שְׁלָחֽוּנִי מַקְהֲלוֹת הֲמוֹנֶֽךָ. תָּכִין לִבָּם תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶֽךָ, "Your teeming congregations have sent me to entreat You. Prepare their heart; incline Your ear." The liturgical shift from first person (their heart) to second person (Your ear) creates a chiasm—the community's hearts need firming, God's ear needs inclining—suggesting that effective prayer requires divine action at both ends. The worshippers can't pray properly without God preparing their hearts, and their prayers can't be heard without God inclining His ear.

The verse also appears in the Edot HaMizrach Simchat Torah Hakafot during the first circuit, associated kabbalistically with the sefirah of Malkhut (Kingship). The liturgy quotes: ...וַאֲנִי כְּזַיִת רַעֲנָן בְּבֵית אֱלֹהִים, בָּטַחְתִּי בְּחֶסֶד אֱלֹהִים עוֹלָם וָעֶד. תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים שָׁמַעְתָּ יְהֹוָה, תָּכִין לִבָּם תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ, "But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in God's mercy forever and ever. The desire of the humble You have heard, O LORD; You prepare their heart, You incline Your ear." This placement links the verse to joyous celebration rather than suffering, demonstrating its liturgical flexibility—it can express confidence in any circumstance.

The shift in verb tenses throughout the verse (perfect שָׁמַעְתָּ, imperfect תָּכִין, תַּקְשִׁיב) creates a timeline of divine action: You *have* heard (past), You *will* establish (future), You *will* incline (future/habitual). This grammatical progression suggests that hearing is the first divine response, followed by strengthening and continued attentive listening—a sequence that models how God responds to prayer.

**Verse 18**

לִשְׁפֹּ֥ט יָת֗וֹם וָ֫דָ֥ךְ; בַּל־יוֹסִ֥יף ע֑וֹד לַעֲרֹ֥ץ אֱ֝נ֗וֹשׁ מִן־הָאָֽרֶץ׃

"To champion the orphan and the downtrodden; that men of the earth tyrannize no more."

This final verse articulates the purpose (לִשְׁפֹּט) of God's attentive hearing: to execute justice for the most vulnerable. The infinitive construct לִשְׁפֹּט (to judge, to vindicate, to champion) takes יָתוֹם וָדָךְ as its object—the orphan and the downtrodden. The orphan (יָתוֹם) appeared once before, in verse 14, where God was declared to have been the orphan's helper (עוֹזֵר). Now the orphan reappears as the primary beneficiary of divine justice. Torah legislation repeatedly commands protection of the orphan, pairing him with the widow and stranger as those lacking familial/communal protection (Exod 22:21-23; Deut 10:18, 14:29, 16:11, 14, 24:17-21, 26:12-13, 27:19). The orphan represents not a random victim but a covenant category—God has bound Himself by law to defend those without human defenders.

The noun דָּךְ (downtrodden, crushed, oppressed) appears only in Psalms (9:10, 10:18, 74:21) and Isaiah (57:15), suggesting poetic vocabulary. It comes from the root דכא (to crush, be crushed), and describes those ground down by oppression—those whose spirits have been broken. The pairing יָתוֹם וָדָךְ creates a hendiadys: the fatherless are ipso facto crushed by their social vulnerability. Together they represent the bottom of the social hierarchy, those with no advocate, no inheritance, no voice in the gates.

The verb שָׁפַט deserves close attention. While English "judge" suggests neutral adjudication, biblical שָׁפַט in contexts involving the powerless means "to vindicate, to champion, to deliver justice *for*" (not merely *to*). The judge (שׁוֹפֵט) isn't a neutral arbiter but an active advocate for the oppressed party. This is clear from Deuteronomy 10:18: עֹשֶׂה מִשְׁפַּט יָתוֹם וְאַלְמָנָה, "He executes justice for the orphan and widow"—not "He judges between the orphan and someone else" but "He secures justice on behalf of the orphan." The psalm ends with this vision: God standing as legal advocate for those who have no other.

The second colon describes the negative purpose—what will cease: בַּל־יוֹסִיף עוֹד לַעֲרֹץ אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָרֶץ. The phrase בַּל־יוֹסִיף עוֹד creates a double negative: "will not continue/add again"—emphatic cessation. What will cease is לַעֲרֹץ (to terrify, to strike terror, to tyrannize). This verb ערץ appears only 5 times in Scripture (Deut 1:29, 7:21, 20:3, 31:6; Isa 8:12, 47:12; Job 13:25), always in contexts of fear before a powerful threat—either military enemies or divine majesty. Here the subject is אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָרֶץ (man from/of the earth), and the meaning is that this "earthly man" will no longer strike terror.

The phrase אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָרֶץ is the psalm's final theological statement, and it's crucial. The noun אֱנוֹשׁ (often translated "man, mortal, human") emphasizes human weakness and mortality in contrast to divine eternality (cf. Ps 8:5, 9:20-21, 90:3, 103:15). When paired with מִן־הָאָרֶץ (from/of the earth), it stresses human earthiness, creaturely limitation, mortality. This stands in deliberate contrast to verse 16's declaration that יְהֹוָה מֶלֶךְ עוֹלָם וָעֶד ("the LORD is King forever and ever"). God is eternal king; man is of the earth, mortal, transient. Ibn Ezra captures this: אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָרֶץ emphasizes that humans are earthborn and will return to earth—they have no inherent right to terrorize others because they themselves are fragile and temporary.

Radak notes that the phrase also implies that the tyrant's power comes *from the earth*—from earthly resources, weapons, alliances—not from heaven. This makes the tyranny doubly outrageous: one mortal terrorizing another mortal, one earthly creature lording it over another earthly creature, when both are dust and to dust will return. The solution is divine intervention: only the eternal King can stop the earthly tyrant.

The verse's purpose clause (לִשְׁפֹּט...בַּל־יוֹסִיף) creates an eschatological vision—not merely "God will judge this particular wicked person" but "God will judge in such a way that tyranny itself ceases." The future envisioned is not return to a prelapsarian Eden but movement toward a world where לַעֲרֹץ אֱנוֹשׁ (the terrorizing of mortals) is structurally impossible because divine justice has become so manifest that no mortal dares tyrannize another. This is why verse 16's kingship declaration stands before this verse—only God's kingship can end human tyranny.

The psalm thus ends not with resolution (the wicked has not yet been destroyed) but with vision. The structure is: (1) lament about present reality (vv. 1-11); (2) petition for divine action (vv. 12-15); (3) declaration of faith despite appearances (v. 16); (4) confidence in God's hearing (v. 17); (5) vision of justice's ultimate triumph (v. 18). The broken acrostic structure—with its missing stanzas—remains broken, suggesting that the alphabet of justice is incomplete in this age. But the psalm asserts that God's kingship guarantees its eventual completion: אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָרֶץ will tyrannize no more.

This ending makes Psalm 10 not merely a complaint or petition but a paradigmatic prayer for all who suffer under oppression. Its refusal to resolve empirically (the wicked still prospers, God still seems distant) combined with its theological assertion (God is King, God hears, tyranny will end) creates a template for living in the tension between present suffering and future hope. The psalm doesn't offer cheap comfort or premature closure. It offers something more valuable: language for truthful protest, theological resources for resisting despair, and a vision of justice that sustains faith even when vindication is delayed.

## Analytical Framework for Biblical Poetry

Concepts and Analytical Frameworks for Biblical Poetry: A Foundational Document for the Telescopic Analysis of the PsalmsPreamble: Purpose and Methodological StanceThis document serves as the core knowledge base for an AI-powered commentary pipeline, designed to facilitate a literary-poetic analysis of the Book of Psalms. Its structure is optimized for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to provide precise, context-rich information on the artistic conventions of biblical Hebrew poetry. The methodological stance is inspired by the literary approach of scholars like Robert Alter, which treats the biblical text as a work of sophisticated literary art.1 This framework posits that poetic form is not a decorative embellishment but the primary vehicle of meaning and theological expression.3 The objective is to equip analytical agents to move beyond surface-level paraphrase to a "telescopic analysis"—a method that connects micro-level poetic devices (e.g., a single word choice, a metaphor) to the macro-level thematic and theological arguments of an entire psalm.I. The Foundational Principle: ParallelismParallelism is the most fundamental and pervasive organizing principle of biblical Hebrew poetry.5 An analysis of its dynamic nature is the prerequisite for any meaningful literary interpretation. It is a "seconding sequence" where the relationship between the parts of a line, rather than rhyme or a strict meter, creates the poetic effect.6The Dynamics of Parallelism: Defining the "A is so, and what's more, B" PrincipleThe core dynamic of parallelism is not simple repetition but a progression of thought, aptly summarized by the principle "A is so, and what's more, B." In this model, the second part of a poetic line, or colon, dynamically engages with the first. It can confirm, sharpen, specify, intensify, contrast, or complete the initial statement.4 This functional understanding represents a significant development from earlier, more static classificatory approaches, which identified types of parallelism but often under-analyzed their rhetorical purpose.2 The energy of a poetic line sweeps from the first colon to the second, creating a forward momentum that can develop an argument or unfold "miniature stories".4 This principle forces the reader—or an AI agent—to locate the primary locus of meaning in the relationship between the cola, treating them not as isolated statements but as an integrated, developing thought.10 It is the essential "rhyme of thought" that defines Hebrew verse.11Synonymous ParallelismConcept Name: Synonymous ParallelismDefinition: A form of parallelism where the second colon restates, echoes, or reinforces the thought of the first colon using different but semantically equivalent words or concepts.5Function in Poetry: The function of synonymous parallelism is rarely simple tautology. It serves to reinforce and amplify an idea, adding emotional depth and aesthetic beauty that makes the message more memorable and impactful.12 Frequently, the second colon achieves this by intensifying the first or by moving from a general term to a more specific or concrete image, making the concept more pointed and forceful.7 This progression from general to particular is a key dynamic of biblical poetry.Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 19:1: "הַשָּׁמַיִם מְסַפְּרִים כְּבוֹד-אֵל // וּמַעֲשֵׂה יָדָיו מַגִּיד הָרָקִיעַ."6Psalm 24:1: "לַיהוָה הָאָרֶץ וּמְלוֹאָהּ // תֵּבֵל וְיֹשְׁבֵי בָהּ."13Psalm 120:2: "יְהוָה הַצִּילָה נַפְשִׁי מִשְּׂפַת-שֶׁקֶר // מִלָּשׁוֹן רְמִיָּה."12Analytical Questions:How does the second colon restate the first? Does it use direct synonyms or related concepts?Does the second colon specify, intensify, or make the first more concrete? If so, what is the effect of this shift?What nuances of meaning are introduced by the specific word choices in the second colon that are not present in the first?Does the second line simply repeat the first, or does it heighten the idea or emotion?Antithetic ParallelismConcept Name: Antithetic ParallelismDefinition: A form of parallelism where the second colon presents a thought that is in direct contrast or opposition to the first.5 The contrast is often, but not always, marked by a conjunction such as "but".11Function in Poetry: This device sharpens an idea by defining it against its opposite. The use of opposites clarifies both extremes, creating a starker focus on the desired message and forcing a moral or theological choice.16 It is a favored device in wisdom literature for framing the two paths of life—for example, righteousness versus wickedness, or wisdom versus folly—thereby creating tension and emphasizing the consequences of a decision.5Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 1:6: "כִּי-יוֹדֵעַ יְהוָה דֶּרֶךְ צַדִּיקִים // וְדֶרֶךְ רְשָׁעִים תֹּאבֵד."11Psalm 20:7: "אֵלֶּה בָרֶכֶב וְאֵלֶּה בַסּוּסִים // וַאֲנַחְנוּ בְּשֵׁם-יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ נַזְכִּיר."20Psalm 34:10: "כְּפִירִים רָשׁוּ וְרָעֵבוּ // וְדֹרְשֵׁי יְהוָה לֹא-יַחְסְרוּ כָל-טוֹב."16Analytical Questions:What two concepts, paths, or outcomes are being contrasted in this verse?How does the contrast in the second colon clarify or sharpen the meaning of the first?What is the central idea that is being defined by this opposition?Is the contrast marked by a conjunction like "but," or is it implied by the juxtaposition of the two lines?Synthetic (or Climactic/Staircase) ParallelismConcept Name: Synthetic (or Climactic/Staircase) ParallelismDefinition: A form of parallelism where the second colon does not restate or contrast the first but instead builds upon, extends, or completes its thought.5 The climactic or "staircase" variation is a specific type where a key word or phrase from the first colon is repeated in the second, which then adds new information to build toward a climax or completion.8Function in Poetry: This form creates narrative or logical progression within the poetic line itself, developing an argument, explaining a cause and effect, or building emotional intensity step-by-step.23 It is the most explicit embodiment of the "A is so, and what's more, B" principle, as the second line carries the thought of the first to its conclusion.Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 29:1-2: "הָבוּ לַיהוָה בְּנֵי אֵלִים // הָבוּ לַיהוָה כָּבוֹד וָעֹז. // הָבוּ לַיהוָה כְּבוֹד שְׁמוֹ..."23Psalm 14:2: "יְהוָה מִשָּׁמַיִם הִשְׁקִיף עַל-בְּנֵי-אָדָם // לִרְאוֹת הֲיֵשׁ מַשְׂכִּיל דֹּרֵשׁ אֶת-אֱלֹהִים."22Psalm 96:1-2: "שִׁירוּ לַיהוָה שִׁיר חָדָשׁ // שִׁירוּ לַיהוָה כָּל-הָאָרֶץ. // שִׁירוּ לַיהוָה בָּרְכוּ שְׁמוֹ..."20Analytical Questions:How does the second colon build upon or complete the thought of the first?Is there a cause-and-effect relationship, a question-and-answer, or a sequential development being presented?In climactic forms, what key term is repeated, and what new information is added to create a sense of rising intensity or completion?How does this progression contribute to the overall argument of the psalm?II. Poetic Diction: Economy and ConcretenessThe characteristic style of Hebrew poetry favors compact expression and tangible imagery, creating a discourse that is both dense and emotionally resonant.Terseness & ConcisenessConcept Name: Terseness & ConcisenessDefinition: A primary characteristic of biblical Hebrew poetry is its compressed and economical use of language, employing a minimum of words to express complex ideas.2 This is often achieved through the omission of common prose particles (such as the definite article or direct object marker) and conjunctions, and through the use of ellipsis, where a word from the first colon (frequently the verb) is omitted but understood in the second.6Function in Poetry: Terseness creates a heightened, dense form of discourse that focuses attention on the most semantically important words.2 By omitting explicit logical connectors, the poet forces the reader to deduce the relationship between cola from the parallel structure itself, thereby empowering the function of parallelism. This word economy also contributes to the accentual rhythm of the verse by keeping lines short and impactful.2 Imagery, in this context, becomes a primary tool for compactness, allowing the poet to communicate a rich message in very few words.14Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 114:4: "הֶהָרִים רָקְדוּ כְאֵילִים // גְּבָעוֹת כִּבְנֵי-צֹאן."25Psalm 23:1: "יְהוָה רֹעִי // לֹא אֶחְסָר."Psalm 1:3: "וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל-פַּלְגֵי מָיִם // אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ."Analytical Questions:Are there words (especially verbs or conjunctions) from the first colon that are omitted but implied in the second? What is the effect of this ellipsis?How does the economy of words force a greater focus on the key nouns and verbs that are present?Does the terseness create ambiguity, or does it sharpen the focus and impact of the verse?How does the poet use a single image to convey a complex idea concisely?Concrete ImageryConcept Name: Concrete ImageryDefinition: Hebrew poetry demonstrates a marked preference for conveying theological ideas, emotional states, and moral principles through concrete, physical, and sensory images rather than through abstract philosophical or theological language.29 The ancient Hebrew imagination engaged the world not through abstract categories but through the empirical knowledge of lived experience—the life of shepherds, warriors, farmers, and priests.3Function in Poetry: Concrete images make abstract concepts tangible, emotionally resonant, and memorable.15 They ground theological claims in the physical world, allowing the poet to explore complex spiritual states through a shared, sensory vocabulary. Transforming a general term into a concrete image makes the idea "more pointed, more forceful".9 This imagery is not merely ornamental but functional, expressing significant themes and conveying implicit value judgments.30 For example, the choice between pastoral, military, or cultic imagery frames the psalmist's problem and the desired divine response.Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 18:2: "יְהוָה סַלְעִי וּמְצוּדָתִי וּמְפַלְטִי // אֵלִי צוּרִי אֶחֱסֶה-בּוֹ // מָגִנִּי וְקֶרֶן-יִשְׁעִי מִשְׂגַּבִּי."25Psalm 23:1-3: "יְהוָה רֹעִי... בִּנְאוֹת דֶּשֶׁא יַרְבִּיצֵנִי עַל-מֵי מְנֻחוֹת יְנַהֲלֵנִי..."33Psalm 1:3: "וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל-פַּלְgֵי מָיִם..."34Analytical Questions:What concrete, physical image is being used in this verse? What senses does it appeal to (sight, sound, touch)?What abstract theological, emotional, or moral concept does this image represent?What specific attributes of the concrete image are being mapped onto the abstract concept (e.g., a rock's stability, a shield's protection, a tree's fruitfulness)?How does the domain of the imagery (e.g., nature, warfare, temple cult) contribute to the overall argument or emotional tone of the psalm?III. The Music of Language: Sound and WordplayThese devices leverage the phonetic qualities of the Hebrew language to create artistic effects that enhance meaning and memorability. While often lost in translation, an awareness of their function is crucial for appreciating the original artistry.ParonomasiaConcept Name: ParonomasiaDefinition: The use of words that are similar in sound but different in meaning to create a "wordplay" or "pun".35 It is a deliberate juxtaposition of like-sounding words that draws the reader's attention to a particular statement or connection.37Function in Poetry: Paronomasia forges an associative link between two otherwise disparate concepts, prompting the reader to consider their relationship. It adds a layer of wit, memorability, and rhetorical force, often underscoring a solemn or important statement that might otherwise be overlooked.35Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 56:8: "נֹדִי סָפַרְתָּה-אָתָּה // שִׂימָה דִמְעָתִי בְנֹאדֶךָ." The similar sounds of the Hebrew words for "my wanderings" ($nōdî$) and "in your bottle" ($bənōdekā$) phonetically link the cause (wandering) with the effect (tears) that God is said to collect and remember.35Psalm 96:5: "כִּי כָּל-אֱלֹהֵי הָעַמִּים אֱלִילִים // וַיהוָה שָׁמַיִם עָשָׂה." This is a common prophetic wordplay contrasting the true God ($'elohim$) with "worthless things" ($'elilim$).Analytical Questions:(For Hebrew text analysis) Are there words in close proximity that share similar root consonants or sounds but have different meanings?What new connection or idea is suggested by the phonetic link between these words?How does this wordplay contribute to the verse's rhetorical force, memorability, or theological argument?Alliteration & AssonanceConcept Name: Alliteration & AssonanceDefinition: Alliteration is the repetition of the same or similar consonant sounds in nearby words, typically at the beginning of words. Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds within nearby words.38 While not a primary structural principle in Hebrew poetry, these sound devices are common and are used for aesthetic and emphatic effect.25Function in Poetry: These devices enhance the musicality and oral-aural quality of the poetry, making it more pleasing to the ear and more memorable.38 They can be used to link key words together, create emphasis on a particular phrase, and contribute to the emotional texture of a line. The sound itself can be mimetic, with the phonetic quality reinforcing the semantic meaning (e.g., harsh sounds for judgment, soft sounds for lament).41Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 29:1: In the Hebrew phrase kavod vā'oz (כָּבוֹד וָעֹז), the repetition of the 'o' vowel sound is an example of assonance.42Psalm 122:6: Sha'alu shalom Yerushalayim (שַׁאֲלוּ שְׁלוֹם יְרוּשָׁלָ‍ִם) features prominent alliteration of the 'sh' ($š$) and 'l' sounds.Psalm 6:6 (Hebrew 6:7): 'aśḥeh bəkol-laylāh miṭṭātî (אַשְׂחֶה בְכָל-לַיְלָה מִטָּתִי). The line is rich with sibilant 's' ($s/ś$) sounds, phonetically mimicking the sound of weeping or sighing.Analytical Questions:(For Hebrew text analysis) Is there a noticeable repetition of a particular consonant or vowel sound in this line or verse?Which words are linked by this sound repetition, and what is the significance of that link?How does the sound itself (e.g., a harsh guttural vs. a soft sibilant) contribute to the mood or meaning of the line?IV. Figurative Language: The Architecture of MeaningThis section covers devices that convey meaning by describing one thing in terms of another, creating rich layers of significance and enabling the poet to articulate complex truths.Metaphor & SimileConcept Name: Metaphor & SimileDefinition: Both are figures of speech that draw a comparison between two essentially different things to highlight a point of similarity. A simile makes the comparison explicit by using a comparative term such as "like" or "as." A metaphor makes the comparison implicitly, often by stating that A is B.34 While formally distinct, their poetic function is largely the same: to generate new understanding through analogy.44Function in Poetry: Metaphor and simile are central to poetic expression, transforming abstract concepts into concrete, understandable, and memorable images.34 They function by inviting the reader to transfer attributes from a familiar source domain (e.g., a shepherd) to a less familiar target domain (e.g., God) to generate new insight.44 They are the primary linguistic tools for expressing the ineffable nature of God and the depth of human spiritual experience, which defy literal description.15Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Simile: Psalm 1:3: "וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל-פַּלְגֵי מָיִם..."25Simile: Psalm 42:1: "כְּאַיָּל תַּעֲרֹג עַל-אֲפִיקֵי-מָיִם כֵּן נַפְשִׁי תַעֲרֹג אֵלֶיךָ אֱלֹהִים."11Metaphor: Psalm 23:1: "יְהוָה רֹעִי."15Metaphor: Psalm 84:11: "כִּי שֶׁמֶשׁ וּמָגֵן יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים."11Analytical Questions:What two things are being compared? Identify the target (the main subject) and the source (what it's being compared to).What specific characteristics of the source domain are being transferred to the target domain?How does this comparison help to understand the target (e.g., God, the psalmist's soul) in a new or deeper way?Is this a standalone figure of speech, or is it part of an extended metaphor that develops across several verses?MerismConcept Name: MerismDefinition: A figure of speech in which a totality or whole is expressed by naming two opposite, contrasting, or complementary parts.46Function in Poetry: Merism is a poetic and compact rhetorical device for expressing completeness or all-encompassing scope ("everything"). By naming the boundaries or polar extremes of a category (e.g., "day and night," "heaven and earth"), it implies everything contained within them, creating a sense of totality and amplification.46Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 139:2: "אַתָּה יָדַעְתָּ שִׁבְתִּי וְקוּמִי..."Psalm 121:6: "יוֹמָם הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ לֹא-יַכֶּכָּה וְיָרֵחַ בַּלָּיְלָה."46Psalm 121:8: "יְהוָה יִשְׁמָר-צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ..."46Analytical Questions:What are the two opposite or complementary poles mentioned in the text?What is the whole or totality that these two extremes are meant to represent?How does using a merism create a sense of all-encompassing scope for the action or attribute being described?PersonificationConcept Name: PersonificationDefinition: The attribution of human qualities, actions, emotions, or consciousness to inanimate objects, animals, or abstract concepts.11Function in Poetry: Personification enlivens the poetic world, creating a dramatic and vivid landscape where all of creation can participate in the relationship with God. It is a powerful tool for reinforcing themes of God's universal sovereignty by depicting nature as an active participant in praise or judgment.50 It can also make abstract concepts like "justice," "peace," or "steadfast love" into active agents within a poetic narrative.50Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 98:8: "נְהָרוֹת יִמְחֲאוּ-כָף, יַחַד הָרִים יְרַנֵּנוּ."50Psalm 19:1-2: "הַשָּׁמַיִם מְסַפְּרִים כְּבוֹד-אֵל... יוֹם לְיוֹם יַבִּיעַ אֹמֶר..."50Psalm 85:10: "חֶסֶד-וֶאֱמֶת נִפְגָּשׁוּ; צֶדֶק וְשָׁלוֹם נָשָׁקוּ."50Analytical Questions:What non-human entity is being given human attributes or actions?What specific human quality (e.g., speech, emotion, action) is being attributed to it?What is the poetic or theological effect of this personification? Does it make creation seem more alive, an abstract concept more active, or God's power more pervasive?V. Macro-Structures: Poetic Form and FramingThese devices organize larger blocks of text—from a few lines to an entire psalm—creating patterns that guide the reader, build emphasis, and unify the composition.Chiasmus (Chiastic Structure)Concept Name: Chiasmus (Chiastic Structure)Definition: An inverted literary structure in which a sequence of elements (words, phrases, or themes) is presented and then repeated in reverse order, creating a mirrored pattern such as A-B-B'-A' or A-B-C-B'-A'.51 The name is derived from the Greek letter Chi ($X$), which the pattern resembles when diagrammed, as lines can be drawn connecting the parallel elements.53Function in Poetry: Chiasmus is a sophisticated device used for emphasis, memorization, and to highlight the central element of the structure (the pivot or turning point), which often contains the main idea of the passage.53 By forcing the reader to process the logic of the poem both forwards and backwards, it underscores the unity of the composition and directs attention to its theological or emotional core.53Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Micro-Chiasm: Psalm 2:10: "וְעַתָּה מְלָכִים (A), הַשְׂכִּילוּ (B); // הִוָּסְרוּ (B'), שֹׁפְטֵי אָרֶץ (A')".53Macro-Chiasm: Psalm 8 is structured as a large-scale chiasm. It is framed by praise of God's name (A, v. 1 and A', v. 9), which envelops reflections on God's glory in the heavens (B, vv. 1-3) and humanity's rule on earth (B', vv. 6-8), with the central question about humanity's significance (C, vv. 4-5) at its core.53Thematic Chiasm: Psalm 106 embeds its historical narrative within a chiastic structure of key themes and repeated words, drawing attention to central motifs like Moses's intercession and the sin at Baal-Peor.55Analytical Questions:Are there repeated words, phrases, or ideas that appear in a mirrored or inverted order (A-B...B'-A')?What is the central element of the chiasm? How is it emphasized by the surrounding structure?How do the corresponding pairs (A and A', B and B') relate to each other? Does the second element resolve, expand upon, or reflect on the first?Inclusio (Envelope Structure)Concept Name: Inclusio (Envelope Structure)Definition: A literary device where a section of text is "bracketed" or "enveloped" by repeating the same or a very similar word, phrase, or theme at both the beginning and the end.56Function in Poetry: Inclusio serves to unify a poetic unit, clearly marking its beginning and end for the reader or listener.57 It highlights the central theme encapsulated within the "envelope" and encourages the interpretation of the intervening material in light of the framing statement.56 The meaning of the repeated phrase is often enriched or deepened by the content it encloses, so its final appearance carries more weight than its first.59Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 8: Begins and ends with the identical line: "יְהוָה אֲדֹנֵינוּ מָה-אַדִּיר שִׁמְךָ בְּכָל-הָאָרֶץ!" (vv. 1, 9).57Psalm 103: Begins and ends with the exhortation "בָּרְכִי נַפְשִׁי אֶת-יְהוָה" (vv. 1, 22), framing a lengthy recitation of God's benefits and merciful character.58Psalm 118: Begins and ends with the liturgical call to worship: "הוֹדוּ לַיהוָה כִּי-טוֹב כִּי לְעוֹלָם חַסְדּוֹ" (vv. 1, 29).56Analytical Questions:Does the same or a similar line, phrase, or key theme appear at both the beginning and the end of this psalm or stanza?What is the main idea of the material contained within this "envelope"?How does the repetition of the framing device guide the interpretation of the central content?Is the meaning of the closing phrase identical to the opening one, or has it been deepened by the intervening text?RefrainConcept Name: RefrainDefinition: A line, part of a line, or a group of lines repeated at regular or strategic intervals within a poem, functioning similarly to a chorus in a modern song.54Function in Poetry: A refrain serves as a primary structural marker, dividing a psalm into distinct stanzas or sections.63 Thematically, it often encapsulates the central plea, affirmation of trust, or core theme of the psalm, reinforcing it through repetition and providing an anchor point for the reader's attention and emotion.65Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalms 42-43: The refrain "מַה-תִּשְׁתּוֹחֲחִי נַפְשִׁי וַתֶּהֱמִי עָלָי הוֹחִילִי לֵאלֹהִים כִּי-עוֹד אוֹדֶנּוּ יְשׁוּעֹת פָּנַי וֵאלֹהָי" appears three times (42:5, 42:11; 43:5), structuring the poem and tracing the psalmist's internal struggle and self-exhortation.62Psalm 46: The refrain "יְהוָה צְבָאוֹת עִמָּנוּ מִשְׂגָּב-לָנוּ אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב סֶלָה" appears after the second and third stanzas (vv. 7, 11), acting as a powerful, climactic affirmation of trust.62Psalm 136: The refrain "כִּי לְעוֹלָם חַסְדּוֹ" is repeated after every single colon, making it the dominant structural and theological statement of the entire psalm.65Analytical Questions:Is there a line or phrase that repeats at key junctures in the psalm?How does this refrain divide the psalm into larger structural units (stanzas)?What is the central message of the refrain, and how does its repetition shape the psalm's overall theme and emotional trajectory?VI. Rhythm and CadenceThis section addresses the prosody of Hebrew poetry, clarifying the scholarly consensus on its distinctive rhythmic nature, which is tied more to logic and stress than to syllable counts.Meter & RhythmConcept Name: Meter & RhythmDefinition: Unlike much Western poetry that relies on a strict syllabic meter (a fixed number of syllables per line), the scholarly consensus is that biblical Hebrew poetry is based on an accentual rhythm.68 This means the rhythm is determined by the number of stressed or accented syllables per colon, with the number of unstressed syllables in between being variable.68 This rhythm is not an independent system imposed on the words; rather, it is an emergent property of the parallel structure itself. Because parallel lines often use parallel syntax (e.g., Noun-Verb-Object // Noun-Verb-Object), they naturally result in a similar number of stressed words, creating a "rhythm of thought" or syntactic rhythm.6Function in Poetry: The accentual rhythm creates a distinct cadence and pace appropriate for oral recitation and liturgy. The balance of stresses between the two cola of a line is a key component of parallelism, reinforcing the semantic relationship with a phonetic one. This gives the poetry a powerful, incantatory quality that enhances its emotional impact and aids in memorization.69Canonical Examples (from Psalms): (Note: Stress patterns are most apparent in Hebrew but can be approximated in translation by focusing on major content words.)Psalm 23:1: "יְהוָה רֹעִי // לֹא אֶחְסָר."Psalm 19:1: "הַשָּׁמַיִם מְסַפְּרִים כְּבוֹד-אֵל // וּמַעֲשֵׂה יָדָיו מַגִּיד הָרָקִיעַ."Analytical Questions:When reading the line aloud, how many major stressed words or syllables are in the first colon versus the second?Is there a sense of rhythmic balance, or does one colon feel significantly longer or heavier than the other? How does this affect the meaning?How does the rhythm contribute to the overall feeling or impact of the line (e.g., is it stately and balanced, urgent and short, or falling in a lamenting cadence)?How does the grammatical structure of each colon contribute to its rhythmic feel?

## Traditional Commentaries

Classical interpretations from traditional Jewish commentators on key verses.

### About the Commentators

#### 1. Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki (Rashi)

Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki (1040–1105), known as Rashi, is the foundational commentator of Jewish tradition. Living in Troyes, France, his life and work were profoundly shaped by the communal precariousness following the massacres of the First Crusade. This context fueled his pedagogical mission: to make the core Jewish texts, the Tanakh and the Babylonian Talmud, accessible to ensure the continuity of Jewish knowledge. His commentaries on both became indispensable, with his Talmud commentary being printed in every subsequent edition and his Tanakh commentary holding the distinction of being the first Hebrew book ever printed (1475).

Rashi's exegetical method is a revolutionary synthesis of *peshat* (plain, contextual meaning) and *derash* (rabbinic homiletics). While he stated his goal was *peshat*, his genius was not in literalism but in *curation*. He possessed an uncanny ability to anticipate a student's question—a textual redundancy, an awkward phrase, or a narrative difficulty—and would then select a concise midrashic teaching that "settles" this specific problem. Thus, *derash* is not used as a replacement for the plain meaning but as a tool to reveal a deeper coherence *within* the *peshat*. He anchors the Oral Law within the Written Law, demonstrating their inseparability. To aid his local French-speaking audience, he frequently translated difficult Hebrew terms into Old French using Hebrew letters (*la'azim*), a practice that made his work an invaluable resource for modern linguists. His philosophy was his pedagogy; he was not a formal philosopher but an educator driven by a desire to empower every Jew to study. His legacy is one of total saturation; all subsequent Jewish commentary is, in some form, a dialogue with Rashi.

#### 2. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra

Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra (c.1092–1167) represents the zenith of the "Golden Age" of Spanish Jewry. A consummate polymath, he was a master of grammar, philosophy, mathematics, and astrology. After personal tragedies, he spent the second half of his life as an itinerant scholar, wandering through Christian Europe and acting as an intellectual bridge, introducing the sophisticated Sephardic grammatical and scientific traditions to the Jews of France, Italy, and England. His scholarly corpus is vast, including foundational works on Hebrew grammar, Neoplatonic philosophy (*Yesod Mora*), and scientific tracts that introduced the decimal system to European Jews.

His philosophy was a thoroughgoing rationalism, famously stating the "intellect must be the intermediary between man and his God." This rationalism included a deep, scientific belief in astrology, which he viewed as the deterministic physics of the cosmos; the *mitzvot* (commandments), in his view, were divine tools to mitigate this astral determinism. His exegetical method is a conscious and sharp polemic against Rashi's *peshat/derash* synthesis. For Ibn Ezra, the *peshat* is discoverable only through rigorous, scientific mastery of Hebrew grammar and linguistics, and he famously rejects any rabbinic interpretation that "flies in the face of reason." His commentary is concise, witty, and often enigmatic, frequently hinting at controversial ideas with the phrase, "and the intelligent will understand" (*ve-hamaskil yavin*). Scholars agree he was alluding to conclusions that form the basis of modern biblical criticism, such as post-Mosaic authorship of certain verses and the existence of a Deutero-Isaiah. His legacy is the creation of the competing rationalist-grammatical school of exegesis.

#### 3. Rabbi David Kimhi (Radak)

Rabbi David Kimhi (1160–1235), or Radak, was a product of the unique intellectual climate of 13th-century Provence, a "geographic and intellectual crossroads" mediating between the Talmudism of Northern France (Rashi) and the rationalism of Spain (Ibn Ezra). A staunch defender of Maimonides during the Maimonidean Controversy, Radak's primary field was philology. His grammatical treatise, *Sefer Mikhlol*, and his lexicon, *Sefer Ha-Shorashim*, synthesized and systematized Hebrew grammar with such unparalleled clarity that they became the definitive Hebrew textbooks for centuries.

Radak applied this "genius for clarification" to his biblical commentaries, most notably on the *Nevi'im* (Prophets). His exegetical approach represents the "golden mean" of medieval exegesis. He follows the methodology of Ibn Ezra, with a profound commitment to *peshat*, grammatical precision, and a Maimonidean rationalist philosophy. However, unlike the polemical Ibn Ezra, Radak comfortably integrates all his predecessors. He presents the grammatical *peshat* with the accessibility of Rashi and respectfully utilizes rabbinic *derash*, which he clearly distinguishes from the plain meaning. He provides the necessary linguistic, historical, and geographical context to make the prophetic books understandable. His commentary on *Nevi'im* became as standard as Rashi's on the Torah. Because of its clarity and precision, Radak's work became the primary resource for the Christian Hebraists of the Renaissance and Reformation, heavily influencing the translators of the King James Version of the Bible. He remains indispensable for any serious study of the Prophets.

#### 4. Rabbi Menachem ben Solomon (Meiri)

Rabbi Menachem ben Solomon (1249–1316), the Meiri, was a leading Maimonidean rationalist in 13th-century Provence, living at the height of the Maimonidean Controversy. His magnum opus is the *Beit HaBechirah* ("The Chosen House"), a monumental, encyclopedic digest of the Talmud. This work, which was lost for centuries and only rediscovered in the 20th century, is not a line-by-line commentary like Rashi's. Instead, it is a systematic, topical summary. The Meiri omits the "give and take" of the Talmudic debate and instead presents a lucid summary of the entire subject, collating the opinions of all preceding authorities (whom he refers to by epithets, not names) before concluding with the final *halachic* (legal) decision. This work is the ultimate expression of his Maimonidean worldview, imposing a clear, logical, and rational order on the vast sea of the Talmud.

The Meiri's most radical and enduring innovation is his *halachic* position on non-Jews. The Talmud contains discriminatory laws against ancient *akum* (idolaters). The Meiri was the first major authority to rule that these laws were entirely obsolete. He did this by positing a revolutionary *halachic* category: "nations restricted by the ways of religion" (*umot ha-gedurot be-darkhei ha-datot*). He argued that the Talmud's "idolater" was a moral, not theological, category referring to lawless, barbaric ancient peoples. Contemporary Christians and Muslims, by contrast, are governed by *dat* (law, reason, and social order). Because they live by a system of law and morality, the Meiri ruled they are to be treated as equals to Jews in all matters of civil law. Since its rediscovery, his work has become the primary traditional source for modern Jewish universalism and interfaith relations.

#### 5. Rabbi David Altschuler (Metzudat David)

The commentary known as the *Metzudot* ("The Fortresses") is the product of an 18th-century father-son collaboration, initiated by Rabbi David Altschuler (c. 1687–1769) and completed by his son, Rabbi Yechiel Hillel Altschuler. Working in Galicia and Prague, they perceived that the study of Tanakh, particularly *Nevi'im* (Prophets) and *Ketuvim* (Writings), had "weakened." Their work, which covers only *Nevi'im* and *Ketuvim*, was a purely pedagogical intervention designed to reverse this decline.

The brilliance of the *Metzudot* lies not in its content, which is intentionally not original—it is a masterful compilation and simplification based primarily on Radak—but in its revolutionary *form*. Rabbi Yechiel Hillel split the commentary into two distinct parts, printed side-by-side on the page. The first, *Metzudat Tzion* ("Fortress of Zion"), is a simple glossary whose sole function is to define individual difficult Hebrew words. The second, *Metzudat David* ("Fortress of David"), is the commentary proper, providing a clear, flowing paraphrase and explanation of the verse's meaning as a whole. This two-part system created a "frictionless reading experience." It solved the problem of earlier commentaries, like Radak's, which required a student to get bogged down in a grammatical discussion just to understand the verse. With the *Metzudot*, a student can read the flowing paraphrase of *Metzudat David* and only glance at *Metzudat Tzion* if they encounter an unfamiliar word. This pedagogical innovation was a massive success, and the *Metzudot* became a standard, indispensable starting point for any student beginning the study of the Prophets and Writings.

#### 6. Rabbi Meir Leibush Wisser (Malbim)

Rabbi Meir Leibush Wisser (1809–1879), the Malbim, was a "warrior" rabbi, grammarian, and polemicist whose life was defined by his fierce, uncompromising struggle against the 19th-century Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment) and the nascent Reform movement. His stormy rabbinic career saw him expelled from Bucharest for his staunch opposition to any religious innovations. His commentary was his weapon in this war. His magnum opus, *HaTorah veHaMitzvah*, was an explicit polemic against the Reform movement's claim that the Oral Law (the Talmud) was a later, human invention separate from the "pure" Written Torah. The Malbim's goal was to prove, through systematic linguistic analysis, that the *entire* Oral Law is "implicit in the plain meaning of the verse."

To achieve this, he launched an exegetical counter-reformation built on two radical linguistic principles. First, he rejected the long-held rabbinic principle that "the Torah speaks in human language." He argued that in a divine text, there are *no true synonyms* and *no redundancies*. If the Torah uses two different words for "speak" (e.g., *amar* vs. *diber*), they must have distinct, precise meanings that carry *halachic* implications. Second, in his introduction *Ayelet ha-Shachar*, he laid out a "rediscovered" system of 613 precise grammatical and syntactic rules that he claimed the Talmudic Sages used to derive the Oral Law. With this framework, the Malbim argued that what earlier commentators (like Rashi or Ibn Ezra) saw as *derash* (homiletics) was, in fact, the true, logical, grammatical *peshat* of the verse. He effectively co-opted the Enlightenment's own tools—logic and systematic rules—to defend the divine, inseparable unity of the Written and Oral Law, becoming a hero of the modern Orthodox yeshiva world.

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use (Psalm 10)

This section summarizes how Psalm 10 and its phrases are used in contemporary Jewish liturgy.

### Phrase-Level Liturgical Usage

The following phrases from Psalm 10 appear in various liturgical contexts:

#### Phrase: יְהֹוָ֣ה מֶ֭לֶךְ עוֹלָ֣ם וָעֶ֑ד אָבְד֥וּ ג֝וֹיִ֗ם מֵאַרְצֽוֹ׃ (from 10:16)

Psalm 10:16, declaring God's eternal kingship, holds a stable and significant position within the *Pesukei Dezimra* (Verses of Praise) of the daily and festival Shacharit service according to the Sefardic and Mizrachi rites. This verse is not recited as part of its original psalm but is instead integrated into the liturgical mosaic known as *Yehi K'vod*, a curated collection of verses celebrating divine majesty and power. It is strategically placed immediately following the climactic threefold declaration of God's reign over past, present, and future. The liturgy flows directly from this acclamation into our verse, creating a powerful sequence: "יְהֹוָה מֶֽלֶךְ, יְהֹוָה מָלָךְ, יְהֹוָה יִמְלֹךְ לְעֹלָם וָעֶד: יְהֹוָה מֶֽלֶךְ עוֹלָם וָעֶד אָבְדוּ גוֹיִם מֵאַרְצוֹ: יְהֹוָה הֵפִיר עֲצַת־גּוֹיִם הֵנִיא מַחְשְׁבוֹת עַמִּים" ("The LORD is King, the LORD was King, the LORD will be King forever and ever; The LORD is King for ever and ever; nations have perished from His land; The LORD foils the counsel of nations"). This juxtaposition serves to contrast God's immutable sovereignty with the ultimate futility and transience of earthly powers. By affirming that the "nations have perished from His land," the verse reinforces the theme of God's ultimate triumph and exclusive dominion, a central motif of the morning praises.

---

#### Phrase: לְדֹ֥ר וָ֝דֹ֗ר אֲשֶׁ֣ר (from 10:6)

The phrase לְדֹר וָדֹר appears in liturgy exclusively through the recitation of Psalm 33, where it affirms the eternal nature of God's counsel. Its primary placement is within the expanded *Pesukei Dezimra* (Verses of Praise) for the Shacharit service on Shabbat, Festivals, and the High Holy Days across both Ashkenazic and Mizrachi rites. In this setting, the phrase is part of a larger theological statement contrasting divine permanence with human transience, as the liturgy proclaims: "עֲצַת יְהֹוָה לְעוֹלָם תַּעֲמֹד מַחְשְׁבוֹת לִבּוֹ לְדֹר וָדֹר: אַשְׁרֵי הַגּוֹי אֲשֶׁר־יְהֹוָה אֱלֹהָיו הָעָם בָּחַר לְנַֽחֲלָה לוֹ" (The counsel of the LORD stands forever, the thoughts of His heart to all generations. Fortunate is the nation whose God is the LORD). This recitation serves to establish a theme of God's ultimate sovereignty and providence at the outset of the morning prayer on these sacred days. A distinct but thematically similar usage is found in the Sefardic rite, where Psalm 33 is recited as part of the home ritual after the lighting of the Hanukkah candles, connecting the miracle of the festival to God's enduring plan.

---

#### Phrase: תָּכִ֥ין לִ֝בָּ֗ם תַּקְשִׁ֥יב (from 10:17)

The phrase תָּכִין לִבָּם תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ appears almost exclusively as a poignant plea within the High Holiday liturgy, specifically in liturgical poems (*piyyutim*) recited during the Chazan's Repetition of the Amidah. In both Ashkenazi and Edot HaMizrach traditions for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, the prayer leader, feeling unworthy to represent the congregation, uses this verse to shift the focus from his own merit to God's power to prepare the worshippers' hearts for prayer and to accept their supplications. For example, in the Ashkenazi Rosh Hashanah service, the chazan declares his role as an emissary before pleading, "לְחַלּוֹתְךָ שְׁלָחֽוּנִי מַקְהֲלוֹת הֲמוֹנֶֽךָ. תָּכִין לִבָּם תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶֽךָ" ("Your teeming congregations have sent me to entreat You. Prepare their heart; incline Your ear"). A distinct, non-liturgical usage is found in the *Iggeret HaRamban*, an ethical letter included in many prayer books, where the verse serves as a prooftext to teach that righteous living prepares one's heart, ensuring that one's prayers will be heard.

---

#### Phrase: תַּאֲוַ֬ת עֲנָוִ֣ים שָׁמַ֣עְתָּ יְהֹוָ֑ה תָּכִ֥ין לִ֝בָּ֗ם תַּקְשִׁ֥יב אׇזְנֶֽךָ׃ (from 10:17)

The verse תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים שָׁמַעְתָּ (the desire of the humble You have heard) finds its sole liturgical setting within the Sefardic rite for the *Hakafot* (circuits) on Simchat Torah. This recitation occurs during both the Ma'ariv and Shacharit services as part of the highly celebratory Torah service that marks the conclusion of the annual reading cycle. Specifically, the verse is included in a collection of biblical passages recited during the first of the seven circuits, which is kabbalistically associated with the divine attribute of *Malkhut* (Kingship). In this context, it serves as a prelude to a direct supplication, framing the community's joyous approach to God: ‎...וַאֲנִי כְּזַיִת רַעֲנָן בְּבֵית אֱלֹהִים, בָּטַחְתִּי בְּחֶסֶד אֱלֹהִים עוֹלָם וָעֶד. תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים שָׁמַעְתָּ יְהֹוָה, תָּכִין לִבָּם תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ: רִבּוֹנוֹ שֶׁל עוֹלָם... By invoking God’s attentiveness to the humble, the liturgy connects the peak of communal joy with an underlying posture of devotional humility, affirming that even in moments of great celebration, God hears the innermost desires of the heart.

---

#### Phrase: לָמָ֣ה יְ֭הֹוָה תַּעֲמֹ֣ד בְּרָח֑וֹק תַּ֝עְלִ֗ים לְעִתּ֥וֹת בַּצָּרָֽה׃ (from 10:1)

The plaintive cry of Psalm 10:1 is invoked in a specific and poignant liturgical setting: the Sefardic Selichot service for the fast day of the 20th of Sivan. This day commemorates historical tragedies, and the verse is not recited as part of a full psalm but is instead embedded within a catena of thematically linked biblical passages expressing communal distress and a plea for divine intervention. It appears in a collection of verses that question God’s apparent absence, creating a powerful moment of lament. The liturgy strings together these petitions: "כִּי אַתָּה אֲדֹנָי טוֹב וְסַלָּח וְרַב חֶסֶד לְכָל קֹרְאֶיךָ: לָמָה יְהֹוָה תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָחוֹק תַּעְלִים לְעִתּוֹת בַּצָּרָה: לָמָּה פָנֶיךָ תַסְתִּיר תִּשְׁכַּח עָנְיֵנוּ וְלַחֲצֵנוּ." By placing this verse after an affirmation of God's goodness (Ps. 86:5) and before another question of divine hiddenness (Ps. 44:25), the liturgy heightens the emotional tension. This strategic compilation of verses gives voice to the community's anguish and its yearning for God to cease standing "aloof" in times of trouble.

---

#### Phrase: לָמָ֣ה יְ֭הֹוָה תַּעֲמֹ֣ד בְּרָח֑וֹק (from 10:1)

The poignant question from Psalm 10:1, לָמָ֣ה יְ֭הֹוָה תַּעֲמֹ֣ד בְּרָח֑וֹק, finds a singular and dramatic liturgical home within the Edot HaMizrach rite for Yom Kippur. It appears during the Neilah service, the final and most climactic prayer of the day, as part of the extensive block of Slichot and concluding litanies recited after the repetition of the Amidah. The phrase is not part of a full psalm recitation but is powerfully integrated into a piyyut that voices the community's distress and desperation. The poem builds to a crescendo of entreaty, pleading: "עֲמֹד בַּפֶּֽרֶץ בַּל נִהְיֶה לִשְׂחֹק. לָמָה יְהֹוָה תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָחוֹק" ("Stand in the breach lest we become a laughingstock; Why, O LORD, do you stand far off?"). This placement transforms the psalmist's ancient cry into an urgent, communal plea, expressing profound vulnerability at the very moment the gates of repentance are believed to be closing.

---

#### Phrase: תָּכִ֥ין לִ֝בָּ֗ם (from 10:17)

The phrase תָּכִ֥ין לִ֝בָּ֗ם (You will prepare their heart), from Psalm 10:17, appears liturgically within the Edot HaMizrach tradition during the solemn Selichot service for the Mincha prayer of Yom Kippur. It is not a recitation of the psalm itself, but rather a skillful integration of the biblical text into the fabric of a *piyyut* (liturgical poem). Specifically, the phrase is found in the penitential poem 'Yah Shma Evyonekha' (God, Hear Your Needy Ones), which petitions for forgiveness and acceptance. The stanza containing the phrase reads, "וּמְחֵה הַיּוֹם חוֹבָם, וּרְצֵה כְּמוֹ שַׁי נִיבָם, וּלְךָ תָּכִין לִבָּם, וְגַם תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶֽךָ" ("And erase their debt today, and accept their utterance like an offering, and for You, prepare their heart, and also cause Your ear to hear"). By adding the word "וּלְךָ" (for You), the paytan transforms the descriptive biblical statement into a direct plea, asking God to prepare the worshippers' hearts for Him and to be receptive to their prayers. This creative re-contextualization deepens the poem's theme of supplication at the climax of the Day of Atonement.

---

#### Phrase: שְׁ֭בֹר זְר֣וֹעַ רָשָׁ֑ע (from 10:15)

The phrase שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רָשָׁע (Break the arm of the wicked) appears in a singular but significant liturgical context within the Ashkenazi tradition. It is found during the Mussaf service of Yom Kippur as part of the Seder HaAvodah, the elaborate poetic recounting of the High Priest's service in the Temple. Following the detailed narrative of the sacred rites, the liturgy transitions into a series of supplicatory poems that lament the current state of exile and pray for redemption. Within one of these alphabetical acrostic piyyutim, the phrase is invoked as a powerful plea for divine justice, stating: "רֽוּמָה עֻזֶּֽךָ וְרוֹמֵם שְׁפָלִים: שְׁבֹר זְרֽוֹעַ רֶֽשַׁע. תִּמְלֹךְ לְבַדְּךָ בְּקוֹרְאֵי שְׁמֶֽךָ" ("Raise Your might and elevate the lowly; break the arm of the wicked; You alone will reign over those who call Your name"). In this setting, the verse from Psalms is not merely a historical quote but an active petition, transforming the memory of past glory into an urgent appeal for God to shatter the power of evil and re-establish His sovereignty in the present.

## Related Psalms Analysis

The librarian has found that the psalm you're analyzing (Psalm 10) has some POSSIBLY interesting word and phrase relationships with other psalms (Psalms 31, 94, 7, 74, 44).

To understand the potential value of these connections, consider the scholarly consensus regarding Psalm 25 and Psalm 34. These two acrostics are a classic example of a "diptych," or deliberate pair, linked by numerous structural and thematic echoes.
- **Structural Anomaly**: They both share the unique acrostic structure of omitting the Vav (ו) stanza and adding a final Pe (פ) stanza, which links them conceptually through the root פדה (padah - to redeem).
- **The "Call and Response" Arc**: This structural link is reinforced by a clear theological arc:
  - **The Plea (Ps 25:22)**: Concludes with the petition פְּדֵה... מִכֹּל צָרוֹתָיו (pedeh... mikol tzarotav - "Redeem... from all his troubles").
  - **The Response (Ps 34:7, 18)**: Answers with the assurance וּמִכׇּל־צָרוֹתָיו הוֹשִׁיעוֹ (u'mikol-tzarotav hoshio - "and from all his troubles He saved him") and the final capstone statement פֹּדֶה יְהֹוָה (podeh Adonai - "The Lord redeems").
- **Shared Wisdom Theme**: Both psalms pivot to wisdom instruction using the nearly identical rhetorical question מִי־הָאִישׁ (mi ha-ish - "Who is the man...") (Ps 25:12, Ps 34:13).
- **Shared Thematic Vocabulary**: They are further bound by a specific vocabulary of piety and instruction, including:
  - "Fear of the LORD" (Ps 25:12, 14; Ps 34:8, 10, 12)
  - "The humble/afflicted" (עֲנָוִים - anavim) (Ps 25:9; Ps 34:3)
  - "Good" (טוֹב - tov) (Ps 25:13; Ps 34:9, 11, 13)

### MACRO THESIS (original structural analysis)
**Thesis**: Psalm 10 confronts the theological crisis of divine hiddenness by juxtaposing the wicked's ideology of practical atheism ('God does not see') against the lived reality of God's attentive kingship. Through an extended portrait of the oppressor's interior life—unprecedented in its psychological depth—the psalm exposes how violence against the vulnerable is rooted not merely in action but in theological distortion. The movement from complaint (v. 1) through sustained description (vv. 2-11) to confident petition (vv. 12-18) enacts a rhetorical theodicy: the very act of prayer contradicts the wicked's claim that God is absent, asserting that divine vision penetrates both human cruelty and human suffering.
**Genre**: Individual Lament with Wisdom Elements

**Structure**:
  - v. 1: Opening Lament: Divine Absence
  - vv. 2-3: Introduction of the Wicked and His Victims
  - vv. 4-7: The Wicked's Theology: Practical Atheism
  - vv. 8-10: Predator Imagery: The Wicked as Hunter
  - v. 11: Climax of Wicked's Theology
  - vv. 12-13: Petition: Call for Divine Action
  - v. 14: Theological Reversal: Divine Vision Affirmed
  - vv. 15-16: Petition for Justice and Declaration of Kingship
  - vv. 17-18: Confidence: God Hears the Lowly

**Poetic Devices**:
  - Interior Monologue (Quoted Speech): Three-fold quotation of what the wicked 'says in his heart' (amar be-libbo), revealing his interior theology and false security
  - Sustained Metaphor (Predator/Hunter): Extended comparison of the wicked to a predatory animal (lion in lair) hunting vulnerable prey, with vocabulary of lurking, ambush, coverts, and nets
  - Rhetorical Questions (Interrogative Parallelism): Two 'Why?' questions frame the psalm's movement: Why does God stand aloof? (v. 1) and Why should the wicked scorn God? (v. 13)
  - Emphatic Reversal/Contradictio: V. 14's 'You DO look!' (ra'itah) directly contradicts v. 11's claim that God 'never looks' and v. 1's complaint that God 'hides'
  - Anaphora and Repetition: Repetition of 'rasha' (wicked) as subject throughout; parallel constructions in petition section (imperatives); repeated references to the poor with varying terms ('ani, chelekah, yatom)
  - Body Part Imagery (Somatic Metaphor): Progressive anatomical references: mouth (v. 7), tongue (v. 7), eyes (v. 8), arm (v. 15), ears (v. 17), heart (vv. 6, 11, 13, 17)
  - Contrastive Parallelism (Antithetical Structure): Systematic contrast between the wicked's perspective/actions and God's perspective/actions, between oppressor and oppressed, between false confidence and true refuge
  - Verbal Wordplay (Paronomasia): Wordplay on 'darash' (seek/call to account): the wicked thinks God doesn't darash (v. 4, 13), but God will darash his wickedness until none is found (v. 15)
  - Kingship Declaration (Hymnic Intrusion): Sudden shift to credal declaration in v. 16: 'YHWH is king forever and ever'—changes register from petition to praise
  - Inclusio (Frame): Thematic bookending: v. 1's 'times of trouble' and God's distance answered by v. 18's assurance that earthly tyrants will terrorize 'no more'; the orphan/lowly mentioned early (v. 2) and late (vv. 17-18)

**Research Questions** (from Macro Analyst):
  1. What is the significance of Psalm 10's connection to Psalm 9 as part of a broken acrostic, and how does this structural feature relate to the theme of broken/hidden divine order?
  2. How does the three-fold 'says in his heart' formula (vv. 6, 11, 13) function in wisdom literature, and what does it reveal about the relationship between ideology and action?
  3. What is the semantic range and usage of 'ani (poor/afflicted/lowly) in the Psalter, and how does Psalm 10's usage compare to prophetic social justice texts?
  4. How does the predator/lion imagery in vv. 8-10 compare to other Ancient Near Eastern royal or military metaphors, and is there ironic reversal (the powerful acting like beasts)?
  5. What is the theological significance of the verb ra'ah (see/look) in vv. 1, 11, 14—how does divine vision function in theodicy?
  6. What does 'breaking the arm' (v. 15) signify in biblical political theology, and are there other texts where this metaphor appears?
  7. How does the orphan (yatom) motif in vv. 14, 18 connect to Torah legislation (e.g., Exodus 22:22, Deuteronomy 10:18) and covenant identity?
  8. What is the function of the nations ('goyim) in v. 16, and how does this relate to the psalm's concern with oppression—are the wicked identified with foreign powers or internal elites?
  9. How does the phrase 'men of the earth' ('enosh min-ha'aretz) in v. 18 emphasize human mortality and temporal power versus divine eternality?
  10. What is the rhetorical force of the shift from imperfect (future/modal) verbs in the petition section to perfect verbs in vv. 17-18, suggesting accomplished reality?
  11. How does this psalm's theodicy—resolving divine hiddenness through assertion of divine kingship—compare to Job's treatment of the same problem?
  12. What is the relationship between the wicked's 'prospering ways' (v. 5) and the concept of retributive justice elsewhere in Psalms—is there tension or development?

### MICRO DISCOVERIES (verse-level observations)
**Verse 1**
Opening with two parallel 'why' questions (לָמָה) creates rhetorical force. The verbs 'stand aloof' (תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָחוֹק) and 'hide' (תַּעְלִים) are striking spatial metaphors for divine absence. The phrase לְעִתּוֹת בַּצָּרָֽה ('in times of trouble') is temporally specific - not general absence but contextual hiddenness.

**Verse 2**
The verse opens with בְּגַאֲוַת רָשָׁע ('in the arrogance of the wicked') - arrogance as causal force. Verb יִדְלַק ('burns after/pursues hotly') is vivid - suggesting passionate hunting. Second half shifts to passive/jussive יִתָּפְשׂוּ ('may they be caught') - a curse interrupting description. The phrase בִּמְזִמּוֹת זוּ חָשָֽׁבוּ ('schemes which they devised') emphasizes premeditation.

**Verse 3**
Triple characterization of the wicked: he 'boasts' (הִלֵּל), he is 'grasping' (בֹּצֵעַ), he 'reviles/scorns' (נִאֵץ). The phrase עַל־תַּאֲוַת נַפְשׁוֹ ('about his soul's desire') reveals interior motivation. The verb נִאֵץ with direct object יְהוָה is shocking - explicit theological rebellion. The grasping one בֵּרֵךְ ('blesses') - possibly sarcastic or means 'congratulates himself'?

**Verse 4**
Syntax is challenging: כְּגֹבַהּ אַפּוֹ ('according to the height of his nose/anger') - physical arrogance imagery. The phrase בַּל־יִדְרֹשׁ ('he does not seek') introduces key verb דרשׁ. Then אֵין אֱלֹהִים כׇּל־מְזִמּוֹתָֽיו - puzzling syntax, could mean 'God is not in all his thoughts' or 'there is no God [in/among] all his schemes.' This is the wicked's practical atheism.

**Verse 5**
Verse describes apparent success: דְרָכָו יָחִילוּ ('his ways prosper/are firm') - verb חיל suggesting strength/success. Then מָרוֹם מִשְׁפָּטֶיךָ מִנֶּגְדּוֹ ('Your judgments are high/far from before him') - spatial theology again. Final image: כׇּל־צוֹרְרָיו יָפִיחַ בָּהֶֽם ('all his foes he snorts/puffs at') - animalistic contempt.

[... and 13 more verses]

**Interesting Questions** (from Micro Analyst):
  1. Why does the phrase אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ ('says in his heart') appear exactly three times (vv.6,11,13), and what is the rhetorical progression across these interior quotations?
  2. What is the syntactical relationship in v.4 between 'bal yidrosh' and 'ein elohim kol-mezimmotav' - is the latter a quotation, a description, or syntactically linked to the former?
  3. How does the mixed predator imagery (lion in v.9 + net in v.9) function - are these compatible metaphors or deliberately jarring juxtapositions?
  4. Why does v.16's kingship declaration use prophetic perfect אָבְדוּ ('nations have perished') - does this assert accomplished fact or prophetic certainty?
  5. What is the significance of the five different terms for victims (ani, chelekah, naqi, yatom, dak) - do they represent distinct social categories or poetic variation?
  6. How does the spatial theology (God stands afar v.1, judgments are high v.5, but God 'looks' v.14) resolve the theodicy problem?
  7. What does the phrase אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָֽרֶץ ('man from/of the earth') in v.18 contribute theologically - is this about mortality, earthly power, or human limitation?
  8. Why does the verb דרש appear in three strategic locations (vv.4,13,15) with different subjects and objects - what is the wordplay's function?
  9. How does the emphatic fronted verb רָאִתָה in v.14 function grammatically and rhetorically - is this standard Hebrew emphasis or unusual?
  10. What is the relationship between the 'mouth full' imagery (v.7) and the 'says in heart' quotations (vv.6,11,13) - interior vs exterior speech?
  11. Why does v.10 have Kethiv/Qere variants, and how do these affect the interpretation of who is crushed/crouching?
  12. How does the phrase 'breaking the arm' (v.15) function as political metaphor elsewhere in biblical literature - military, juridical, or symbolic disarmament?
  13. What is the significance of the sudden genre shift to hymnic declaration in v.16 - does this interrupt the petition or resolve it?
  14. Why does the psalmist use both YHWH and El in v.12 - is this poetic variation, theological emphasis, or liturgical formula?
  15. How does the orphan motif (vv.14,18) connect to Torah legislation about widow/orphan, and does this invoke covenant obligations?

### ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK (for reference on poetic conventions)
Concepts and Analytical Frameworks for Biblical Poetry: A Foundational Document for the Telescopic Analysis of the PsalmsPreamble: Purpose and Methodological StanceThis document serves as the core knowledge base for an AI-powered commentary pipeline, designed to facilitate a literary-poetic analysis of the Book of Psalms. Its structure is optimized for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to provide precise, context-rich information on the artistic conventions of biblical Hebrew poetry. The methodological stance is inspired by the literary approach of scholars like Robert Alter, which treats the biblical text as a work of sophisticated literary art.1 This framework posits that poetic form is not a decorative embellishment but the primary vehicle of meaning and theological expression.3 The objective is to equip analytical agents to move beyond surface-level paraphrase to a "telescopic analysis"—a method that connects micro-level poetic devices (e.g., a single word choice, a metaphor) to the macro-level thematic and theological arguments of an entire psalm.I. The Foundational Principle: ParallelismParallelism is the most fundamental and pervasive organizing principle of biblical Hebrew poetry.5 An analysis of its dynamic nature is the prerequisite for any meaningful literary interpretation. It is a "seconding sequence" where the relationship between the parts of a line, rather than rhyme or a strict meter, creates the poetic effect.6The Dynamics of Parallelism: Defining the "A is so, and what's more, B" PrincipleThe core dynamic of parallelism is not simple repetition but a progression of thought, aptly summarized by the principle "A is so, and what's more, B." In this model, the second part of a poetic line, or colon, dynamically engages with the first. It can confirm, sharpen, specify, intensify, contrast, or complete the initial statement.4 This functional understanding represents a significant development from earlier, more static classificatory approaches, which identified types of parallelism but often under-analyzed their rhetorical purpose.2 The energy of a poetic line sweeps from the first colon to the second, creating a forward momentum that can develop an argument or unfold "miniature stories".4 This principle forces the reader—or an AI agent—to locate the primary locus of meaning in the relationship between the cola, treating them not as isolated statements but as an integrated, developing thought.10 It is the essential "rhyme of thought" that defines Hebrew verse.11Synonymous ParallelismConcept Name: Synonymous ParallelismDefinition: A form of parallelism where the second colon restates, echoes, or reinforces the thought of the first colon using different but semantically equivalent words or concepts.5Function in Poetry: The function of synonymous parallelism is rarely simple tautology. It serves to reinforce and amplify an idea, adding emotional depth and aesthetic beauty that makes the message more memorable and impactful.12 Frequently, the second colon achieves this by intensifying the first or by moving from a general term to a more specific or concrete image, making the concept more pointed and forceful.7 This progression from general to particular is a key dynamic of biblical poetry.Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 19:1: "הַשָּׁמַיִם מְסַפְּרִים כְּבוֹד-אֵל // וּמַעֲשֵׂה יָדָיו מַגִּיד הָרָקִיעַ."6Psalm 24:1: "לַיהוָה הָאָרֶץ וּמְלוֹאָהּ // תֵּבֵל וְיֹשְׁבֵי בָהּ."13Psalm 120:2: "יְהוָה הַצִּילָה נַפְשִׁי מִשְּׂפַת-שֶׁקֶר // מִלָּשׁוֹן רְמִיָּה."12Analytical Questions:How does the second colon restate the first? Does it use direct synonyms or related concepts?Does the second colon specify, intensify, or make the first more concrete? If so, what is the effect of this shift?What nuances of meaning are introduced by the specific word choices in the second colon that are not present in the first?Does the second line simply repeat the first, or does it heighten the idea or emotion?Antithetic ParallelismConcept Name: Antithetic ParallelismDefinition: A form of parallelism where the second colon presents a thought that is in direct contrast or opposition to the first.5 The contrast is often, but not always, marked by a conjunction such as "but".11Function in Poetry: This device sharpens an idea by defining it against its opposite. The use of opposites clarifies both extremes, creating a starker focus on the desired message and forcing a moral or theological choice.16 It is a favored device in wisdom literature for framing the two paths of life—for example, righteousness versus wickedness, or wisdom versus folly—thereby creating tension and emphasizing the consequences of a decision.5Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 1:6: "כִּי-יוֹדֵעַ יְהוָה דֶּרֶךְ צַדִּיקִים // וְדֶרֶךְ רְשָׁעִים תֹּאבֵד."11Psalm 20:7: "אֵלֶּה בָרֶכֶב וְאֵלֶּה בַסּוּסִים // וַאֲנַחְנוּ בְּשֵׁם-יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ נַזְכִּיר."20Psalm 34:10: "כְּפִירִים רָשׁוּ וְרָעֵבוּ // וְדֹרְשֵׁי יְהוָה לֹא-יַחְסְרוּ כָל-טוֹב."16Analytical Questions:What two concepts, paths, or outcomes are being contrasted in this verse?How does the contrast in the second colon clarify or sharpen the meaning of the first?What is the central idea that is being defined by this opposition?Is the contrast marked by a conjunction like "but," or is it implied by the juxtaposition of the two lines?Synthetic (or Climactic/Staircase) ParallelismConcept Name: Synthetic (or Climactic/Staircase) ParallelismDefinition: A form of parallelism where the second colon does not restate or contrast the first but instead builds upon, extends, or completes its thought.5 The climactic or "staircase" variation is a specific type where a key word or phrase from the first colon is repeated in the second, which then adds new information to build toward a climax or completion.8Function in Poetry: This form creates narrative or logical progression within the poetic line itself, developing an argument, explaining a cause and effect, or building emotional intensity step-by-step.23 It is the most explicit embodiment of the "A is so, and what's more, B" principle, as the second line carries the thought of the first to its conclusion.Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 29:1-2: "הָבוּ לַיהוָה בְּנֵי אֵלִים // הָבוּ לַיהוָה כָּבוֹד וָעֹז. // הָבוּ לַיהוָה כְּבוֹד שְׁמוֹ..."23Psalm 14:2: "יְהוָה מִשָּׁמַיִם הִשְׁקִיף עַל-בְּנֵי-אָדָם // לִרְאוֹת הֲיֵשׁ מַשְׂכִּיל דֹּרֵשׁ אֶת-אֱלֹהִים."22Psalm 96:1-2: "שִׁירוּ לַיהוָה שִׁיר חָדָשׁ // שִׁירוּ לַיהוָה כָּל-הָאָרֶץ. // שִׁירוּ לַיהוָה בָּרְכוּ שְׁמוֹ..."20Analytical Questions:How does the second colon build upon or complete the thought of the first?Is there a cause-and-effect relationship, a question-and-answer, or a sequential development being presented?In climactic forms, what key term is repeated, and what new information is added to create a sense of rising intensity or completion?How does this progression contribute to the overall argument of the psalm?II. Poetic Diction: Economy and ConcretenessThe characteristic style of Hebrew poetry favors compact expression and tangible imagery, creating a discourse that is both dense and emotionally resonant.Terseness & ConcisenessConcept Name: Terseness & ConcisenessDefinition: A primary characteristic of biblical Hebrew poetry is its compressed and economical use of language, employing a minimum of words to express complex ideas.2 This is often achieved through the omission of common prose particles (such as the definite article or direct object marker) and conjunctions, and through the use of ellipsis, where a word from the first colon (frequently the verb) is omitted but understood in the second.6Function in Poetry: Terseness creates a heightened, dense form of discourse that focuses attention on the most semantically important words.2 By omitting explicit logical connectors, the poet forces the reader to deduce the relationship between cola from the parallel structure itself, thereby empowering the function of parallelism. This word economy also contributes to the accentual rhythm of the verse by keeping lines short and impactful.2 Imagery, in this context, becomes a primary tool for compactness, allowing the poet to communicate a rich message in very few words.14Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 114:4: "הֶהָרִים רָקְדוּ כְאֵילִים // גְּבָעוֹת כִּבְנֵי-צֹאן."25Psalm 23:1: "יְהוָה רֹעִי // לֹא אֶחְסָר."Psalm 1:3: "וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל-פַּלְגֵי מָיִם // אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיוֹ יִתֵּן בְּעִתּוֹ."Analytical Questions:Are there words (especially verbs or conjunctions) from the first colon that are omitted but implied in the second? What is the effect of this ellipsis?How does the economy of words force a greater focus on the key nouns and verbs that are present?Does the terseness create ambiguity, or does it sharpen the focus and impact of the verse?How does the poet use a single image to convey a complex idea concisely?Concrete ImageryConcept Name: Concrete ImageryDefinition: Hebrew poetry demonstrates a marked preference for conveying theological ideas, emotional states, and moral principles through concrete, physical, and sensory images rather than through abstract philosophical or theological language.29 The ancient Hebrew imagination engaged the world not through abstract categories but through the empirical knowledge of lived experience—the life of shepherds, warriors, farmers, and priests.3Function in Poetry: Concrete images make abstract concepts tangible, emotionally resonant, and memorable.15 They ground theological claims in the physical world, allowing the poet to explore complex spiritual states through a shared, sensory vocabulary. Transforming a general term into a concrete image makes the idea "more pointed, more forceful".9 This imagery is not merely ornamental but functional, expressing significant themes and conveying implicit value judgments.30 For example, the choice between pastoral, military, or cultic imagery frames the psalmist's problem and the desired divine response.Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 18:2: "יְהוָה סַלְעִי וּמְצוּדָתִי וּמְפַלְטִי // אֵלִי צוּרִי אֶחֱסֶה-בּוֹ // מָגִנִּי וְקֶרֶן-יִשְׁעִי מִשְׂגַּבִּי."25Psalm 23:1-3: "יְהוָה רֹעִי... בִּנְאוֹת דֶּשֶׁא יַרְבִּיצֵנִי עַל-מֵי מְנֻחוֹת יְנַהֲלֵנִי..."33Psalm 1:3: "וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל-פַּלְgֵי מָיִם..."34Analytical Questions:What concrete, physical image is being used in this verse? What senses does it appeal to (sight, sound, touch)?What abstract theological, emotional, or moral concept does this image represent?What specific attributes of the concrete image are being mapped onto the abstract concept (e.g., a rock's stability, a shield's protection, a tree's fruitfulness)?How does the domain of the imagery (e.g., nature, warfare, temple cult) contribute to the overall argument or emotional tone of the psalm?III. The Music of Language: Sound and WordplayThese devices leverage the phonetic qualities of the Hebrew language to create artistic effects that enhance meaning and memorability. While often lost in translation, an awareness of their function is crucial for appreciating the original artistry.ParonomasiaConcept Name: ParonomasiaDefinition: The use of words that are similar in sound but different in meaning to create a "wordplay" or "pun".35 It is a deliberate juxtaposition of like-sounding words that draws the reader's attention to a particular statement or connection.37Function in Poetry: Paronomasia forges an associative link between two otherwise disparate concepts, prompting the reader to consider their relationship. It adds a layer of wit, memorability, and rhetorical force, often underscoring a solemn or important statement that might otherwise be overlooked.35Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 56:8: "נֹדִי סָפַרְתָּה-אָתָּה // שִׂימָה דִמְעָתִי בְנֹאדֶךָ." The similar sounds of the Hebrew words for "my wanderings" ($nōdî$) and "in your bottle" ($bənōdekā$) phonetically link the cause (wandering) with the effect (tears) that God is said to collect and remember.35Psalm 96:5: "כִּי כָּל-אֱלֹהֵי הָעַמִּים אֱלִילִים // וַיהוָה שָׁמַיִם עָשָׂה." This is a common prophetic wordplay contrasting the true God ($'elohim$) with "worthless things" ($'elilim$).Analytical Questions:(For Hebrew text analysis) Are there words in close proximity that share similar root consonants or sounds but have different meanings?What new connection or idea is suggested by the phonetic link between these words?How does this wordplay contribute to the verse's rhetorical force, memorability, or theological argument?Alliteration & AssonanceConcept Name: Alliteration & AssonanceDefinition: Alliteration is the repetition of the same or similar consonant sounds in nearby words, typically at the beginning of words. Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds within nearby words.38 While not a primary structural principle in Hebrew poetry, these sound devices are common and are used for aesthetic and emphatic effect.25Function in Poetry: These devices enhance the musicality and oral-aural quality of the poetry, making it more pleasing to the ear and more memorable.38 They can be used to link key words together, create emphasis on a particular phrase, and contribute to the emotional texture of a line. The sound itself can be mimetic, with the phonetic quality reinforcing the semantic meaning (e.g., harsh sounds for judgment, soft sounds for lament).41Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 29:1: In the Hebrew phrase kavod vā'oz (כָּבוֹד וָעֹז), the repetition of the 'o' vowel sound is an example of assonance.42Psalm 122:6: Sha'alu shalom Yerushalayim (שַׁאֲלוּ שְׁלוֹם יְרוּשָׁלָ‍ִם) features prominent alliteration of the 'sh' ($š$) and 'l' sounds.Psalm 6:6 (Hebrew 6:7): 'aśḥeh bəkol-laylāh miṭṭātî (אַשְׂחֶה בְכָל-לַיְלָה מִטָּתִי). The line is rich with sibilant 's' ($s/ś$) sounds, phonetically mimicking the sound of weeping or sighing.Analytical Questions:(For Hebrew text analysis) Is there a noticeable repetition of a particular consonant or vowel sound in this line or verse?Which words are linked by this sound repetition, and what is the significance of that link?How does the sound itself (e.g., a harsh guttural vs. a soft sibilant) contribute to the mood or meaning of the line?IV. Figurative Language: The Architecture of MeaningThis section covers devices that convey meaning by describing one thing in terms of another, creating rich layers of significance and enabling the poet to articulate complex truths.Metaphor & SimileConcept Name: Metaphor & SimileDefinition: Both are figures of speech that draw a comparison between two essentially different things to highlight a point of similarity. A simile makes the comparison explicit by using a comparative term such as "like" or "as." A metaphor makes the comparison implicitly, often by stating that A is B.34 While formally distinct, their poetic function is largely the same: to generate new understanding through analogy.44Function in Poetry: Metaphor and simile are central to poetic expression, transforming abstract concepts into concrete, understandable, and memorable images.34 They function by inviting the reader to transfer attributes from a familiar source domain (e.g., a shepherd) to a less familiar target domain (e.g., God) to generate new insight.44 They are the primary linguistic tools for expressing the ineffable nature of God and the depth of human spiritual experience, which defy literal description.15Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Simile: Psalm 1:3: "וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל-פַּלְגֵי מָיִם..."25Simile: Psalm 42:1: "כְּאַיָּל תַּעֲרֹג עַל-אֲפִיקֵי-מָיִם כֵּן נַפְשִׁי תַעֲרֹג אֵלֶיךָ אֱלֹהִים."11Metaphor: Psalm 23:1: "יְהוָה רֹעִי."15Metaphor: Psalm 84:11: "כִּי שֶׁמֶשׁ וּמָגֵן יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים."11Analytical Questions:What two things are being compared? Identify the target (the main subject) and the source (what it's being compared to).What specific characteristics of the source domain are being transferred to the target domain?How does this comparison help to understand the target (e.g., God, the psalmist's soul) in a new or deeper way?Is this a standalone figure of speech, or is it part of an extended metaphor that develops across several verses?MerismConcept Name: MerismDefinition: A figure of speech in which a totality or whole is expressed by naming two opposite, contrasting, or complementary parts.46Function in Poetry: Merism is a poetic and compact rhetorical device for expressing completeness or all-encompassing scope ("everything"). By naming the boundaries or polar extremes of a category (e.g., "day and night," "heaven and earth"), it implies everything contained within them, creating a sense of totality and amplification.46Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 139:2: "אַתָּה יָדַעְתָּ שִׁבְתִּי וְקוּמִי..."Psalm 121:6: "יוֹמָם הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ לֹא-יַכֶּכָּה וְיָרֵחַ בַּלָּיְלָה."46Psalm 121:8: "יְהוָה יִשְׁמָר-צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ..."46Analytical Questions:What are the two opposite or complementary poles mentioned in the text?What is the whole or totality that these two extremes are meant to represent?How does using a merism create a sense of all-encompassing scope for the action or attribute being described?PersonificationConcept Name: PersonificationDefinition: The attribution of human qualities, actions, emotions, or consciousness to inanimate objects, animals, or abstract concepts.11Function in Poetry: Personification enlivens the poetic world, creating a dramatic and vivid landscape where all of creation can participate in the relationship with God. It is a powerful tool for reinforcing themes of God's universal sovereignty by depicting nature as an active participant in praise or judgment.50 It can also make abstract concepts like "justice," "peace," or "steadfast love" into active agents within a poetic narrative.50Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 98:8: "נְהָרוֹת יִמְחֲאוּ-כָף, יַחַד הָרִים יְרַנֵּנוּ."50Psalm 19:1-2: "הַשָּׁמַיִם מְסַפְּרִים כְּבוֹד-אֵל... יוֹם לְיוֹם יַבִּיעַ אֹמֶר..."50Psalm 85:10: "חֶסֶד-וֶאֱמֶת נִפְגָּשׁוּ; צֶדֶק וְשָׁלוֹם נָשָׁקוּ."50Analytical Questions:What non-human entity is being given human attributes or actions?What specific human quality (e.g., speech, emotion, action) is being attributed to it?What is the poetic or theological effect of this personification? Does it make creation seem more alive, an abstract concept more active, or God's power more pervasive?V. Macro-Structures: Poetic Form and FramingThese devices organize larger blocks of text—from a few lines to an entire psalm—creating patterns that guide the reader, build emphasis, and unify the composition.Chiasmus (Chiastic Structure)Concept Name: Chiasmus (Chiastic Structure)Definition: An inverted literary structure in which a sequence of elements (words, phrases, or themes) is presented and then repeated in reverse order, creating a mirrored pattern such as A-B-B'-A' or A-B-C-B'-A'.51 The name is derived from the Greek letter Chi ($X$), which the pattern resembles when diagrammed, as lines can be drawn connecting the parallel elements.53Function in Poetry: Chiasmus is a sophisticated device used for emphasis, memorization, and to highlight the central element of the structure (the pivot or turning point), which often contains the main idea of the passage.53 By forcing the reader to process the logic of the poem both forwards and backwards, it underscores the unity of the composition and directs attention to its theological or emotional core.53Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Micro-Chiasm: Psalm 2:10: "וְעַתָּה מְלָכִים (A), הַשְׂכִּילוּ (B); // הִוָּסְרוּ (B'), שֹׁפְטֵי אָרֶץ (A')".53Macro-Chiasm: Psalm 8 is structured as a large-scale chiasm. It is framed by praise of God's name (A, v. 1 and A', v. 9), which envelops reflections on God's glory in the heavens (B, vv. 1-3) and humanity's rule on earth (B', vv. 6-8), with the central question about humanity's significance (C, vv. 4-5) at its core.53Thematic Chiasm: Psalm 106 embeds its historical narrative within a chiastic structure of key themes and repeated words, drawing attention to central motifs like Moses's intercession and the sin at Baal-Peor.55Analytical Questions:Are there repeated words, phrases, or ideas that appear in a mirrored or inverted order (A-B...B'-A')?What is the central element of the chiasm? How is it emphasized by the surrounding structure?How do the corresponding pairs (A and A', B and B') relate to each other? Does the second element resolve, expand upon, or reflect on the first?Inclusio (Envelope Structure)Concept Name: Inclusio (Envelope Structure)Definition: A literary device where a section of text is "bracketed" or "enveloped" by repeating the same or a very similar word, phrase, or theme at both the beginning and the end.56Function in Poetry: Inclusio serves to unify a poetic unit, clearly marking its beginning and end for the reader or listener.57 It highlights the central theme encapsulated within the "envelope" and encourages the interpretation of the intervening material in light of the framing statement.56 The meaning of the repeated phrase is often enriched or deepened by the content it encloses, so its final appearance carries more weight than its first.59Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalm 8: Begins and ends with the identical line: "יְהוָה אֲדֹנֵינוּ מָה-אַדִּיר שִׁמְךָ בְּכָל-הָאָרֶץ!" (vv. 1, 9).57Psalm 103: Begins and ends with the exhortation "בָּרְכִי נַפְשִׁי אֶת-יְהוָה" (vv. 1, 22), framing a lengthy recitation of God's benefits and merciful character.58Psalm 118: Begins and ends with the liturgical call to worship: "הוֹדוּ לַיהוָה כִּי-טוֹב כִּי לְעוֹלָם חַסְדּוֹ" (vv. 1, 29).56Analytical Questions:Does the same or a similar line, phrase, or key theme appear at both the beginning and the end of this psalm or stanza?What is the main idea of the material contained within this "envelope"?How does the repetition of the framing device guide the interpretation of the central content?Is the meaning of the closing phrase identical to the opening one, or has it been deepened by the intervening text?RefrainConcept Name: RefrainDefinition: A line, part of a line, or a group of lines repeated at regular or strategic intervals within a poem, functioning similarly to a chorus in a modern song.54Function in Poetry: A refrain serves as a primary structural marker, dividing a psalm into distinct stanzas or sections.63 Thematically, it often encapsulates the central plea, affirmation of trust, or core theme of the psalm, reinforcing it through repetition and providing an anchor point for the reader's attention and emotion.65Canonical Examples (from Psalms):Psalms 42-43: The refrain "מַה-תִּשְׁתּוֹחֲחִי נַפְשִׁי וַתֶּהֱמִי עָלָי הוֹחִילִי לֵאלֹהִים כִּי-עוֹד אוֹדֶנּוּ יְשׁוּעֹת פָּנַי וֵאלֹהָי" appears three times (42:5, 42:11; 43:5), structuring the poem and tracing the psalmist's internal struggle and self-exhortation.62Psalm 46: The refrain "יְהוָה צְבָאוֹת עִמָּנוּ מִשְׂגָּב-לָנוּ אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב סֶלָה" appears after the second and third stanzas (vv. 7, 11), acting as a powerful, climactic affirmation of trust.62Psalm 136: The refrain "כִּי לְעוֹלָם חַסְדּוֹ" is repeated after every single colon, making it the dominant structural and theological statement of the entire psalm.65Analytical Questions:Is there a line or phrase that repeats at key junctures in the psalm?How does this refrain divide the psalm into larger structural units (stanzas)?What is the central message of the refrain, and how does its repetition shape the psalm's overall theme and emotional trajectory?VI. Rhythm and CadenceThis section addresses the prosody of Hebrew poetry, clarifying the scholarly consensus on its distinctive rhythmic nature, which is tied more to logic and stress than to syllable counts.Meter & RhythmConcept Name: Meter & RhythmDefinition: Unlike much Western poetry that relies on a strict syllabic meter (a fixed number of syllables per line), the scholarly consensus is that biblical Hebrew poetry is based on an accentual rhythm.68 This means the rhythm is determined by the number of stressed or accented syllables per colon, with the number of unstressed syllables in between being variable.68 This rhythm is not an independent system imposed on the words; rather, it is an emergent property of the parallel structure itself. Because parallel lines often use parallel syntax (e.g., Noun-Verb-Object // Noun-Verb-Object), they naturally result in a similar number of stressed words, creating a "rhythm of thought" or syntactic rhythm.6Function in Poetry: The accentual rhythm creates a distinct cadence and pace appropriate for oral recitation and liturgy. The balance of stresses between the two cola of a line is a key component of parallelism, reinforcing the semantic relationship with a phonetic one. This gives the poetry a powerful, incantatory quality that enhances its emotional impact and aids in memorization.69Canonical Examples (from Psalms): (Note: Stress patterns are most apparent in Hebrew but can be approximated in translation by focusing on major content words.)Psalm 23:1: "יְהוָה רֹעִי // לֹא אֶחְסָר."Psalm 19:1: "הַשָּׁמַיִם מְסַפְּרִים כְּבוֹד-אֵל // וּמַעֲשֵׂה יָדָיו מַגִּיד הָרָקִיעַ."Analytical Questions:When reading the line aloud, how many major stressed words or syllables are in the first colon versus the second?Is there a sense of rhythmic balance, or does one colon feel significantly longer or heavier than the other? How does this affect the meaning?How does the rhythm contribute to the overall feeling or impact of the line (e.g., is it stately and balanced, urgent and short, or falling in a lamenting cadence)?How does the grammatical structure of each colon contribute to its rhythmic feel?

## YOUR EDITORIAL REVIEW CRITERIA

Review the introduction and verse commentary for these issues:

### 1. FACTUAL ERRORS
- Biblical errors (e.g., "Jacob had brothers" when he had only one - Esau)
- Misattributions of texts or quotations
- Incorrect historical or cultural claims
- Mistaken grammatical analysis
- Wrong verse references

### 2. MISSED OPPORTUNITIES
- Interesting insights from the Torah Temimah (re rabbinic use/interpretation) not included
- Illuminating traditional commentary (Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Radak, Meiri, Metzudat David, Malbim) not integrated
- Research questions identified by Macro and Micro analysts not answered (even when answerable with available materials)
- **CRITICAL: Insufficient quotations from sources**:
  * **Liturgical texts mentioned but not quoted**: When liturgical usage is mentioned, the actual liturgical texts should be quoted in Hebrew with English translation to show HOW the verse is used
  * **Biblical parallels cited but not quoted**: When multiple parallels are mentioned (e.g., "this appears in Ps 44:4, 89:16, Prov 16:15"), at least 1-2 should be quoted in Hebrew with English to illustrate the pattern
  * **Concordance patterns described without examples**: When a linguistic pattern is mentioned (e.g., "בְּנֵי אִישׁ often denotes the elite, compare Ps 49:3, 62:10"), show the actual Hebrew text from one of the examples
  * **Figurative language parallels cited without quotation**: When the figurative language database provides parallels, the commentary should QUOTE at least one strong example (Hebrew + English) to demonstrate the pattern
  * Remember: readers are hungry to see the actual Hebrew texts. Citations without quotations disappoint.
- **Liturgical context not addressed**: The research bundle includes detailed information about where and how this psalm (or specific verses/phrases from it) appears in Jewish liturgy. This liturgical usage reveals how Jewish tradition has interpreted and valued the psalm and should be integrated naturally into the commentary, providing quotations where relevant (always translate these into English).
- Weak, forced, unclear or incorrect phonetic analysis. ONLY NOTEWORTHY, STRONG and ILLUMINATING phonetic poetic devices should be pointed out (e.g. alliteration, assonance, onomatopoeia, rhyme, rhythm, meter).
- Authorotative Phonetic transcription provided above in ### PSALM TEXT MUST BE USED to analyze sound patterns.
- Stress analysis ignored: The phonetic transcriptions include stress marking where syllables in **BOLD CAPS** indicate stressed syllables based on Hebrew cantillation marks. For example, `mal-**KHŪTH**-khā` means the middle syllable KHŪTH receives primary stress. If you wish to analyze prosodic patterns, meter, or stress counts, you should add this analysis by counting the **BOLD CAPS** syllables.
- IRRELEVANT phonetic transcriptions. ONLY provide phonetic transcriptions where the pronunciation specifically illustrates the point you are making. Otherwise, just proivide the relevant Hebrew with English translation (not transcriptions). Example of RELEVANT transcription:"The triple anaphora לֹא (LŌ') … לֹא … לֹא gives the line its pulse; read aloud, the negatives strike like posts in a fence...". Example of IRRELEVANT transcription: "The wicked "will not stand" (לֹא־יָקֻמוּ, lō'-yā-QU-mū) in the judgment..."
- Comparative textual insights (e.g. MT vs LXX) not addressed
- NOTEWORTHY poetic devices (e.g. assonance, chiasm, inclusio, parallelism) not described
- Unusual or interesting Hebrew phrases not commented on (e.g., distinctive idioms, unusual word pairings like הֲ֭דַר כְּב֣וֹד הוֹדֶ֑ךָ or עֱז֣וּז נֽוֹרְאֹתֶ֣יךָ)
- Interesting lexical insights in BDB not surfaced
- Concordance patterns not explored or demonstrated with quotations
- Figurative language not analyzed
- Figurative language parallels from database cited but not quoted to demonstrate the pattern
- ANE parallels available but not discussed
- insufficient picture provided of what the psalm is ABOUT (especially if there are unexpected moments or shifts in tone/subject)
- didn't make use of the 'Related Psalms Analysis' section of the research bundle when there are interesting/informative parallels with another psalm


### 3. STYLISTIC PROBLEMS
**Too "LLM-ish" or breathless:**
- Overuse of words like: "masterpiece," "tour de force," "breathtaking," "audacious," "remarkable," "stunning"
- Telling instead of showing (saying "brilliant" instead of demonstrating brilliance through analysis)
**Too academic or "insider" in tone:**
- **Avoid overly technical grammatical phrasing.** Instead of "the perfects are used," prefer "the poet uses the perfect verb tense to convey..." This helps the reader understand you're talking about a verb form without needing prior grammatical knowledge. Avoid overly technical grammatical terms like "genitive".
- **Translate academic jargon into plain English.** 
- AVOID opaque or overly academic terms where there are other terms that would work just as well (e.g. avoid phrases LIKE "biblical topos," "programmatic exemplar").
- **Clarity is paramount.** If a sentence feels like it was written for a dissertation defense, rewrite it for a coffee shop conversation with a clever friend.
- AVOID Unnecessarily complex sentence structures that obscure rather than illuminate
- Biblical citations without quotations (readers want to see the Hebrew text)

**Markup for Phonetic transcription (i.e. transliteration)**:
- **too many phonetic transcriptions clutter the prose. ONLY use transcriptions when the reader NEEDS to know how something was pronounced in order to understand your point about a poetic device. Do NOT transliterate words where the pronunciation does not pertain to the point you are making.** On the other hand, DO always provide the relevant text/words in Hebrew with English TRANSLATION.
- When you use a phonetically transcribed Hebrew word or phrase in your prose, **you MUST include the Hebrew text alongside the phonetic transcription** in the format: Hebrew (phonetic transcription). For example: "The opening line, אַשְׁרֵי־הָאִישׁ (`'ash-rēy-hā-'IY-sh`).
- **You MUST enclose the phonetic transcription in backticks**. This is how the document generator will identify it for italicization.
- When you use a phonetically transcribed Hebrew word or phrase in your prose, **you MUST use the phonetic transcription from the PSALM TEXT section above EXCEPT for the tetragrammaton, which you should render as YHWH**. This ensures consistency and accuracy in pronunciation guidance for readers.
- ALWAYS provide the Hebrew text before the transcription. Do NOT use standalone transcriptions without Hebrew.
  * CORRECT: "The verb יֶהְגֶּה (`yeh-GEH`) is onomotopoeic, evoking a murmuring sound..."
  * INCORRECT: "The verb `yeh-GEH` is onomotopoeic..."

**Should conform to this style:**
- Measured, confident tone (like a distinguished professor)
- Show brilliance through analysis, don't label it
- Use strong verbs and concrete imagery
- Vary sentence structure for readability
- Explain technical terms when needed (e.g., "jussive," "anaphora," "chiasm," "inclusio", "perfect tense")
- Elegant, uncluttered prose for sophisticated lay readers (New Yorker/Atlantic level)
- AVOID pompous tone and fancy terms that signal you're a professor; prove your erudition through the incisive and original quality of your insights and your lapidary prose.
- You are not just a scholar; you are a masterful writer **AND A TEACHER**. You are fashioning legitimate insights and aha! moments for your readers.
- Be clear, even at the expense of brevity. In this BAD example, an interesting quotation from Berakhot 30b is somewhat ruined by insufficient explanation: "עִבְדוּ אֶת־ה׳ בְּיִרְאָה...Rabbinic practice quotes this line to regulate prayer: “In the place of joy, trembling” (Berakhot 30b)." A little more explanation would have made this great. Remember - you are not just a scholar; you are a TEACHER.
- since we are not using footnotes, be liberal about not only CITING, BUT ALSO QUOTING. Most citations should be accompanied by a quotation of the relevant Hebrew text (with English translation). Readers want to see the original text you are discussing.
- **CLARITY IS KING** If it will take an extra sentence to illustrate a point or clarify a traditional commentary, use those words - they are well spent!

### 4. ARGUMENT COHERENCE
- Introduction thesis unclear or unsupported
- Verse commentary disconnected from overall argument
- Logical gaps or contradictions
- Claims without evidence from research materials

### 5. BALANCE ISSUES
- Introduction and verse commentary repeat each other excessively
- Items of interest belong in both: introduction should mention briefly, verse commentary should explore in depth
- Introduction too general, missing specific textual engagement
- Verse commentary too superficial, missing scholarly depth

### 6. UNDEFINED TECHNICAL TERMS
**This is a critical failure. Every technical term MUST be defined.** The definition can be 
- a brief parenthetical note,
- woven directly into the sentence,
- or included as a short explanation at the end of the introductory essay or verse commentary.
EXAMPLES OF TERMS THAT MUST BE DEFINED IF USED:
- **Literary & Rhetorical Terms:** "jussive", "anaphora", "chiasm", "inclusio", **"colon"** (a single line of poetry in a parallel pair), "Vorlage", "hendiadys", "doxology", "merism", "proem", "prefect tense", "wisdom literature", etc.
- **Hebrew Grammatical Terms:** **"intensive stem (Pi'el)"** (a verb form often indicating intensified action), **"Hithpolel"** (a reflexive verb form), etc. Explain what the form *does* functionally.
- **Scholarly Shorthand:** **"BDB"** (the Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon, a standard scholarly dictionary that includes...), "LXX" (the Septuagint, an ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible that sometimes differs from the Masoretic Texts in ways that can reveal...), "MT" (the Masoretic Text, the standard Hebrew version known through...), "11QPsa" (the Psalm scroll from Qumran Cave 11, which contains variant readings that shed light on...)
- **General Academic Terms or terms related to the Ancient Near East:** Any word not in common general lay usage must be clarified (including "ANE").

### 7. AUDIENCE APPROPRIATENESS
- Too academic and inaccessible for intelligent lay readers
- Too simplistic and lacking scholarly rigor
- Missing the balance of being "accessible but not popularizing"
- Missing the spark that makes things interesting for a curious intelligent reader

## YOUR TASK: EDITORIAL REVISION

**Stage 1: Critical Analysis**
First, provide a brief editorial assessment (200-400 words):
- What works well in the current draft?
- What are the main weaknesses?
- What specific revisions are needed?
- What insights from the research bundle were missed?
- What interesting questions were asked by the Macro and Micro analysts but not answered, which CAN be answered with the available research materials?
- Were unusual or interesting Hebrew phrases and poetic devices adequately commented on in the verse-by-verse commentary?

**Figurative Language Assessment:**
- Are interesting biblical parallels from the figurative language database specifically cited (book:chapter:verse)?
- **CRITICAL: Are these parallels QUOTED (Hebrew + English), not just cited?**
- Does the commentary analyze usage patterns (frequency, typical contexts)?
- Does it provide insights beyond generic observations?
- Are comparisons used to illuminate THIS psalm's distinctive usage?
- **Does the commentary show readers actual examples through quotations, or just mention them in passing?**

**Stage 2: Revised Introduction (TWO SECTIONS REQUIRED)**
Rewrite the introduction to address identified weaknesses. The revised introduction must include TWO sections:

**Section 1: Introduction Essay**
- Maintain 800-1600 words (can be longer if genuinely warranted by interesting findings and/or length of the psalm)
- Correct any factual errors
- Surface missed insights from research materials, especially the Torah Temimah and traditional commentaries
- Address answerable questions raised by the Macro and Micro analysts (weave answers into the essay where appropriate)
- Integrate liturgical insights naturally where relevant (don't treat liturgy as separate topic)
- Achieve the target style (Alter/Kugel/Bloom level)
- Define technical terms for lay readers
- Engage specific texts (Hebrew, LXX) with analysis. Your readers DO NOT understand Greek. If you quote Greek, translate into English.
- Leave the reader with a sense of what this psalm is ABOUT (especially if there are unexpected moments or shifts in tone/subject)

**Section 2: Modern Jewish Liturgical Use (REQUIRED)**
The draft you're reviewing ALREADY contains a "## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use" section. Your job is to REVISE and IMPROVE it, NOT to skip it or output just a header.

**MANDATORY ACTIONS:**
1. **Review the existing liturgical section** in the draft introduction
2. **Cross-reference with research bundle** to verify accuracy and add missing details
3. **Restructure into clear subsections using EXACT MARKDOWN HEADING 4 SYNTAX**:

   **⚠️ CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT:**
   - You MUST use markdown Heading 4 syntax: `#### Subheading Name`
   - Do NOT use hyphens: `- Full psalm` ❌ WRONG
   - Do NOT use bullets: `• Full psalm` ❌ WRONG
   - Do NOT use bold: `**Full psalm**` ❌ WRONG
   - Use ONLY the markdown heading syntax: `#### Full psalm` ✅ CORRECT

   **Example of CORRECT formatting:**
   ```
   #### Full psalm

   Many communities recite the entire psalm at Yom Kippur Maariv...

   #### Key verses

   Verse 2 (אַשְׁרֵי־הָאִישׁ, "Happy is the one") appears in...
   ```

   **Required subsections (use only those that apply to this psalm):**
   * `#### Full psalm` - Where/when the complete psalm is recited (if applicable)
   * `#### Key verses` - Each verse used in liturgy, starting with Hebrew + English, then explaining context with Hebrew from the prayers
   * `#### Phrases` - Each phrase used in liturgy, starting with Hebrew + English, then explaining context with Hebrew from the prayers. Where available, provide an illustrative quotation in Hebrew, AND translate into English.
4. **OMIT subsections that don't apply** to this psalm
5. **Add Hebrew quotations** - for EVERY verse/phrase, include Hebrew from both the psalm AND the prayer
6. **Be specific** - name the service, occasion, tradition
7. **Explain significance** - why this usage matters theologically, or is relevant to our understanding of the psalm, or reflects something interesting about how the psalm was received, understood, appropriated or reinterpreted by the tradition.

**Target: 200-500 words** (longer if extensive usage)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Output the COMPLETE revised section with REAL CONTENT. Writing just "## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use" with nothing after it is UNACCEPTABLE and will fail validation.**

**Stage 3: Revised Verse Commentary**
Rewrite the verse-by-verse commentary to address identified weaknesses. For each verse:

- **Audience Hebrew Proficiency**: Your readers are familiar with biblical, rabbinic and liturgical Hebrew. When you quote sources (biblical texts, rabbinic sources, liturgical texts), **YOU MUST PROVIDE THE HEBREW ORIGINAL WELL AS AN ENGLISH TRANSLATION**. Include enough Hebrew to support your point and/or demonstrate things of interest (unusual constructions, wordplay, idioms, etc.). Don't rely solely on translation—let readers see the Hebrew evidence for themselves. 
- Readers will be disappointed if you quote a translation without Hebrew OR provide more than a word or two of Hebrew without an English translation. **Rule of thumb: BOTH Hebrew and English.**
- Don't let space considerations stop you from including both Hebrew and English. Readers will appreciate it and it's fine to go a little longer in order to include both Hebrew and English.

**CRITICAL: You MUST START each verse's commentary with the Hebrew text of that verse, punctuated to show poetic structure.**

- Present the verse using punctuation (semicolons, periods, commas) to illustrate how the verse is poetically divided
- This punctuated presentation helps readers see the verse's structure at a glance
- Example: Original verse "בְּקׇרְאִי עֲנֵנִי ׀ אֱלֹקֵי צִדְקִי בַּצָּר הִרְחַבְתָּ לִּי חׇנֵּנִי וּשְׁמַע תְּפִלָּתִֽי׃" becomes "בְּקׇרְאִי עֲנֵנִי אֱלֹקֵי צִדְקִי; בַּצָּר הִרְחַבְתָּ לִּי; חׇנֵּנִי וּשְׁמַע תְּפִלָּתִי."
- After presenting the punctuated verse, proceed immediately with your commentary

**CRITICAL: ALWAYS show Hebrew and English together when discussing the verse**
- When discussing a Hebrew phrase or word from the verse, ALWAYS provide both the Hebrew text AND its English translation
- NEVER show only the English without the Hebrew, or only the Hebrew without the English
- CORRECT: "Be gracious to me" (חׇנֵּנִי) shows...
- INCORRECT: "Be gracious to me" shows... (missing Hebrew)
- INCORRECT: חׇנֵּנִי shows... (missing English)
- This applies to EVERY quotation from the verse you're analyzing

- **Length**: Target 300-500 words per verse (PLUS the verse itself at the start). Shorter (200-250 words) is acceptable for simple verses with minimal interesting features. Longer (500-800 words) is ENCOURAGED and often NECESSARY for verses with:
  * Unusual Hebrew phrases or idioms (like הֲ֭דַר כְּב֣וֹד הוֹדֶ֑ךָ or עֱז֣וּז נֽוֹרְאֹתֶ֣יךָ)
  * Complex poetic devices (chiasm, inclusio, intricate parallelism)
  * Significant textual variants (MT vs LXX differences)
  * Important interpretive questions that can be answered with research materials
  * Examples of use of the text by aggadic or halachic traditions (see the Torah Temimah); powerful insights into early rabbinic reception and interpretation
  * Rich figurative language requiring comparative analysis

  Remember: intelligent lay readers are HUNGRY for substantive analysis of linguistic and literary features. Don't shortchange them!

- **Scholarly Grounding**: Your analysis must be grounded in the provided research bundle and demonstrate awareness of the principles in the **ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK** document. Use its terminology (e.g., "telescopic analysis," "A is so, and what's more, B") where appropriate to frame your insights.

- **Discretion**: You have full editorial discretion. You are not required to include every detail from the synthesizer's commentary. Your role is to *evaluate* the synthesizer's choices regarding phonetic and figurative language, and then decide whether to retain, enhance, rewrite, or replace them to achieve the highest level of scholarly excellence.

- **Items of interest to include** (when relevant):
  **Interpretation and Reception**, including
    - *Influence of verses and their use in aggada and halacha by the Mishna, Talmud, Midrashim, etc as provided in the Torah Temimah* - make sure to carefully review the Torah Temimah material in the research bundle
    - *Medieval Jewish commentary (Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Radak)*
    - *Jewish commentaries of the modern era (Metzudat David, Malbim, Meiri)*
    - *Contemporary Jewish theologian Rabbi Jonathan Sacks if relevant*
    - Make sure to read the "### About the Commentators" section in the research bundle for context on these commentators
    - **Modern liturgical context (IMPORTANT)**: When a verse (or phrase from it) appears in Jewish liturgy, comment on this usage and what it reveals about reception and interpretation/re-interpretation. Be specific about the prayer name, service, occasion, and tradition. Integrate liturgical insights naturally. **CRITICAL: Quote generously from the liturgy in Hebrew (always with English translation) to SHOW how the verse is used, not just mention that it appears.**
    - Church fathers and medieval Christian interpretation if very illuminating
    - Modern critical scholarship debates
  * **Figurative language analysis** (how does the usage of similar figuration elsewhere shed light on how it's functioning here?) **CRITICAL: Quote generously from other biblical passages (Hebrew + English translation) to illustrate your points - at least 1-2 strong examples when parallels are available. Don't just cite references; SHOW the texts.** Use your unique figurative language resource to your advantage!
  * Poetics (parallelism, wordplay, structure, clever devices, recurring words, sound patterns (USE the authoritative phonetic information you are provided above to conduct this analysis and illustrate your point to readers)). An INTERMEDIATE example: "Either way, the image is of liquid overrun. The verse even sounds like water: the sibilants and liquids—אשׂכה… בכל־לילה… בדמעתי… ערשי אמסה—create a hush and hiss that matches the meaning." This would have been EXCELLENT if it had also included the authoratative phonetic transcription to DEMONSTRATE the sounds to readers, AND if it had noted that this linguistic pattern CONTINUES in the NEXT verse, which begins "עָשְׁשָׁ֣ה מִכַּ֣עַס ".
  * **Unusual turns of phrase**: When a verse contains an interesting or unusual Hebrew phrase, idiom, or construction (like הֲ֭דַר כְּב֣וֹד הוֹדֶ֑ךָ or עֱז֣וּז נֽוֹרְאֹתֶ֣יךָ), comment on it—explain what makes it distinctive, how it functions poetically, and what it contributes to the verse's meaning
  * Literary insights (narrative techniques, rhetorical strategies)
  * Historical and cultic insights (worship setting, historical context)
  * Comparative religion (ANE parallels, theological contrasts)
  * Grammar and syntax (especially when illuminating)
  * Textual criticism (MT vs LXX, hints about Vorlage). You readers do NOT know Greek. If you quote Greek, translate into English.
  * **Comparative biblical usage** (concordance insights showing how terms/phrases appear elsewhere). **CRITICAL: When mentioning that a word or phrase appears elsewhere, QUOTE at least one illustrative example (Hebrew + English) to demonstrate the pattern. Don't just say "this appears in Psalm X" - show what Psalm X actually says.** Quote generously from other Biblical passages where illustrative.
  * Timing/composition clues (vocabulary, theology, historical references)
  * Interesting parallels with other psalms, when convincing and illuminating (use the 'Related Psalms Analysis' section of the research bundle)

**Figurative Language Integration:**
For verses with figurative language where research provided biblical parallels:
- MUST QUOTE at least one specific biblical parallel from the database (Hebrew + English, with book:chapter:verse)
- MUST analyze the usage pattern (frequency, typical contexts)
- MUST note how this psalm's use compares to typical usage
- SHOULD provide insight beyond generic observation. Why was THIS figuration chosen by the poet? What can we learn about its senses from how it's used elsewhere? Think deeply and carefully about this!

Example of EXCELLENT: "He shall be like a tree transplanted by channels of water" (v. 3). The participle שָׁתוּל (`shathul`) is precise; BDB glosses it "transplanted," a term used of vines or trees deliberately set in a chosen place. Jeremiah uses it in a parallel image: שָׁת֤וּל עַל־מַ֙יִם֙ ('planted by water,' Jer 17:8). The site here is not random: פַּלְגֵי־מָיִם are divided channels, irrigation runnels, rather than a single stream. This is cultivation as much as nature."

Example of BAD: "Verse 16 speaks of God opening his hand. This imagery appears elsewhere in Scripture." (too vague, no specific citations, no quotations, no pattern analysis, no INSIGHT)

Example of WEAK: "The 'opened hand' imagery appears 23 times in Scripture as an idiom for generosity (Deut 15:8, 11)." (cites but doesn't quote - readers don't see the actual Hebrew text demonstrating the pattern)

- **Address interesting questions**: When relevant to specific verses, address answerable questions raised by the Macro and Micro analysts
- **Complement the introduction**: Don't repeat what the introduction covered in depth; add verse-specific detail
- **Correct style**: Avoid breathless LLM language; show rather than tell
- **Define terms and ensure accesibility**: Scrupulously apply the rules from criteria #4 (Stypistic Problems) and #6 (Undefined Technical Terms). Rewrite any sentence that sounds like it belongs in an academic journal. And ensure all technical terms have a definition in-line or after the commentary.
- **Emphasize the interesting**: Make sure to comment on unusual turns of phrase, distinctive Hebrew idioms, and poetic devices. These linguistic and literary features are precisely what intelligent lay readers find fascinating.
- **REMEMBER**: Very curious intelligent readers are depending on you to be their guide through this compelling, mysterious and enduring text that has been studied and recited with fervor for millenia. Give them new insights and deeply enhance their encounter with this work.
- **REMEMBER**: You have deep access to resources that NO scholar has had complete access to before. Use this to your advantage to produce truly outstanding commentary.

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: LITURGICAL SUMMARY

**⚠️ MANDATORY: You MUST write a complete `## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use` section with actual content.**

This is NOT optional. This is NOT a placeholder. You MUST:
1. **Find the liturgical data** in the research bundle (look for sections titled "Modern Jewish Liturgical Use (Psalm N)" or "Phrase-Level Liturgical Usage")
2. **Write actual content** - the section cannot be empty or contain only the header
3. **Use the proper structure with CORRECT MARKDOWN SYNTAX**:
   - Include subsections using Heading 4 markdown: `#### Full psalm`, `#### Key verses`, `#### Phrases` (as appropriate for THIS psalm)
   - **DO NOT USE HYPHENS OR BULLETS** - use only `####` for subsection headings
   - OMIT subsections that don't apply to this specific psalm
   - For verses and phrases, ALWAYS start with Hebrew text + English translation
   - Include Hebrew quotations from the prayers themselves to illustrate usage, and translate into English
   - for individual verses and phrases that appear in the liturgy, reflect on whether their liturgical use goes with the grain of its natural ("pshat") reading or whether the compilers of the liturgy have put this verse or phrase to use in a novel way.
   - Be specific about occasions, services, and traditions
4. **Target 150-400 words** (can be longer if the psalm has extensive liturgical use)

**Your output will fail validation if this section is empty or missing.**

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Return your response with these THREE sections in order:

### EDITORIAL ASSESSMENT

Write your 200-400 word critical analysis of the current draft.

### REVISED INTRODUCTION

Your revised introduction must have TWO parts (do NOT label them with "PART 1" or "PART 2" - just write the content):

First, write the revised introduction essay (600-1200 words) incorporating improvements from your assessment. Begin directly with the essay content.

Second, IMMEDIATELY after finishing the essay, add a blank line and write this EXACT TEXT as a marker:

---LITURGICAL-SECTION-START---

Then continue with 2-4 substantial paragraphs (200-500 words) about liturgical usage, structured with Heading 4 subsections:

**⚠️ REQUIRED FORMAT - Use markdown Heading 4 (####) for subsections:**

#### Full psalm

[Write content about where/when the complete psalm is recited - which traditions, services, occasions. OMIT this subsection if not applicable.]

#### Key verses

[For EACH verse: Start with Hebrew text + English translation, then explain the prayer context with Hebrew quotations from the prayers. OMIT this subsection if not applicable.]

#### Phrases

[For EACH phrase: Start with Hebrew text + English translation, then explain the prayer context with Hebrew quotations from the prayers. OMIT this subsection if not applicable.]

**DO NOT use hyphens, bullets, or bold for subsection headings - ONLY use #### markdown syntax.**

Use BOTH the existing liturgical content in the draft introduction AND the detailed liturgical data in the research bundle.

Write actual content with specific prayer names, services, and Hebrew quotations.

### REVISED VERSE COMMENTARY

**Verse 1**

[START with the Hebrew text of verse 1, punctuated to show poetic structure (using semicolons, periods, commas). Then proceed with your revised commentary. TARGET: The verse itself PLUS 300-500 words of commentary. Do NOT shortchange the reader—intelligent lay readers want substantive analysis of linguistic and literary features. Aim for 400-500 words when the verse has interesting Hebrew phrases, poetic devices, figurative language, or interpretive questions. Only use 200-300 words for genuinely simple verses.]

**Verse 2**

[START with the Hebrew text of verse 2, punctuated to show poetic structure. Then your revised commentary. TARGET: The verse itself PLUS 300-500 words as above.]

[Continue for all verses...]
