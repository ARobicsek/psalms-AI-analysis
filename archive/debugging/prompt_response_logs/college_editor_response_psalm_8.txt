### EDITORIAL ASSESSMENT

What’s strong here: the draft knows the Hebrew very well, sees the poem’s big arc (praise → human smallness → human dignity → praise), and brings in great sources (Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Radak; LXX; Job 7:17–18; ANE royal ideology; Genesis 1). It also notices fine-grained details like “fingers” (אֶצְבָּעוֹת) vs “hands” (יָדַיִם) and the ambiguity of מֵאֱלֹהִים.

What needs work for first-year college students: the tone sometimes drifts toward academic or homiletic density. Terms like inclusio, Hiphil, and LXX appear without brisk, student-friendly definitions. There are lots of claims about liturgy and parallels, but relatively few concrete Hebrew quotations from those prayers or from the “comparative verses” being cited. For this audience, every interesting claim should be demonstrated with the Hebrew (they can read it!) and a crisp English gloss.

Specific revisions to reach excellence:
- Define every technical term on first use (inclusio, chiasm, Hiphil, merism, etc.).
- Show, don’t just tell: quote the parallel verses you invoke (e.g., Job 7:17–18; Ps 110:1; Prov 18:10).
- Tighten grammar notes (e.g., תְּנָה) into clear, practical options with why-they-matter.
- Make the “why” explicit: Why “fingers” here? Why omit the sun? Why start with baby mouths?
- Liturgy: add brief, accurate, quoted examples from widely used rites; explain what the usage does in prayer.
- Keep the voice conversational (coffee shop, not dissertation), with occasional light humor.

Missed opportunities:
- The Talmudic “angel debate” on מה־אֱנוֹשׁ (Sanhedrin 38b/Shabbat 88b) is gold for showing how Israel wrestled with the “risk” of humanity—bring it in briefly and explain its point.
- Quote a few “strength/fortress” (עֹז) verses to clarify why LXX read “praise.”
- Use the Related Psalms (84:1’s “על-הגיתית,” 144:1’s “אֶצְבְּעוֹתַי”) to reinforce patterns with actual text.

Overall goal: sharper definitions + more Hebrew evidence + clearer “why this matters.”


### REVISED INTRODUCTION

Part 1: The psalm in plain sight (and why it’s so good)

Psalm 8 is small but mighty—ten short verses framed by the same line at start and finish: יְהוָה אֲדֹנֵינוּ מָה־אַדִּיר שִׁמְךָ בְּכׇל־הָאָרֶץ, “O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is Your name in all the earth” (vv. 2, 10). That frame is an inclusio—a literary “bookend” that opens and closes a unit with the same phrase so you read everything inside through it. Inclusio defined; check.

What’s inside? A tight meditation on a big question: how can tiny, fragile humans matter in a universe of moon and stars? The poet moves like this:
- Praise (v. 2): God’s name is glorious across the earth; God’s splendor is “over the heavens.”
- Paradox (v. 3): from baby babble God “founds strength” (יִסַּדְתָּ עֹז)—a fortress made of infant mouths. That’s supposed to be odd. It is.
- Starlit awe (v. 4): the heavens are “the work of Your fingers”—a delicate image.
- The question (v. 5): מָה־אֱנוֹשׁ… “What is man that You remember him?” This is the hinge.
- The answer (vv. 6–9): humanity is almost divine (or almost angelic), crowned with glory, and entrusted with dominion over land animals, birds, and sea creatures.
- Praise again (v. 10): back to the inclusio, now fuller because you’ve seen the argument.

Two quick definitions you’ll see often:
- Parallelism: Hebrew poetry lines come in pairs (or triplets), where the second line “answers” the first by intensifying, specifying, or completing it—think “A is true, and what’s more, B.” (Not just repetition.)
- Merism: saying “X and Y” to mean “everything in between” (like “heaven and earth” = the whole universe).

Now a few puzzles the psalm wants you to notice.

1) “Upon the gittith” (עַל־הַגִּתִּית). The superscription (v. 1) is a musical note we no longer fully understand. It appears in Psalms 8, 81, and 84. Some say it’s an instrument from Gath; the ancient Greek translation (the Septuagint, “LXX”) heard “winepresses.” Either way, it likely marks a tune or festival setting. If you like scavenger hunts, check Ps 84:1: לַמְנַצֵּחַ עַל־הַגִּתִּית.

2) Verse 2’s grammar choice. אֲשֶׁר תְּנָה הוֹדְךָ עַל־הַשָּׁמָיִם could mean “You have set Your splendor above the heavens” (past tense) or “Set Your splendor above the heavens!” (an imperative). Both are possible in Hebrew; either way the point lands: God’s “hod” (splendor) is not confined to earth or sky.

3) Baby mouths, big strength. “From the mouths of infants and sucklings You founded strength” (מִפִּי עוֹלְלִים וְיוֹנְקִים יִסַּדְתָּ עֹז, v. 3). “Founded” is a building verb; עֹז usually means “strength” or “stronghold” (see Prov 18:10: “מִגְדַּל־עֹז,” “a tower of strength”). The LXX, interestingly, translated “praise,” which is why some English Bibles read that way. Hebrew readers feel the “fortress” nuance: God “lays a foundation” of strength using unexpected material—baby talk. The pattern is pervasive in the psalm: God delights in power-through-smallness.

4) “The work of Your fingers.” Fingers (אֶצְבָּעוֹת) in v. 4; hands (יָדֶיךָ) in v. 7. Fingers suggest delicacy; hands suggest power or ownership. Notice how that shift mirrors the poem’s turn—from contemplating fragile filigree (heavens by finger-work) to installed authority (dominion given into human “hands”).

5) The central question. Verse 5 uses two Hebrew words for “human”: אֱנוֹשׁ (enosh, “mortal, frail human”) and בֶּן־אָדָם (ben-adam, “earthling,” literally “child of Adam/soil”). Both verbs are covenant verbs: “remember” (זָכַר) and “visit/attend” (פָּקַד) often mean active care, not just recall (compare Ex 2:24 “God remembered His covenant”; Gen 21:1 “God visited Sarah”). The poet isn’t asking, “Do you know we exist?” but “Why are You so mindful?”

6) Almost divine, almost angelic. Verse 6 is a famous crux: וַתְּחַסְּרֵהוּ מְעַט מֵאֱלֹהִים, “You made him a little less than elohim.” Elohim can mean “God,” “gods,” “divine beings,” or “angels.” The LXX took “angels” (hence Hebrews 2:7), medieval Jewish commentators often followed, and the Hebrew easily bears that reading. But “a little less than God” also fits the grammar and makes a sharp theological claim: humans, made in God’s image (Gen 1:26–27), are near the divine in vocation. Either way, the next line makes the point: “You crown him with glory (כָּבוֹד) and majesty (הָדָר).” Words used for God are shared with humanity. That’s the psalm’s shocker.

7) Democratized kingship. In the Ancient Near East, only the king was the “image of god” and the world was under his feet. Psalm 8 universalizes royalty. Every human bears glory and authority (vv. 6–9), and the imagery is royal: “You put everything under his feet” (כֹּל שַׁתָּה תַּחַת־רַגְלָיו), echoing the footstool motif (compare Ps 110:1: “הֲדֹם לְרַגְלֶיךָ,” “a footstool for your feet”).

8) The catalog of dominion (vv. 8–9). It moves from domestic animals (צֹנֶה = flocks; אֲלָפִים = cattle), to wild animals (בַּהֲמוֹת שָׂדָי), to birds (צִפּוֹר שָׁמַיִם), to fish (דְגֵי הַיָּם), to the cool kicker: “עֹבֵר אׇרְחוֹת יַמִּים,” “whatever travels the paths of the seas.” Paths in the sea? Either human navigation (ships!) or creaturely migration (whales!). It’s poetry you can sail on.

The psalm’s genius is not just what it says but how it says it. The infant fortress, the fingers-to-hands shift, the night-sky omission of the sun (you don’t see stars at noon), the placement of the question at the center—all of that teaches you to see. And it answers the “why” behind human dignity. You are dust (Gen 2:7), yes. But you are dust noticed, visited, crowned, and entrusted.

If you want one rabbinic midrash that captures the courage of this theology, the Talmud imagines angels warning God not to create such risky creatures as us: “What is man that You remember him?” (Ps 8:5). God creates us anyway and says, “Even to old age I am He… I will bear” (Is 46:4; Sanhedrin 38b). Human dignity in Psalm 8 isn’t flattery. It’s responsibility, borne by a God willing to keep bearing with us.

One last literary delight: Psalm 8 talks to other psalms. Psalm 144:1 says, “הַמְלַמֵּד יָדַי לַקְרָב; אֶצְבְּעוֹתַי לַמִּלְחָמָה,” “who trains my hands for battle; my fingers for war”—hands and fingers together, now in military key. Psalm 84 shares the same mysterious header “עַל־הַגִּתִּית.” Let the echoes deepen your hearing.

Read Psalm 8 under the stars sometime. Say v. 4 out loud: כִּֽי־אֶרְאֶ֣ה שָׁמֶיךָ מַעֲשֵׂ֣ה אֶצְבְּעֹתֶ֑יךָ. It still works.

  
---LITURGICAL-SECTION-START---

#### Full psalm
Several communities recite all of Psalm 8 in the Seder Yom Kippur Katan, the “minor Yom Kippur” liturgy before each new month. The psalm’s creation theme frames repentance as care for “the work of Your hands.”

#### Key verses
- יְהוָה אֲדֹנֵינוּ מָה־אַדִּיר שִׁמְךָ בְּכׇל־הָאָרֶץ (8:10) “O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is Your name in all the earth.”  
  In many High Holiday rites this line is woven into Kedushah expansions or closing praises. It punctuates the day’s theme: divine kingship revealed “in all the earth.”

- בְּמַעֲשֵׂי יָדֶיךָ (8:7) “the work of Your hands.”  
  A frequent prayer refrain—especially in Selichot and Avinu Malkeinu—asks God to have mercy “עַל מַעֲשֵׂה יָדֶיךָ,” “on the work of Your hands,” echoing Ps 8:7. Example (Selichot): “חֽוּסָה ה’ עַל עַמֶּךָ, עַל נַחֲלָתֶךָ, וְעַל מַעֲשֵׂה יָדֶיךָ.” “Have compassion, LORD, on Your people, Your heritage, and the work of Your hands.”

#### Phrases
- כִּֽי־אֶרְאֶ֣ה שָׁמֶיךָ… יָרֵחַ וְכוֹכָבִים (8:4) “When I behold Your heavens… the moon and the stars.”  
  In many Sephardi Kiddush Levanah (Sanctification of the Moon) rites, worshippers recite verses about the moon’s creation; some communities include Ps 8:4 and close with 8:10, linking monthly renewal to the psalm’s night-sky wonder.

- מִפִּי עוֹלְלִים וְיוֹנְקִים (8:3) “From the mouths of infants and sucklings.”  
  This line appears in some Kedushah piyyutim (poetic additions) as an image of humble praise that silences pride. It often introduces the idea that even the simplest voices are part of heaven’s sanctification of God.

These uses highlight two things Psalm 8 loves: (1) God’s majesty seen in creation, and (2) human beings as “the work of Your hands,” responsible to praise—and protect—what God has made.


### REVISED VERSE COMMENTARY

**Verse 1**  
לַמְנַצֵּחַ עַל־הַגִּתִּית; מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד.  

Two quick pieces. First, לַמְנַצֵּחַ (“for the leader”) marks a performance direction—think “to the choirmaster.” Second, עַל־הַגִּתִּית (al‑haggittit) is the head-scratcher. It shows up only in Psalms 8, 81, and 84. Three live options:
- An instrument or tune from Gath (a Philistine city)—Rashi goes this way.
- A musical mode or choir assignment (Ibn Ezra; Radak mentions this too).
- The LXX reads “about the winepresses,” hinting at a harvest-festival tune.

Why care? Because Psalms 8, 81, 84 all mix creation/kingship themes with temple praise. So “gittith” likely signals a festive, communal setting where cosmic sovereignty and human vocation are on display. Also, this is “מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד,” “a psalm of David,” which in the Psalter often marks royal theology—useful to keep in mind when v. 6–9 democratize royal imagery for all humans.

Notice how little you need to make a world: a leader, a tune, and a question under the stars.

**Verse 2**  
יְהוָה אֲדֹנֵינוּ, מָה־אַדִּיר שִׁמְךָ בְּכׇל־הָאָרֶץ; אֲשֶׁר תְּנָה הוֹדְךָ עַל־הַשָּׁמָיִם.  

The double name—יְהוָה אֲדֹנֵינוּ (“YHWH, our Lord”)—holds intimacy (“our”) and sovereignty (“Lord”) together. The line “מָה־אַדִּיר” is wonder-speech: “How majestic!” The framing role of this sentence makes it an inclusio (bookend) for the psalm (see also v. 10).

The puzzle is אֲשֶׁר תְּנָה הוֹדְךָ עַל־הַשָּׁמָיִם. Hebrew allows two readings of תְּנָה here:
- “You have set Your splendor above the heavens” (past declaration).
- “Set Your splendor above the heavens!” (imperative—an exhortation).

Either way, “above the heavens” asserts transcendence: God is not the sky; God’s splendor outruns it. This matters because v. 4 will bring us back to the moon and stars as “finger-work.” The poet begins by placing God beyond the heavens before turning to their beauty. It keeps us from nature-worship while letting us adore nature as art.

Sound note: “מָה־אַדִּיר” pairs well with “הוֹדְךָ”—you can almost feel the loft in the vowels. Say it out loud.

—

**Verse 3**  
מִפִּי עוֹלְלִים וְיוֹנְקִים, יִסַּדְתָּ עֹז; לְמַעַן צֹרְרֶיךָ, לְהַשְׁבִּית אוֹיֵב וּמִתְנַקֵּם.  

The whiplash is intentional: from “above the heavens” to infant mouths. Two terms for tiny humans—עֺלְלִים (babes) and יוֹנְקִים (nurslings). “יִסַּדְתָּ” means “You have founded/laid a foundation.” עֹז usually means “strength/stronghold.” So: “Out of baby mouths, You established a fortress.” The LXX famously reads “praise,” but the Hebrew image is a fortress built out of babble. That’s delicious paradox: God defeats foes with what looks like weakness.

Who are the foes (צֹרְרֶיךָ… אוֹיֵב וּמִתְנַקֵּם)? In a creation psalm, probably not Philistines. Think cosmic opponents to God’s rule: chaos, arrogance, anything that pretends to be ultimate. Note the verb לְהַשְׁבִּית (“to silence/stop”). Infant praise “shuts down” the enemy.

Two quick intertexts:
- Proverbs 18:10 calls God’s name a “tower of strength” (מִגְדַּל־עֹז). Strength as a fortress is a biblical pattern.
- Matthew 21:16 quotes this verse when children shout “Hosanna” in the Temple. That follows the LXX “praise” reading. Our Hebrew still sings “fortress”—God’s “defense system” often looks like the world’s weakness.

Talmudic footnote: Sanhedrin 38b imagines angels citing our verse’s “what is man?” to argue against humanity. God tolerates the risk. So, yes, infant praise is risky too. God’s OK with that.

—

**Verse 4**  
כִּֽי־אֶרְאֶה שָׁמֶיךָ, מַעֲשֵׂה אֶצְבְּעֹתֶיךָ; יָרֵחַ וְכוֹכָבִים, אֲשֶׁר כּוֹנָנְתָּה.  

We move to first-person wonder: “When I behold Your heavens…” Two details jump out.

(1) “The work of Your fingers” (מַעֲשֵׂה אֶצְבְּעֹתֶיךָ). Not hands—fingers. Fingers suggest delicate craftsmanship (compare Ex 31:18: “written by the finger of God”). The heavens are filigree, not brute force.

(2) Moon and stars, not the sun. Likely because the poet is literally looking at the night sky. Also, Genesis 1 intentionally demythologizes sun and moon as mere “lights.” Psalm 8 goes smaller still: finger-work “set in place” (כּוֹנָנְתָּה—established firmly). Order, not combat, builds this world.

Liturgical aside: many Sephardi Kiddush Levanah rites recite verses about the moon’s establishment; some communities include Ps 8:4 before blessing the new moon. It fits: you’re literally gazing at “מַעֲשֵׂה אֶצְבְּעֹתֶיךָ.”

—

**Verse 5**  
מָה־אֱנוֹשׁ, כִּי־תִזְכְּרֶנּוּ; וּבֶן־אָדָם, כִּי תִפְקְדֶנּוּ.  

The question at the center. Two terms for “human”: אֱנוֹשׁ (frail mortal) and בֶּן־אָדָם (earthling). Two verbs of divine attentiveness:
- זָכַר (remember): often means remember-and-act (Ex 2:24; Ps 106:4).
- פָּקַד (visit/attend): purposeful visitation for care or judgment (Gen 21:1; Ex 32:34).

So the sense is: “What are frail mortals that You actively remember them, earthlings that You personally attend to them?” Under the stars, that is a fair question.

Counter-voice: Job 7:17–18 flips this into protest—“What is man that You make much of him… that You examine him every morning?” Same vocabulary, different mood. The Bible keeps both prayers: amazed gratitude (Psalm 8) and weary complaint (Job). That’s honest religion.

A favorite rabbinic story (Sanhedrin 38b): when the angels objected to creating such a risky species, God created us anyway and said, “Even to gray hairs I will bear.” Human dignity in the Bible rests not on our size or strength but on God’s stubborn attention.

—

**Verse 6**  
וַתְּחַסְּרֵהוּ מְעַט מֵאֱלֹהִים; וְכָבוֹד וְהָדָר תְּעַטְּרֵהוּ.  

Here’s the crux. מֵאֱלֹהִים can mean “God” or “divine beings/angels.” The LXX chose “angels,” which shaped Hebrews 2:7 (“for a little while lower than the angels”). The Hebrew allows either:
- “A little less than God” → maximal imago Dei; audacious.
- “A little less than angels” → humanity as near the angelic; classic Jewish medieval reading (Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Radak).

Either way, the effect is royal: “You crown him (תְּעַטְּרֵהוּ) with glory and majesty.” Those are God-words (e.g., Ps 104:1: “הוֹד וְהָדָר לָבָשְׁתָּ,” “You are clothed in splendor and majesty”). Psalm 8 spreads the coronation beyond kings to every human. It democratizes royal ideology: not “the king alone is God’s image,” but “humanity as such is crowned.” That has ethical teeth: dignity is universal.

The verb עָטַר (“to crown/encircle”) appears again in Ps 65:12: “You crown the year with Your goodness.” Crowns encircle. Here, dignity encircles human life—not self-bestowed, but given.

—

**Verse 7**  
תַּמְשִׁילֵהוּ בְּמַעֲשֵׂי יָדֶיךָ; כֹּל שַׁתָּה תַחַת־רַגְלָיו.  

Dominion installed. תַּמְשִׁילֵהוּ (Hiphil: “You cause him to rule”) stresses delegation—humans don’t seize authority; God grants it. “Over the work of Your hands”: the same creation whose heavens were finger-work is handed to human stewardship. The shift from fingers (v. 4) to hands (v. 7) is lovely: delicate heavens vs. entrusted earth.

“Everything under his feet” echoes royal imagery (cf. Ps 110:1: “Make your enemies a footstool”) but is defanged here: not enemies, creation itself is “underfoot,” i.e., placed within human responsibility. Footstool language also marks God’s presence (Ps 99:5; 132:7). Psalm 8 is careful: God remains King; human rule is vice-regency.

In short: image-of-God means stewardship, not entitlement.

—

**Verse 8**  
צֹנֶה וַאֲלָפִים כֻּלָּם; וְגַם בַּהֲמוֹת שָׂדָי.  

The dominion catalog begins with the animals humans live with:
- צֹנֶה (a rare form for צֹאן): flocks—sheep and goats.
- אֲלָפִים: cattle/oxen.
- “All of them”—broad coverage, likely also working animals (horses, donkeys, camels) by implication, as Radak notes.
- Then “also beasts of the field” (wildlife).

Rashi notes צֹנֶה likely carries the sense of managed flocks (as in Num 32:24 “גְּדֵרוֹת לְצֹנַאֲכֶם,” “pens for your flocks”). The movement is sensible: from most domesticated to less so. Dominion here is not about crushing; it’s about culture—tending, harnessing, learning.

Ethically, this line supports a stewardship reading of “rule”: the creatures nearest our livelihood (food, clothing, labor) are precisely those we’re bound to care for.

—

**Verse 9**  
צִפּוֹר שָׁמַיִם וּדְגֵי הַיָּם; עֹבֵר אׇרְחוֹת יַמִּים.  

Now sky and sea. “Birds of the heavens… fish of the sea.” The finale is poetic and fascinating: “whatever travels the paths of the seas.” Two good readings:
- Human navigation: by ingenuity we “pass through” sea-paths (ships!), extending dominion to the realm least natural to us.
- Marine migration: creatures literally travel sea “paths”—currents and routes known to whales and salmon long before sonar.

Either way, order has been inscribed on the waters. The line resonates with creation’s subduing of the watery deep (without naming any chaos monster here) and extends human agency into the far places. Fun fact: nineteenth-century oceanographer Matthew Maury credited “paths of the seas” with inspiring his study of ocean currents.

In short: Psalm 8 riffs on Genesis 1:26–28’s “rule over fish of the sea and birds of the heavens,” but adds the maritime flourish to make you feel it.

—

**Verse 10**  
יְהוָה אֲדֹנֵינוּ, מָה־אַדִּיר שִׁמְךָ בְּכׇל־הָאָרֶץ.  

Back to the opening line—the inclusio closes. Notice the small but meaningful omission: v. 2 added “Set Your splendor above the heavens”; v. 10 does not. Why? Because the poem has already shown it. After walking through infants, stars, a central question, a coronation, and a creaturely catalog, you don’t need to say “above the heavens” again. The journey has made God’s majesty “in all the earth” visible in a new way—through human vocation exercised within creation.

Liturgically, this line is a natural doxology—no surprise it shows up in High Holiday praise. Theologically, endings like this are invitations: go do the dominion well, and the earth will be full of “how majestic is Your name.” That’s a good last line to carry back into daylight from a starry night.
