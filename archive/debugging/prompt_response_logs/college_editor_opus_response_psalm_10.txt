### EDITORIAL ASSESSMENT

**What works well:** The draft demonstrates genuine scholarly depth. It correctly identifies the three-fold "says in his heart" formula as structurally significant, recognizes the broken acrostic's theological implications, and grasps the central irony—both psalmist and wicked agree God is hidden but draw opposite conclusions. The verse commentary shows real engagement with Rashi, Ibn Ezra, and Radak. The predator imagery analysis is solid.

**Main weaknesses for a college student audience:**

1. **Too dissertation-like:** The introduction reads like a scholarly monograph. Phrases like "spatial theology," "formal theodicy," "prophetic perfect," and "performative utterance" drop without definition. A first-year student would drown.

2. **Jargon flood:** Terms like "colon," "Leitwort," "Ketiv/Qere," "hiphil," "perfective of conviction" appear constantly without explanation. This violates the fundamental accessibility requirement.

3. **Missing the engaging voice:** Where's the "coolest professor in the department"? The draft is competent but not exciting. No analogies, no "here's what makes this fascinating," no moments of discovery.

4. **Liturgical section cut off:** The liturgical material ends mid-sentence and isn't properly integrated with quotations.

5. **Verse commentaries too long and academic:** Many exceed 500 words and read like encyclopedia entries rather than teaching.

6. **Missed research opportunities:** The Torah Temimah's brilliant connection between "the greedy one blesses" and stolen goods (Bava Kamma 94a) deserves spotlight. The connection to Birkat HaMinim in the Amidah is barely mentioned. The related psalms analysis wasn't utilized at all—Psalm 94's parallel orphan/stranger motif and Psalm 44's hidden-face lament create a powerful intertextual conversation.

7. **Not enough "why":** The draft describes *what* but rarely explains *why* the poet made these choices or why it matters.

### REVISED INTRODUCTION

### The Problem This Psalm Won't Stop Asking

Here's a question that has haunted believers for millennia: if God is good and powerful, why does evil flourish? Why do oppressors get rich while their victims suffer? Psalm 10 doesn't offer a tidy philosophical answer. Instead, it does something more interesting—it stages a confrontation between two competing theologies, letting us overhear the wicked man's internal monologue and then dramatically refuting it.

This psalm is essentially a courtroom drama set inside someone's head. We get three separate quotations of what the wicked man "says in his heart" (אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ)—a Hebrew expression meaning something like "thinks to himself" (verses 6, 11, and 13). Through these interior monologues, the psalmist exposes the theological corruption that makes violence possible. The wicked doesn't believe God is watching. And here's the devastating irony: the psalmist opens the poem agreeing with him. "Why, O LORD, do you stand aloof?" (לָמָ֣ה יְ֭הֹוָה תַּעֲמֹ֣ד בְּרָח֑וֹק, verse 1). Both the suffering believer and the cruel oppressor see the same apparent reality—God seems absent. They just draw radically different conclusions from it.

### A Broken Alphabet for a Broken World

Before diving in, you should know something strange about this psalm's structure. Ancient Jewish tradition (preserved in the Septuagint, the Greek translation made around 250 BCE) combined Psalms 9 and 10 into a single composition—and for good reason. Together, they form what scholars call an acrostic poem, where each section begins with successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet. But here's the thing: the acrostic is broken. Letters are missing. Stanzas skip. The alphabet stutters.

This isn't ancient sloppiness. The structural fracture *enacts* what the psalm describes. In a world where the wicked prosper and God seems distant, even the orderly alphabet of divine justice appears incomplete. The form itself becomes a kind of theological argument.

### The Anatomy of Evil (Verses 2-11)

The heart of this psalm is an unprecedented psychological portrait of the oppressor. The poet doesn't just describe what the wicked *does*—he exposes what the wicked *thinks*. Watch the progression through those three interior monologues:

**First monologue (verse 6):** "I shall not be shaken, through all time never be in trouble" (בַּל־אֶמּ֑וֹט לְדֹ֥ר וָ֝דֹ֗ר). This is raw self-confidence—the wicked believes his success is permanent.

**Second monologue (verse 11):** "God has forgotten; He hides His face; He never looks" (שָׁ֣כַֽח אֵ֑ל הִסְתִּ֥יר פָּ֝נָ֗יו בַּל־רָאָ֥ה לָנֶֽצַח). Now his confidence has become theological—God isn't paying attention.

**Third monologue (verse 13):** "You do not call to account" (לֹ֣א תִדְרֹֽשׁ). The full denial: God won't investigate or punish.

This is what scholars call "practical atheism"—not denying God exists, but living as if God doesn't matter. Notice how this echoes Psalm 14:1, "The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God'" (אָמַר נָבָל בְּלִבּוֹ אֵין אֱלֹהִים). Same formula, same interior corruption.

Between these monologues, the psalmist paints the wicked as a predator. He lurks "in ambush" (בְּמַאְרַב), hides "in secret places" (בַּמִּסְתָּרִים), and waits "like a lion in his lair" (כְּאַרְיֵ֬ה בְסֻכֹּ֗ה). Then the metaphor shifts—he's also a hunter pulling shut his net (בְּמׇשְׁכ֥וֹ בְרִשְׁתּֽוֹ). The mixing of predator images (lion AND net-hunter) might seem sloppy, but it's deliberate: the wicked is dangerous in multiple ways simultaneously. He's both raw power and calculated trap.

### The Turning Point: "You DO See!"

Everything shifts in verse 14. After eleven verses of complaint and description, the psalmist suddenly declares: רָאִ֡תָה כִּי־אַתָּ֤ה עָ֘מָ֤ל וָכַ֨עַס תַּבִּיט֮—"You DO look! You behold mischief and vexation!"

This emphatic "You have seen" (רָאִתָה) directly contradicts the wicked's claim that God "never looks" (בַּל־רָאָ֥ה). The Hebrew verb form here (what grammarians call the "perfect tense," indicating completed action) is fronted—put first in the sentence—for maximum rhetorical punch. It's as if the psalmist interrupts himself: "Wait—You *have* seen this. You're seeing it right now."

Here's the theological genius: the very act of praying contradicts the wicked's theology. If God doesn't listen, why pray? The psalmist's petition *demonstrates* that God's absence is only apparent. Prayer itself is an act of faith against the evidence.

### Wordplay as Theology

One of the most elegant features of this psalm is how it plays with the Hebrew root דרש (d-r-sh), which means "to seek, inquire, or call to account." Watch how it threads through the poem:

- Verse 4: The wicked thinks, "He does not call to account" (בַּל־יִדְרֹ֑שׁ)
- Verse 13: "You do not call to account" (לֹ֣א תִדְרֹֽשׁ)  
- Verse 15: The psalmist prays, "Seek his wickedness" (תִּֽדְרוֹשׁ־רִשְׁע֥וֹ)

The wicked's confident denial becomes the psalmist's petition. What the oppressor says God won't do, the psalmist asks God to do. The same word becomes the weapon of reversal.

### An Unexpected Declaration

Then comes verse 16, and the genre suddenly shifts. After all that complaint and petition, the psalmist declares: "The LORD is king forever and ever; the nations have perished from His land" (יְהֹוָ֣ה מֶ֭לֶךְ עוֹלָ֣ם וָעֶ֑ד אָבְד֥וּ ג֝וֹיִ֗ם מֵאַרְצֽוֹ). This isn't argument; it's proclamation. It's what linguists call a "performative utterance"—speech that doesn't just describe reality but creates it. By declaring God's kingship *despite* the evidence, the psalmist resists the wicked's worldview.

The Hebrew verb "have perished" (אָבְדוּ) is grammatically past tense—as if it's already happened. This is "prophetic perfect"—using completed-action grammar for future events you're absolutely certain about. The nations *will* perish, but the psalmist's certainty makes him speak of it as done.

### What This Psalm Teaches Us

Psalm 10 doesn't solve the problem of evil. It doesn't explain why God sometimes seems absent while wickedness flourishes. What it does is more valuable: it gives us language for the crisis. It validates the question "Why?" while modeling how faith speaks back. The psalmist doesn't pretend everything is fine. He complains vigorously. But he also refuses to let the wicked's theology be the final word.

The movement from "Why do You stand aloof?" (verse 1) to "The LORD is king forever" (verse 16) isn't a logical argument. It's a journey of faith—from honest protest through unflinching description to defiant proclamation. Both the first and last words are true: God does sometimes seem hidden, AND God is eternal king. Living with that tension, refusing to collapse it in either direction, is what this psalm teaches.

---LITURGICAL-SECTION-START---

## Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

Psalm 10 isn't recited as a complete psalm in standard Jewish liturgy, but several of its verses have found significant homes in prayer, precisely at moments where the psalm's themes—divine hiddenness, God's attentiveness to the humble, the hope for justice—become liturgically potent.

#### Key verses

**Verse 16: יְהֹוָ֣ה מֶ֭לֶךְ עוֹלָ֣ם וָעֶ֑ד אָבְד֥וּ ג֝וֹיִ֗ם מֵאַרְצֽוֹ ("The LORD is king forever and ever; the nations have perished from His land")**

This kingship declaration holds a stable position in the *Pesukei Dezimra* (Verses of Praise) in Sefardic and Mizrachi morning services. It appears within *Yehi Khvod*, a collection of verses celebrating divine sovereignty. The liturgy places it immediately after a threefold declaration of God's reign across all time:

יְהֹוָה מֶֽלֶךְ, יְהֹוָה מָלָךְ, יְהֹוָה יִמְלֹךְ לְעֹלָם וָעֶד: יְהֹוָה מֶֽלֶךְ עוֹלָם וָעֶד אָבְדוּ גוֹיִם מֵאַרְצוֹ

"The LORD is King, the LORD was King, the LORD will be King forever and ever; The LORD is King forever and ever; nations have perished from His land."

Notice what the liturgy does: it transforms a verse born from theodicy—from wrestling with why evil prospers—into a triumphant affirmation. Every morning, worshippers declare that earthly powers ultimately collapse before God's eternal reign.

**Verse 17: תָּכִ֥ין לִ֝בָּ֗ם תַּקְשִׁ֥יב אׇזְנֶֽךָ ("You will prepare their heart; You will incline Your ear")**

This phrase appears during the High Holiday liturgy, specifically in the chazan's (prayer leader's) repetition of the Amidah. After declaring his unworthiness to represent the congregation, the chazan pleads:

לְחַלּוֹתְךָ שְׁלָחֽוּנִי מַקְהֲלוֹת הֲמוֹנֶֽךָ. תָּכִין לִבָּם תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶֽךָ

"Your teeming congregations have sent me to entreat You. Prepare their heart; incline Your ear."

The shift is remarkable: the prayer leader isn't confident about his own merit, so he asks God to prepare the *worshippers'* hearts. The verse becomes a meditation on how prayer itself requires divine assistance—we can't even pray properly without God's help.

#### Phrases

**Verse 1: לָמָ֣ה יְ֭הֹוָה תַּעֲמֹ֣ד בְּרָח֑וֹק ("Why, O LORD, do You stand aloof?")**

In Sefardic Selichot (penitential prayers) for the fast of the 20th of Sivan—commemorating historical tragedies—this cry appears in a catena of lament verses. The liturgy weaves it with Psalm 44:25's similar question: "Why do You hide Your face?" (לָֽמָּה־פָנֶ֥יךָ תַסְתִּ֑יר). The juxtaposition creates an intensified moment of communal protest, giving voice to generations who experienced God's apparent absence during persecution.

**Verse 15: שְׁ֭בֹר זְר֣וֹעַ רָשָׁ֑ע ("Break the arm of the wicked")**

This petition appears in the Ashkenazi Yom Kippur Musaf during the *Seder HaAvodah*, poetic recounting of Temple service. Following the narrative of ancient priestly glory, the liturgy pivots to supplication:

רֽוּמָה עֻזֶּֽךָ וְרוֹמֵם שְׁפָלִים: שְׁבֹר זְרֽוֹעַ רֶֽשַׁע. תִּמְלֹךְ לְבַדְּךָ בְּקוֹרְאֵי שְׁמֶֽךָ

"Raise Your might and elevate the lowly; break the arm of the wicked; You alone will reign over those who call Your name."

The Talmud (Megillah 17b) connects this verse to the ninth blessing of the Amidah, which asks God to thwart oppressive powers—transforming an ancient psalm's petition into a permanent feature of Jewish daily prayer.

### REVISED VERSE COMMENTARY

**Verse 1**

לָמָ֣ה יְ֭הֹוָה תַּעֲמֹ֣ד בְּרָח֑וֹק; תַּ֝עְלִ֗ים לְעִתּ֥וֹת בַּצָּרָֽה׃

"Why, O LORD, do You stand aloof; why do You hide in times of trouble?"

The psalm explodes open with two parallel "why" questions (לָמָה), a pattern that signals acute theological crisis throughout the Psalter. Compare Psalm 22:2, "My God, my God, why have You abandoned me?" (אֵלִי אֵלִי לָמָה עֲזַבְתָּנִי) or Psalm 44:25, "Why do You hide Your face?" (לָֽמָּה־פָנֶ֥יךָ תַסְתִּ֑יר). These aren't polite inquiries—they're protests.

What makes this opening striking is its spatial language. The verb תַּעֲמֹד ("You stand") normally connotes stability and presence—God "stands" to judge in Psalm 82:1, priests "stand" before God in Deuteronomy 10:8. But here it's modified by בְּרָח֑וֹק ("at a distance"), transforming a posture of strength into one of apparent abandonment. God isn't absent—He's *there*, but far away, like a bystander who could help but doesn't.

The second colon intensifies the complaint. The verb תַּעְלִים (from עלם, "to hide, conceal") often describes divine judgment through withdrawal—as in Deuteronomy 31:17-18, where God warns Israel, "I will hide My face from them" (הִסְתַּרְתִּי פָנַי מֵהֶם). But here the hiddenness is temporally specific: לְעִתּוֹת בַּצָּרָה, "in times of trouble"—precisely when help is most needed. This exact phrase appears in Psalm 9:10, connecting our psalm to its partner and suggesting they form a theological diptych: Psalm 9 celebrates God's past interventions; Psalm 10 confronts His present silence.

Rashi, the great 11th-century French commentator whose concise interpretations became foundational for Jewish study, reads "You hide" as "You hide Your eyes"—God isn't blind, He's choosing not to look. This interpretation sets up the psalm's central drama: will God continue averting His gaze, or will He see?

The irony that will unfold across this psalm begins here: the psalmist's complaint mirrors what the wicked will claim in verse 11 ("He hides His face, He never looks"). Both agree on the apparent reality—God seems hidden. Their responses diverge completely.

**Verse 2**

בְּגַאֲוַ֣ת רָ֭שָׁע יִדְלַ֣ק עָנִ֑י; יִתָּפְשׂ֓וּ בִּמְזִמּ֖וֹת ז֣וּ חָשָֽׁבוּ׃

"In the arrogance of the wicked, the poor is hotly pursued; may they be caught in the schemes they have devised."

The first colon establishes causation: arrogance (גַּאֲוָה) drives violence. The noun appears only seven times in Psalms, always describing the wicked's posture toward both God and people. In Psalm 31:19, it's paired with contempt; in Psalm 73:6, it adorns the wicked like a necklace. Here, arrogance isn't merely pride—it's the engine of oppression.

The verb יִדְלַק is wonderfully vivid. It comes from דלק, meaning "to burn" or "pursue hotly," suggesting passionate, relentless hunting. Ibn Ezra, the brilliant 12th-century Spanish grammarian and philosopher, correctly glosses it as יִרְדֹּף ("he pursues"), pointing to Genesis 31:36 where Laban accuses Jacob: "that you pursued me hotly" (כִּי דָלַקְתָּ אַחֲרָי). The imperfect verb form (indicating ongoing or habitual action) suggests this isn't a one-time attack but continuous predation.

The object is עָנִי (the poor, afflicted), the first of five different Hebrew terms for victims in this psalm. The variety—עָנִי, חֵלְכָה, נָקִי, יָתוֹם, דָּךְ—prevents us from reducing oppression to a single category. The wicked prey on the vulnerable in all their forms.

Then something startling: the second colon shifts to a wish or prayer. יִתָּפְשׂוּ ("may they be caught") is jussive—a verb form expressing desire, not description. The psalmist interrupts his portrait of wickedness with a curse: let the schemers be trapped by their own schemes. The phrase זוּ חָשָׁבוּ ("which they devised") uses an archaic demonstrative pronoun, giving the line an elevated, poetic quality.

Radak (Rabbi David Kimhi, 13th-century Provence), whose clear explanations became standard for studying the Prophets, notes this pattern: description followed by imprecation. The psalm won't passively observe evil—it demands reversal.

---

**Verse 3**

כִּֽי־הִלֵּ֣ל רָ֭שָׁע עַל־תַּאֲוַ֣ת נַפְשׁ֑וֹ; וּבֹצֵ֥עַ בֵּ֝רֵ֗ךְ נִ֘אֵ֥ץ יְהֹוָֽה׃

"For the wicked boasts about his soul's desire; the grasping one blesses himself, scorning the LORD."

The כִּי ("for") explains why the wicked deserves to be caught: his arrogance extends from social violence to theological rebellion. The verb הִלֵּל ("boast, praise") is intensified in form (what grammarians call the Pi'el stem, indicating emphatic or repeated action). The wicked doesn't quietly enjoy success—he advertises it.

The phrase תַּאֲוַת נַפְשׁוֹ ("his soul's desire") is revealing. The noun נֶפֶשׁ can mean "soul" but etymologically relates to "throat"—the organ of appetite. The wicked has a soul that *craves*, and he boasts about satisfying it. This same word appears in verse 17, where God hears "the desire of the humble" (תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים). The contrast is deliberate: the wicked celebrates *his* desires; God attends to the desires of the lowly.

The second colon contains one of the psalm's most shocking phrases: וּבֹצֵ֥עַ בֵּ֝רֵ֗ךְ נִ֘אֵ֥ץ יְהֹוָֽה. The verb בָּצַע means "to cut off" or "gain by violence"—the participle בֹּצֵעַ denotes the extortioner, the greedy one. But what does בֵּרֵךְ mean here? It's the verb "to bless"!

Rashi resolves this puzzle beautifully: the robber "blesses himself," saying שָׁלוֹם יִהְיֶה לִּי ("peace will be mine")—an echo of Deuteronomy 29:18, where someone imagines escaping consequences. The blessing is self-congratulation while simultaneously scorning (נִאֵץ) the LORD.

The Torah Temimah, a 19th-century commentary connecting verses to rabbinic literature, cites this verse in context of a powerful Talmudic teaching (Bava Kamma 94a): Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says that if someone steals wheat, grinds it, bakes bread, and recites a blessing over it, "he is not blessing but blaspheming—concerning this it is said, 'the greedy one blesses, scorning the LORD.'" Ritual observance built on injustice becomes its own profanity. The verse captures how religious performance can coexist with moral corruption.

**Verse 4**

רָשָׁ֗ע כְּגֹ֣בַהּ אַ֭פּוֹ בַּל־יִדְרֹ֑שׁ; אֵ֥ין אֱ֝לֹהִ֗ים כׇּל־מְזִמּוֹתָֽיו׃

"The wicked, in the height of his nose, does not seek; 'There is no God' is all his schemes."

This verse presents Hebrew readers with an interpretive puzzle. The phrase כְּגֹבַהּ אַפּוֹ literally means "according to the height of his nose/anger." The nose (אַף) in Hebrew is metonymically connected to anger (also אַף) and to the face—think of how we describe someone "looking down their nose" at others. Ibn Ezra notes that the nose is the most prominent feature of the face; when someone is haughty, they literally hold it high.

The verb phrase בַּל־יִדְרֹשׁ ("he does not seek/inquire") introduces the key word דרש that will thread through verses 4, 13, and 15. Here, the wicked doesn't seek God—doesn't inquire of Him, doesn't care about His ways. But the verb also carries the meaning "call to account." The wicked assumes God won't investigate.

The second colon is notoriously difficult: אֵין אֱלֹהִים כׇּל־מְזִמּוֹתָיו. The standard reading takes this as an interior quotation—the wicked's unspoken thought is "There is no God" (אֵין אֱלֹהִים), and this forms the foundation of all his schemes (כׇּל־מְזִמּוֹתָיו). This echoes Psalm 14:1's famous line: "The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God'" (אָמַר נָבָל בְּלִבּוֹ אֵין אֱלֹהִים).

But Ibn Ezra offers an alternative: the phrase might mean "God is not in all his schemes"—that is, God has no place in the wicked's calculations. This captures something important: the wicked isn't necessarily a philosophical atheist. He's a practical atheist who lives as if God doesn't matter, even if he'd nominally affirm God's existence. His schemes proceed without any reference to divine oversight.

The Malbim, a 19th-century commentator who emphasized the precise distinctiveness of Hebrew words, sees this as the first stage of the wicked's deteriorating theology: he starts by denying God's active involvement, and will proceed to deny God's attention entirely.

---

**Verse 5**

יָ֘חִ֤ילוּ דְרָכָ֨ו בְּכׇל־עֵ֗ת; מָר֣וֹם מִ֭שְׁפָּטֶיךָ מִנֶּגְדּ֑וֹ; כׇּל־צ֝וֹרְרָ֗יו יָפִ֥יחַ בָּהֶֽם׃

"His ways prosper at all times; Your judgments are far above him; all his foes—he snorts at them."

Here's the problem that haunts theodicy: the wicked *succeeds*. The verb יָחִילוּ is unusual—it normally means "writhe in pain" (as in childbirth), but here it means "be firm, prosper." Rashi connects it to Job 20:21: "his prosperity will not endure" (לֹא־יָחִיל טוּבוֹ). The irony is sharp: a word associated with anguish describes the wicked's comfortable stability.

The temporal phrase בְּכׇל־עֵת ("at all times") creates painful contrast with verse 1's לְעִתּוֹת בַּצָּרָה ("in times of trouble"). God hides in troubled times; the wicked prospers *at all times*. The disparity screams for explanation.

Then comes spatial theology again: מָרוֹם מִשְׁפָּטֶיךָ מִנֶּגְדּוֹ—"Your judgments are high/far from before him." God's justice operates on a plane so elevated that it doesn't touch the wicked. He can't even see it from where he stands. This is the inverse of Psalm 16:8, where the righteous person says, "I keep the LORD always before me" (שִׁוִּיתִי יְהוָה לְנֶגְדִּי תָמִיד). The righteous keeps God in view; from the wicked's perspective, God's judgments are out of sight.

The final image is contemptuous: יָפִיחַ בָּהֶם ("he snorts/puffs at them"). The verb פוח means to blow or breathe out—the wicked dismisses his enemies with a snort, a puff of air. They collapse at his slightest exhalation. This animalistic disdain links to the predator imagery coming in verses 8-10.

The Talmud (Berakhot 7b) grapples with this verse's troubling implication: Rabbi Yitzchak warns against provoking the wicked while they prosper, citing this verse. Even the sages recognized that empirical reality sometimes contradicts theology—and the psalm refuses to look away from that reality.

---

**Verse 6**

אָמַ֣ר בְּ֭לִבּוֹ בַּל־אֶמּ֑וֹט; לְדֹ֥ר וָ֝דֹ֗ר אֲשֶׁ֣ר לֹֽא־בְרָֽע׃

"He says in his heart, 'I shall not be shaken; through all generations, never in trouble.'"

Here's the first interior monologue, introduced by the formula אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ ("he says in his heart"). In biblical anthropology, the heart isn't the seat of emotion—it's the seat of thought, will, and decision. What someone "says in their heart" is their operating theology, their real beliefs, not necessarily what they'd profess publicly.

The content of this thought is בַּל־אֶמּ֑וֹט ("I shall not be shaken/moved"). This phrase appears throughout Psalms—but usually as a statement of trust in God! In Psalm 16:8, the righteous person declares, "He is at my right hand; I shall not be shaken" (כִּי מִימִינִי בַּל־אֶמּוֹט). In Psalm 62:3, 7, trust in God means "I shall not be greatly shaken." The wicked has stolen the language of faith and applied it to his own stability, but without its foundation—without God.

The temporal expansion לְדֹר וָדֹר ("from generation to generation") makes the claim grandiose. The wicked doesn't just expect to be safe for his lifetime—he projects his security across generations. This echoes how Scripture describes God's faithfulness: "Your faithfulness endures לְדֹר וָדֹר" (Psalm 119:90). The wicked has arrogated to himself the permanence that belongs only to God.

Malbim traces a progression through the three monologues: in verse 6, the wicked asserts personal stability; in verse 11, he'll extend this to a theological claim about God's forgetfulness; in verse 13, he'll make explicit denial. The journey moves from self-confidence through perceived divine absence to practical atheism.

The phrase אֲשֶׁר לֹֽא־בְרָֽע ("who shall never see trouble") forms dark contrast with the "times of trouble" (בַּצָּרָה) in verse 1. The vulnerable cry out in trouble; the wicked is confident he'll never experience it.

---

**Verse 7**

אָלָ֤ה פִּ֣יהוּ מָ֭לֵא וּמִרְמ֣וֹת וָתֹ֑ךְ; תַּ֥חַת לְ֝שׁוֹנ֗וֹ עָמָ֥ל וָאָֽוֶן׃

"His mouth is full of oaths, deceits, and fraud; under his tongue are mischief and iniquity."

The psalm now maps the wicked's anatomy, moving from heart (verse 6) to mouth and tongue. The phrase פִּיהוּ מָלֵא ("his mouth is full") creates an image of overflowing—the wicked doesn't merely speak evil, his speech brims with it. What fills that mouth? Three things: אָלָה (oaths or curses—sworn statements invoking God's name), מִרְמוֹת (deceits), and תֹךְ (fraud, oppression).

The irony of אָלָה is sharp: the wicked swears by God's name while plotting harm. His religious speech is itself a weapon. This explains why verse 3's "the grasping one blesses" could be simultaneously scorning the LORD—false piety masks predation.

The second colon introduces one of Scripture's most vivid anatomical metaphors: תַּחַת לְשׁוֹנוֹ ("under his tongue"). The tongue has an underside, a hidden space where malice lurks. Job 20:12 develops this image: "Though evil is sweet in his mouth, he hides it under his tongue" (יַכְחִידֶנָּה תַּחַת לְשׁוֹנוֹ). The tongue becomes a weapon that stores poison until deployment.

What's hidden there? עָמָל וָאָוֶן ("mischief and iniquity"). This word-pair appears throughout Scripture: עָמָל denotes "toil, trouble, harmful effort," while אָוֶן signifies "wickedness, emptiness, vanity." Together they encompass both the labor and the futility of evil scheming—the wicked works hard at worthlessness.

Radak captures the verse's dynamic: "When he swears with the tongue, under the tongue in the heart there is mischief and iniquity"—outward oath contradicts inner malice. Public speech conceals private corruption.

---

**Verse 8**

יֵשֵׁ֤ב בְּמַאְרַ֬ב חֲצֵרִ֗ים; בַּֽ֭מִּסְתָּרִים יַהֲרֹ֣ג נָקִ֑י; עֵ֝ינָ֗יו לְֽחֵלְכָ֥ה יִצְפֹּֽנוּ׃

"He sits in ambush in villages; in secret places he slays the innocent; his eyes spy on the helpless."

Now the predator imagery fully emerges. The verb יֵשֵׁב ("sits") creates deliberate counterpoint to verse 1's תַּעֲמֹד ("stands"). Where God "stands" at a distance (passively), the wicked "sits" in ambush (actively). Divine inaction enables human predation.

The phrase בְּמַאְרַב חֲצֵרִים literally means "in ambush of courtyards/villages"—the unwalled settlements where people gather, the public squares that become hunting grounds. Rashi identifies these as outer courtyards where the wicked blends into crowds. The second colon adds בַּמִּסְתָּרִים ("in secret places")—the wicked operates both openly and covertly, saturating all spaces.

The verb יַהֲרֹג ("he kills") escalates from exploitation to murder. Its object, נָקִי ("innocent, blameless"), carries legal weight. The phrase "innocent blood" (דָּם נָקִי) appears in Deuteronomy 19:13 regarding murder that cries out for justice. This isn't conflict among equals—it's slaughter of the guiltless.

The final colon is chilling: עֵינָיו לְחֵלְכָה יִצְפֹּנוּ ("his eyes spy on/lie in wait for the helpless"). The term חֵלְכָה (appearing also in verses 10, 14) denotes the vulnerable, perhaps from a root meaning "weak." Rashi interprets the suffix as addressing God: "to You, Your helpless ones"—the victims belong to God even as the predator stalks them.

The watching eyes reverse divine oversight. In verse 1, God "hides" (תַּעְלִים); here, the wicked's eyes are constantly surveilling. Where God's gaze withdraws, other predators fill the vacuum. This is the psalm's dark ecology: divine absence creates hunting space.

---

**Verse 9**

יֶאֱרֹ֬ב בַּמִּסְתָּ֨ר כְּאַרְיֵ֬ה בְסֻכֹּ֗ה; יֶ֭אֱרֹב לַחֲט֣וֹף עָנִ֑י; יַחְטֹ֥ף עָ֝נִ֗י בְּמׇשְׁכ֥וֹ בְרִשְׁתּֽוֹ׃

"He lurks in secret like a lion in his lair; he lurks to seize the poor; he seizes the poor, dragging him in his net."

The simile becomes explicit: כְּאַרְיֵה בְסֻכֹּה ("like a lion in his lair"). The noun סֻכָּה usually means "booth" (as in Sukkot), but here denotes the lion's thicket—a place of concealment before attack. The comparison draws on Ancient Near Eastern imagery of the lion as apex predator, patient and deadly.

Notice the tricolon structure (three-part line) with hammering repetition: יֶאֱרֹב... יֶאֱרֹב... יַחְטֹף ("he lurks... he lurks... he seizes"). The verb ארב ("ambush") repeats twice before the climactic יַחְטֹף ("seize, snatch"). Then חטף itself repeats: "he seizes the poor; he seizes the poor by dragging him in his net."

Wait—net? Didn't we just have a lion? The metaphor shifts without warning: the wicked is both lion (raw predatory power) and net-hunter (calculated trapping). Some commentators find this awkward, but the mixing compounds threat. The wicked attacks through both brute force and cunning technology.

The word עָנִי ("poor, afflicted") appears twice, emphasizing the target. This is the same term from verse 2—the psalm hammers home who suffers. The phrase בְּמׇשְׁכוֹ בְרִשְׁתּוֹ ("by his dragging in his net") combines the infinitive of משׁך ("draw, drag") with "net" (רֶשֶׁת). The victim is already caught and being pulled away—there's no escape.

Interestingly, Psalm 7:16 and 9:16 also use pit/net imagery for self-inflicted justice: "The nations have sunk in the pit they made; their foot was caught in the net they hid" (טָבְעוּ גוֹיִם בְּשַׁחַת עָשׂוּ בְּרֶשֶׁת זוּ טָמָנוּ נִלְכְּדָה רַגְלָם). The psalmist hopes for such reversal in verse 2.

**Verse 10**

יִדְכֶּ֥ה יָשֹׁ֑חַ; וְנָפַ֥ל בַּ֝עֲצוּמָ֗יו חֵ֣ל כָּאִֽים׃

"He crouches, he bows down; and the helpless fall by his might."

This verse has significant textual difficulties—the Hebrew manuscript tradition (what scholars call Ketiv/Qere, meaning "what's written" versus "what's read") shows variants, and the final word appears broken in transmission. But the meaning is clear enough: the predator crouches before springing, and victims collapse.

The verbs יִדְכֶּה יָשֹׁחַ ("he crouches, he bows down") continue the lion imagery—a great cat lowering itself before the strike. Both verbs suggest bringing oneself low: דכה relates to "crush, be crushed" while שחח means "bow, be bowed." The predator diminishes his profile.

Ibn Ezra notes this describes the lion's method: it doesn't announce itself but crouches so as not to be noticed, then springs on prey. The deceptive lowering precedes deadly attack.

The second colon describes the result: וְנָפַל ("and [the prey] falls"). Who falls? The phrase בַּעֲצוּמָיו is ambiguous—it could mean "by his mighty ones" (the wicked's accomplices), "by his mighty [limbs/claws]" (continuing animal imagery), or "by his power" (abstractly). What falls is חֵל כָּאִים, which the Masoretic tradition splits into two words: "host of the afflicted." The helpless collapse under the predator's strength.

The verse completes the hunt cycle: ambush (v. 8) → lurking (v. 9) → strike (v. 10). The wicked has achieved his goal. The helpless lie fallen. And this brings us to the second interior monologue.

**Verse 11**

אָמַ֣ר בְּ֭לִבּוֹ שָׁ֣כַֽח אֵ֑ל; הִסְתִּ֥יר פָּ֝נָ֗יו בַּל־רָאָ֥ה לָנֶֽצַח׃

"He says in his heart, 'God has forgotten; He has hidden His face; He never looks.'"

The second אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ ("he says in his heart") comes after successful predation. Having crushed his victims unchallenged, the wicked draws theological conclusions. Notice the three-part structure, each clause escalating the claim:

1. שָׁכַח אֵל ("God has forgotten") — God once knew but no longer remembers
2. הִסְתִּיר פָּנָיו ("He has hidden His face") — God has actively withdrawn
3. בַּל־רָאָה לָנֶצַח ("He never looks") — God doesn't see and never will

This creates a temporal spectrum: past (forgotten), present (hidden face), and future (never). The wicked's theology covers all bases.

Here's the psalm's central irony: this is almost exactly what the psalmist complained about in verse 1! The psalmist asked "Why do You hide?" (תַּעְלִים); the wicked concludes "He has hidden His face" (הִסְתִּיר פָּנָיו). Both perceive divine absence. But where the psalmist protests, the wicked celebrates. Where complaint becomes petition, complacency becomes exploitation.

The phrase הִסְתִּיר פָּנָיו ("He has hidden His face") is standard biblical vocabulary for divine withdrawal. It appears in the covenant curses of Deuteronomy 31:17-18, and in psalms of lament like 44:25 ("Why do You hide Your face, forget our affliction?"). The wicked has learned the language of covenant but drawn the opposite conclusion—if God hides, anything goes.

The Malbim sees progression: in verse 6, the wicked claimed personal invulnerability; now he provides the theological justification. His success proves God isn't watching. Empirical prosperity becomes evidence for practical atheism.

**Verse 12**

קוּמָ֤ה יְהֹוָ֗ה אֵ֭ל נְשָׂ֣א יָדֶ֑ךָ; אַל־תִּשְׁכַּ֥ח עֲנָוִֽים׃

"Arise, O LORD! O God, lift up Your hand! Do not forget the lowly."

The psalm pivots dramatically. After eleven verses of complaint and description, three imperatives burst forth: קוּמָה ("Arise!"), נְשָׂא ("Lift up!"), אַל־תִּשְׁכַּח ("Do not forget!").

The cry קוּמָה יְהֹוָה ("Arise, O LORD!") appears at crisis moments throughout the Psalter. In Psalm 3:8, it precedes a plea for deliverance; in Psalm 7:7, it summons God's anger against enemies; in Psalm 9:20, it introduces petition for judgment on the nations. The verb קום ("arise") implies God has been sitting or resting—it calls Him from passivity to action.

The double divine naming—יְהֹוָה (the personal covenant name, traditionally not pronounced) then אֵל (the generic divine title)—creates solemn invocation. The psalmist summons both God's covenant loyalty and His power.

"Lift up Your hand" (נְשָׂא יָדֶךָ) is the idiom for raised hand as power-display or oath-gesture. When God "lifts His hand," He's preparing to strike. Rashi glosses this as "show Your strength" (להראות כֹּחֲךָ). The petition directly counters verse 5, where God's judgments seemed "far removed."

The final phrase creates pointed verbal linkage: אַל־תִּשְׁכַּח ("do not forget") echoes the wicked's שָׁכַח אֵל ("God has forgotten") in verse 11. The same verb in opposite forms—the wicked's assertion becomes the psalmist's prohibition. This is the psalm's theological wager: will God prove the wicked wrong by remembering?

The object of this remembering is עֲנָוִים (the Qere/read form; the Ketiv/written form is עֲנִיִּים). Both mean "the lowly/poor/humble." These are the people the wicked hunts, the ones God must not forget.

**Verse 13**

עַל־מֶ֤ה נִאֵ֖ץ רָשָׁ֥ע אֱלֹהִ֑ים; אָמַ֥ר בְּ֝לִבּ֗וֹ לֹ֣א תִדְרֹֽשׁ׃

"Why should the wicked scorn God, thinking, 'You do not call to account'?"

A second rhetorical question appears: עַל־מֶה ("on what basis? why?"). This isn't the same as verse 1's לָמָה—it carries more astonishment: *On what grounds* does the wicked dare scorn God?

The verb נִאֵץ ("scorn, revile, blaspheme") reappears from verse 3. It's theologically explosive vocabulary—appearing in contexts of existential threat to covenant relationship (Numbers 14:11, 23; 2 Samuel 12:14). To "scorn" God is to treat His judgments as negligible, His commands as irrelevant.

Then comes the third and final interior monologue: אָמַר בְּלִבּוֹ לֹא תִדְרֹשׁ ("he says in his heart, 'You do not call to account'"). The verb דרש returns from verse 4, but now with God as implied subject and the wicked as speaker. The wicked addresses God directly (second person "You"), denying that God investigates or demands account.

The three דרש appearances create powerful wordplay:
- Verse 4: בַּל־יִדְרֹשׁ ("he [the wicked] does not seek [God]")
- Verse 13: לֹא תִדְרֹשׁ ("You [God] do not seek [justice/account]")
- Verse 15: תִּדְרוֹשׁ־רִשְׁעוֹ ("You will seek his wickedness")

The wicked's confident denial will become the psalmist's urgent petition. The same word pivots from statement of disbelief to prayer for justice.

The Malbim notes this is the climax of the wicked's theological deterioration: he began denying God's active involvement (v. 4), progressed to claiming God doesn't see (v. 11), and now explicitly asserts God won't demand account (v. 13). Practical atheism complete.

**Verse 14**

רָאִ֡תָה כִּי־אַתָּ֤ה עָ֘מָ֤ל וָכַ֨עַס תַּבִּיט֮; לָתֵ֢ת בְּיָ֫דֶ֥ךָ; עָ֭לֶיךָ יַעֲזֹ֣ב חֵלֵ֑כָה; יָ֝ת֗וֹם אַתָּ֤ה הָיִ֬יתָ עוֹזֵֽר׃

"You DO see! For You behold mischief and vexation, to take them in hand. Upon You the helpless entrusts himself; You have been the orphan's helper."

This is the psalm's theological turning point. The emphatic fronted verb רָאִתָה ("You have seen" / "You DO see") directly contradicts everything the wicked claimed. Where verse 11 asserted בַּל־רָאָה ("He never looks"), verse 14 counters with "You have looked, You DO see."

The grammatical form matters: רָאִתָה is perfect tense (indicating completed action), placed first in the sentence for maximum emphasis. This isn't hoping God will eventually see—it's asserting God has seen, does see, is seeing right now. Scholars call this the "perfect of conviction"—grammatically past but asserting present reality with certainty.

The explanatory כִּי ("for") introduces evidence: אַתָּה עָמָל וָכַעַס תַּבִּיט ("You behold mischief and vexation"). The pronoun אַתָּה ("You") is redundant—the verb already indicates second person—but adds emphasis: "*You*—You specifically—behold..." The nouns עָמָל וָכַעַס ("mischief and vexation/grief") recall verse 7's עָמָל וָאָוֶן ("mischief and iniquity"). What the wicked hid under his tongue, God observes openly.

The phrase לָתֵת בְּיָדֶךָ ("to give/place in Your hand") means God takes matters in hand—He assumes responsibility for addressing injustice. Rashi reads this as promise of recompense: "to give him his recompense."

The verse pivots to the victims: עָלֶיךָ יַעֲזֹב חֵלֵכָה ("upon You the helpless entrusts himself"). The verb עזב here doesn't mean "abandon" (its usual sense) but "leave, entrust, commit"—like Psalm 37:5: "Commit your way to the LORD." The helpless has no other recourse; he leaves his case with God.

Finally, the orphan appears: יָתוֹם אַתָּה הָיִיתָ עוֹזֵר ("the orphan—You have been his helper"). The orphan represents the paradigmatic defenseless person in Torah—fatherless, without legal advocate, without inheritance. Torah repeatedly commands protecting orphans (Exodus 22:21-23; Deuteronomy 10:18). The perfect tense ("You have been") appeals to God's track record: You've done this before; do it again.

**Verse 15**

שְׁ֭בֹר זְר֣וֹעַ רָשָׁ֑ע; וָ֝רָ֗ע תִּֽדְרוֹשׁ־רִשְׁע֥וֹ בַל־תִּמְצָֽא׃

"Break the arm of the wicked! As for the evil one—seek his wickedness until You find none."

The petition turns violent: שְׁבֹר זְרוֹעַ רָשָׁע ("break the arm of the wicked"). The "arm" (זְרוֹעַ) represents strength and capacity to act—the "strong arm" is standard biblical idiom for power, whether divine (Exodus 6:6, the "outstretched arm") or human. To break someone's arm is to disable their ability to harm. Psalm 37:17 uses nearly identical language: "the arms of the wicked will be broken" (זְרוֹעוֹת רְשָׁעִים תִּשָּׁבַרְנָה).

This isn't asking for the wicked's repentance—it's asking for his dismantling. The imprecatory tradition in Psalms prays for destruction of enemies as prayers for the end of injustice. The ethical assumption is that wickedness has become so integral to this person's identity that reform is impossible; only removal of power works.

The second colon completes the דרש wordplay: תִּדְרוֹשׁ־רִשְׁעוֹ ("seek his wickedness"). In verse 4, the wicked didn't seek God; in verse 13, he claimed God doesn't seek accountability. Now the psalmist commands: "Seek! Investigate! Call to account!" The same verb—denied by the wicked, demanded by the faithful.

The phrase בַל־תִּמְצָא ("until You find none") suggests thorough prosecution: seek his wickedness exhaustively, until nothing remains to find. Radak explains: "If You break his arm... You will not find wickedness in the land"—disable the oppressor, and evil itself diminishes.

The Torah Temimah cites this verse in connection with the Talmud's discussion (Berakhot 7a, Megillah 17b) of the Amidah's ninth blessing, which prays against oppressive powers. The rabbinic tradition reads "break the arm of the wicked" not as personal vengeance but as prayer for the dismantling of systemic oppression—structures of power that crush the vulnerable.

**Verse 16**

יְהֹוָ֣ה מֶ֭לֶךְ עוֹלָ֣ם וָעֶ֑ד; אָבְד֥וּ ג֝וֹיִ֗ם מֵאַרְצֽוֹ׃

"The LORD is king forever and ever; the nations have perished from His land."

The genre shifts abruptly. After complaint, description, and petition, the psalmist suddenly *declares*. This isn't argument—it's proclamation. The phrase יְהֹוָה מֶלֶךְ ("the LORD is king") echoes throughout the Psalter's enthronement psalms (93:1, 96:10, 97:1, 99:1), which celebrate God's cosmic sovereignty over creation and nations.

The temporal phrase עוֹלָם וָעֶד ("forever and ever") stands in deliberate contrast to the wicked's boast in verse 6: לְדֹר וָדֹר ("through all generations"). The wicked claimed his own permanence; the psalmist now asserts God's true eternality.

The second colon is striking: אָבְדוּ גוֹיִם מֵאַרְצוֹ ("the nations have perished from His land"). The verb אָבְדוּ is grammatically past tense—"have perished"—but the nations haven't actually perished yet. This is what grammarians call "prophetic perfect"—using completed-action grammar for future events viewed as so certain they're described as already accomplished. The psalmist's confidence collapses future judgment into present reality.

Why suddenly "nations" (גוֹיִם) when the psalm has described an individual wicked person? Several possibilities: the individual oppressor represents foreign powers; "nations" functions as shorthand for "the wicked collectively" (as in Psalms 9:6, 16); or the psalm's original context was communal lament against national enemies.

The liturgical significance of this verse is substantial. In Sefardic and Mizrachi morning services, it appears in *Yehi Khvod*, positioned immediately after the threefold declaration יְהֹוָה מֶלֶךְ, יְהֹוָה מָלָךְ, יְהֹוָה יִמְלֹךְ לְעוֹלָם וָעֶד ("The LORD is King, the LORD was King, the LORD will be King forever"). Our verse becomes the capstone: God's eternal reign proves itself through the elimination of opposing powers.

**Verse 17**

תַּאֲוַ֬ת עֲנָוִ֣ים שָׁמַ֣עְתָּ יְהֹוָ֑ה; תָּכִ֥ין לִ֝בָּ֗ם תַּקְשִׁ֥יב אׇזְנֶֽךָ׃

"The desire of the humble You have heard, O LORD; You will establish their heart, You will incline Your ear."

The word תַּאֲוָה ("desire, longing") appeared in verse 3 describing the wicked's appetite (תַּאֲוַת נַפְשׁוֹ, "his soul's desire"). Here it describes the humble's yearning (תַּאֲוַת עֲנָוִים). The contrast is pointed: the wicked boasts about achieving his desires; God *hears* the desires of the lowly.

The verb שָׁמַעְתָּ ("You have heard") is another perfect tense—not "You will hear" but "You have heard." Like verse 14's רָאִתָה, this asserts accomplished reality. Divine hearing, in biblical idiom, initiates redemption. When Exodus 2:24 says God "heard" Israel's groaning (וַיִּשְׁמַע אֱלֹהִים אֶת־נַאֲקָתָם), the exodus begins. To say "You have heard" is to claim that deliverance has commenced.

The second colon shifts to future/imperfect verbs: תָּכִין... תַּקְשִׁיב ("You will establish... You will incline"). The verb כון (hiphil: "establish, make firm, prepare") suggests God strengthens the humble internally—their hearts gain resolve for prayer. Radak reads this beautifully: "You will remove from their hearts the anxiety of the world"—God prepares them to pray with proper focus.

The phrase תַּקְשִׁיב אׇזְנֶךָ ("You will incline Your ear") is common biblical idiom for attentive listening. The image is anthropomorphic—God bends closer to hear better, like a parent leaning down to a child's whisper. This counters verse 1's spatial distance: even if God seems far, His ear inclines toward the humble.

This verse appears prominently in High Holiday liturgy. During the chazan's repetition of the Amidah, the prayer leader declares his unworthiness and then pleads: תָּכִין לִבָּם תַּקְשִׁיב אָזְנֶךָ ("Prepare their heart; incline Your ear"). The verse becomes a meditation on prayer's dependence on divine grace—we can't pray properly without God enabling it.

**Verse 18**

לִשְׁפֹּ֥ט יָת֗וֹם וָ֫דָ֥ךְ; בַּל־יוֹסִ֥יף ע֑וֹד לַעֲרֹ֥ץ אֱ֝נ֗וֹשׁ מִן־הָאָֽרֶץ׃

"To champion the orphan and the downtrodden; that men of the earth tyrannize no more."

The infinitive לִשְׁפֹּט ("to judge, to champion") articulates the purpose of God's attentive hearing. The Hebrew verb שָׁפַט doesn't mean "judge" in the neutral sense of adjudicating between parties. When applied to the powerless, it means "vindicate, champion, secure justice for." Deuteronomy 10:18 captures this: God "executes justice for the orphan and widow" (עֹשֶׂה מִשְׁפַּט יָתוֹם וְאַלְמָנָה). The judge isn't neutral—he's the orphan's advocate.

The pair יָתוֹם וָדָךְ ("orphan and downtrodden") represents covenant categories. The orphan appeared in verse 14; now joined by דָּךְ (from דכא, "to crush")—those ground down by oppression, whose spirits have been broken. Together they're the bottom of the social hierarchy, those without advocates or inheritance.

The second colon envisions cessation: בַּל־יוֹסִ֥יף עוֹד לַעֲרֹץ ("he will no longer continue to terrify"). The double negative בַּל־יוֹסִ֥יף עוֹד emphasizes finality. The verb ערץ ("terrify, strike with terror") appears in contexts of fear before overwhelming power (Deuteronomy 1:29, 7:21). Here the subject is אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָרֶץ ("man of/from the earth").

This phrase makes the psalm's final theological statement. The noun אֱנוֹשׁ emphasizes human frailty and mortality—it's used when contrasting human weakness with divine power (Psalm 8:5, 90:3, 103:15). Adding מִן־הָאָרֶץ ("from the earth") doubles down: this tyrant is earthly, mortal, made of dust and returning to dust. The phrase stands in deliberate contrast to verse 16's declaration that God is king עוֹלָם וָעֶד ("forever and ever"). God is eternal king; man is of the earth.

Ibn Ezra captures the implication: אֱנוֹשׁ מִן־הָאָרֶץ emphasizes that humans are earthborn and will return to earth—they have no inherent right to terrorize others because they themselves are temporary and fragile.

The psalm ends not with resolution—the wicked hasn't yet been destroyed, God's hiddenness hasn't been explained—but with vision. The broken acrostic remains broken. But the psalm argues that even incomplete alphabets can spell justice, and even distant kings can hear the cry of the afflicted. The question "Why do You stand aloof?" (v. 1) transforms into the affirmation "The LORD is king forever" (v. 16). This is theodicy through doxology—suffering acknowledged, wickedness anatomized, divine sovereignty proclaimed.
