### EDITORIAL ASSESSMENT

What works: The draft rightly locates Psalm 117’s paradox—calling all nations to praise on the basis of God’s covenant fidelity to Israel—and traces it through the psalm’s compact structure. The treatment of gavar (“prevailed”) is strong, noticing the personification of hesed and citing Psalm 103:11. The link to Exodus 34:6 and the recurring pair hesed/’emet is accurate. The liturgical anchoring (Hallel; Mizrahi use before Baruch She’amar) is helpful. The essay also uses reception history well (Ibn Ezra, Radak; Paul’s citation in Romans 15:11).

What needs work: 
- Tone and framing: “missionary theology” is anachronistic for a Hebrew psalm; prefer “election for the sake of revelation.” 
- Missed intertextual opportunities: Psalm 117 sits inside a web of Hallel echoes. Psalm 115:1 (“for the sake of Your hesed and Your ’emet”) stands only a page away and should be brought into view; so should Psalm 100’s final line and Psalm 146’s “keeps faith forever.” 
- Overuse of phonetic transcription: the prosodic analysis leans on stress patterns that are not crucial here; keep sound-play comments, but use transliteration only when it serves a clear point.
- The LXX: note more clearly that the Greek uses a verb meaning “to make mighty/confirm” (κραταιόω), nudging readers toward the sense of “decisive, victorious mercy.” 
- The preposition ’al (“upon/over/toward”): the draft mentions it, but should reinforce the beneficent sense with Psalm 33:22; 90:17.
- ANE parallels: briefly register that summoning other nations to praise a god is uncommon outside Israel’s monotheistic frame; within the Psalter compare Psalms 67; 96–98. 
- Liturgical section: good begins, but it needs clearer structure, Hebrew quotations from the prayers, and sharper theological payoff (“how the community reads the psalm by using it this way”).

Figurative language: The personification of hesed as a prevailing force could be sharpened with concrete biblical parallels (Gen 7:18’s “the waters prevailed”) and contrasted with more common abundance verbs (rav, rabah). Patterns and frequency are noticed but not pressed into a distinctive reading of this psalm’s choice of gavar.

Bottom line: tighten terminology, highlight the Hallel intertextual web, right-size the sound analysis, expand ANE and LXX notes, and strengthen the liturgical section with quotations and interpretation.

### REVISED INTRODUCTION

Seventeen Hebrew words, two verses, and a bold claim: the peoples of the earth should praise Israel’s God because His steadfast love has “prevailed over us.” Psalm 117 is tiny by design. It does not rehearse creation or the moral order; it does not list reasons in a swelling catalogue. Instead, it compresses a theology of election and universality into an epigram. The nations (goyim) and peoples (’ummim) are summoned to praise—before any reason is given. Only then does the psalm supply the motive: “For His hesed has prevailed upon us, and the faithfulness of YHWH endures forever.”

The shape is classical hymn: summons to praise, followed by motivation, sealed with Hallelujah. Hebrew poetry typically works through parallelism, a pairing of lines (cola) in which the second line restates, intensifies, or completes the first. Verse 1 asks for universal praise twice—“Praise… all nations; extol Him, all peoples”—a form of synonymous parallelism that doubles the audience (goyim/’ummim) and the act (hallelu/shabbehu). The repeated kol (“all”) at the beginnings is anaphora (repeated word at line openings), creating a drumbeat of inclusion.

But verse 2 springs the paradox. The reason the nations should praise is not a general benefit but Israel’s particular story: “For (ki) His hesed has gavar ‘alenu.” The verb gavar means “to prevail, be mighty, overcome.” It often carries a martial or competitive edge: “the waters prevailed” in the Flood (Genesis 7:18–20); “for as high as the heavens over the earth, so has His hesed prevailed over those who fear Him” (Psalm 103:11). Here, hesed—God’s covenant loyalty—acts like a conquering force that “overwhelms” Israel. The preposition ’al (“over/upon/toward”) can imply dominance or beneficence. The Psalter shades it toward blessing: “May Your hesed, O YHWH, be upon us (’alenu)” (Psalm 33:22); “May the favor (no‘am) of the Lord our God be upon us (’alenu)” (Psalm 90:17). Psalm 117 seems to hold both senses together with a thumb on the side of mercy—God’s love has not merely been abundant; it has proven stronger than counterforces.

The pair “hesed and ’emet” (steadfast love and faithfulness) echoes the divine self-declaration at Sinai: “abounding in hesed and ’emet” (Exodus 34:6). The Psalter reworks that pair across its length. Strikingly, Psalm 115:1—only two psalms earlier in Hallel—prays, “Not to us, O YHWH… but to Your name give glory, because of Your hesed, because of Your ’emet” (עַל־חַסְדְּךָ עַל־אֲמִתֶּךָ). Psalm 117 transposes the pair into a compressed timeline: hesed is told as accomplished victory (“has prevailed”), while ’emet is projected without horizon (“the faithfulness of YHWH is forever”). Past rescue becomes the warrant for future reliability. The Greek translators (the Septuagint, or LXX) render gavar with a verb meaning “to make mighty/confirm” (κραταιόω), nudging the line toward “He has powerfully confirmed His mercy upon us”—a nuance that preserves the sense of decisive triumph.

Why address the nations at all? Israel’s poets were not shy about summoning creation to praise (Psalms 96–98; 148), but calling foreign peoples to acclaim Israel’s God for Israel’s sake is rarer and depends on Israel’s monotheistic claim: the God who bound Himself to this people is, in fact, the God of all. Medieval commentators offer different angles. Ibn Ezra, ever concise, reads the nations as those “under David’s hand,” who saw YHWH’s fidelity to Israel and were compelled to acknowledge it. Radak widens the lens to the messianic future when the nations will recognize God’s sovereignty through Israel’s redemption. Malbim imagines concrete historical ripples: when YHWH rescued Israel, surrounding nations benefited and thus had their own reasons to praise. A later reader, Paul, cites Psalm 117:1 in Romans 15:11 among a chain of texts to argue for the inclusion of Gentiles in praise of Israel’s God; whether or not one shares his christological conclusion, his hermeneutical instinct is close to the psalm’s: Israel’s particular deliverance is evidence for a universal truth.

Psalm 117’s brevity is not an accident of composition; it is a strategy. It functions like a liturgical refrain in the Egyptian Hallel (Psalms 113–118), the festival collection for Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot. Hallel begins with God’s raising of the lowly (Psalm 113), moves through thanksgiving for rescue (Psalms 114–116), and culminates in national acclamation (Psalm 118). Set just before that climax, Psalm 117 crystallizes the logic of the whole: God’s steadfast love toward Israel, proven in history, discloses who God is—for everyone. The closing “Hallelujah” (הַלְלוּ־יָהּ) forms an inclusio (a frame with repeated words at the beginning and end) with the psalm’s opening “Praise,” and the shortened divine name Yah, found both in early poetry (Exodus 15:2) and in late Hallel formulae, lends an air of liturgical intimacy.

A final word on terms. Parallelism is the basic engine of Hebrew verse: one line paired with a second that restates, sharpens, or completes it. Anaphora is beginning successive lines with the same word. Inclusio brackets a unit with repeated words or ideas. The “perfect” verb tense in biblical Hebrew often views an action as complete; here, “has prevailed” presents hesed as a finished triumph. These simple pieces serve a sparse, forceful theology: election serves revelation. YHWH’s fidelity to Israel is not a private possession but a public proof.

#### Full psalm

Psalm 117 is recited in full as part of Hallel (Psalms 113–118) at Shacharit on festivals (Pesach, Shavuot, Sukkot), Chanukah, and Rosh Chodesh. At the Passover Seder, it appears in the second half of Hallel before the fourth cup. Its position between Psalms 116 and 118 turns it into a hinge: the individual’s thanksgiving (116) gives way to a universal summons (117) and then to Israel’s national acclamation (118).

#### Phrases

כִּ֥י־גָ֘בַ֤ר עָלֵ֨ינוּ ׀ חַסְדּ֗וֹ וֶאֱמֶת־יְהֹוָ֥ה לְעוֹלָ֗ם (“For His mercy has prevailed over us, and the faithfulness of YHWH endures forever,” 117:2). In Edot HaMizrach, this line is said as an optional opening before Baruch She’amar on Shabbat, Rosh Hashanah, and Yom Kippur: יש אומרים: כִּי גָבַר עָלֵינוּ חַסְדּוֹ וֶאֱמֶת יְ־הוָה לְעוֹלָם הַלְלוּיָהּ; בָּרוּךְ שֶׁנָּתַן לְעַמּוֹ יִשְׂרָאֵל… (“Some say: For His mercy has prevailed over us… Hallelujah; Blessed is He who gave to His people Israel…”). The line becomes a threshold confession: before the praise section begins, the congregation names God’s prevailing mercy as the premise of worship.

עָלֵינוּ חַסְדּוֹ (“His mercy is upon us,” 117:2). In Sefard communities this phrase is embedded in Simchat Torah Hakafot and in Shabbat zemirot: מִכָּל אוֹם גָּבַר עָלֵינוּ חַסְדּוֹ (“Over every nation His mercy has prevailed upon us”). The abbreviated quotation heightens the psalm’s central claim—divine mercy “upon us”—and reads it as covenantal constancy celebrated in dance and at table.

וֶאֱמֶת־יְהֹוָה לְעוֹלָם (“the faithfulness of YHWH is forever,” 117:2). Ashkenazi High Holiday piyyutim sometimes weave this clause into the Kedushah of the Amidah on Yom Kippur Shacharit (e.g., “מֶלֶךְ וֶאֱמֶת יְהוָה לְעוֹלָם הַלְלוּיָהּ” – “King—and the faithfulness of YHWH is forever—Hallelujah”), a liturgical flourish that turns the psalm’s conclusion into an affirmation of God’s unchanging sovereignty at the day’s holiest moment.

These uses show how tradition “hears” Psalm 117: as a compact credo that inaugurates praise (“His mercy has prevailed”), fuels celebration (“His mercy is upon us”), and anchors awe (“His faithfulness is forever”).

### REVISED VERSE COMMENTARY

**Verse 1**

“הַֽלְל֣וּ אֶת־יְהוָה כׇּל־גּוֹיִם; שַׁבְּח֗וּהוּ כׇּל־הָאֻמִּֽים.”  
“Praise YHWH, all nations; extol Him, all peoples.”

The psalm begins with a double imperative—הַלְלוּ (“praise”) and שַׁבְּחוּהוּ (“extol him”)—that exemplifies synonymous parallelism, where the second colon restates and intensifies the first. The two addressees, “nations” (גּוֹיִם) and “peoples” (אֻמִּים), are likewise paired terms. BDB notes that le’om/’ummim is a poetic word for people-group that frequently stands in parallel with goy/goyim (cf. Psalm 2:1: “לָמָּה רָגְשׁוּ גוֹיִם… וּלְאֻמִּים יֶהְגּוּ רִיק,” “Why do the nations rage… and the peoples mutter vain things?”). The effect is a merism of humanity’s public life—the political (“nations”) and the kin-cultural (“peoples”)—claiming the whole. The anaphora of כׇּל (“all”) at the head of each colon hammers the point.

The verbs sharpen the register. הִלֵּל is the Psalter’s ordinary verb for liturgical praise; שִׁבֵּחַ, a late (Aramaic-tinged) verb, often means “to laud/commend” in a formal sense (BDB s.v. שׁבח²). The second colon thus “steps up” the call: not only common praise but public commendation is required. The line fits the hymnic pattern: a summons first, reasons later. It is also a rhetorical gambit. The psalmist commands the world before explaining why it should listen.

The address to the nations has analogues within the Psalms (e.g., Psalm 67; 96–98; 100). It is relatively unusual in ancient Near Eastern hymnody, where deities are often national patrons; here Israel’s poet presumes a universal claim. Set within Hallel, the summons resonates with Psalm 115’s open challenge to the nations—“לָמָּה יֹאמְרוּ הַגּוֹיִם: אַיֵּה־נָא אֱלֹהֵיהֶם?” (“Why should the nations say, ‘Where is now their God?’,” 115:2)—and Psalm 118’s worldwide triumph. The call is either anticipatory (the eschatological acknowledgement Radak describes), evidentiary (the witnesses Ibn Ezra imagines), or both.

Reception is instructive. Paul cites “Praise the Lord, all you nations” in Romans 15:11 as one bead in a chain (Deut 32:43; Ps 18:49; Ps 117:1; Isa 11:10) to argue that Israel’s Scriptures foresee Gentile praise. His hermeneutic depends on the psalm’s own logic: the summons is not parochial but genuinely universal. Jewish liturgy keeps the line at the center of festival celebration; recited by Israel, the call to the nations has the texture of vocation—Israel exists so that this praise will happen.

Formally, this verse is terse (only five words per colon in Hebrew) and balanced. The two cola mirror each other in syntax: imperative + object + addressee; imperative + pronominal suffix + addressee. That syntactic parallelism creates the “rhythm of thought” that biblical poetry favors. Sound-play is present but not programmatic; what drives the line is the semantic symmetry and the boldness of its horizon: “all… all.”

**Verse 2**

“כִּ֥י־גָ֘בַ֤ר עָלֵ֨ינוּ ׀ חַסְדּ֗וֹ; וֶאֱמֶת־יְהוָ֥ה לְעוֹלָ֗ם. הַֽלְלוּ־יָֽהּ.”  
“For His steadfast love has prevailed upon us; and the faithfulness of YHWH is forever. Hallelujah.”

The ki (“for”) now supplies what the first verse withheld: the reason for universal praise. The shock is deliberate: the “because” is not cosmic order or general providence, but Israel’s particular experience—“upon us” (עָלֵינוּ). The theological work is done by a verb and a pair. The verb is גָבַר (gavar), “to be strong, prevail,” a word used for winning struggles and overcoming resistance. Floodwaters “prevailed” (וַיִּגְבְּרוּ) over the earth (Genesis 7:18–20); lifting Moses’ hands made “Israel prevail” (כִּי־גָבַר יִשְׂרָאֵל, Exodus 17:11). In the Psalter the only other instance of hesed as the subject of gavar is Psalm 103:11: “גָּבַר חַסְדּוֹ עַל־יִרְאֵיו” (“His steadfast love has prevailed over those who fear Him”). The psalmist chooses gavar instead of common abundance verbs (רַב/רָבָה), personifying hesed as a force that wins. The preposition עַל can suggest dominance (“over”) or beneficent covering (“upon, toward”). Elsewhere it marks blessing: “יְהִי־חַסְדְּךָ יְהוָה עָלֵינוּ” (“May Your hesed be upon us,” Psalm 33:22); “וִיהִי נֹעַם… עָלֵינוּ” (“May the favor… be upon us,” Psalm 90:17). Here it likely carries both, but the idiom of blessing leans the line toward “has overwhelmed us for good.”

Next comes the covenant pair: hesed and ’emet. From Exodus 34:6 onward, “abounding in hesed and ’emet” is a shorthand for God’s covenant character. The pair saturates the Psalms (25:10; 40:11; 57:3; 61:7; 86:15; 89:14), and in Hallel specifically it frames the theology: “Not to us… for the sake of Your hesed, for the sake of Your ’emet” (115:1). Psalm 117 splits the pair across time: hesed as a decisive past act (“has prevailed”), ’emet as open-ended reliability (“forever”). The LXX’s choice of a verb meaning “to make mighty/confirm” (κραταιόω) fits this rhetorical arc: Israel’s experience confirms God’s character; God’s character guarantees the future.

The logic that puzzled readers—why should Gentiles praise YHWH for what He did for Israel?—is clarified by this temporal pivot. Israel’s deliverance is not a private exception but the proof of the rule. Radak’s messianic reading catches one trajectory (“then all nations will praise Yah”), while Malbim’s historical reading imagines neighboring peoples benefiting from Israel’s rescue. Both reflect the psalm’s core intuition: God’s election of Israel is a means of public revelation.

The verse ends where it began: “הַלְלוּ־יָּהּ.” This is inclusio, a device where a unit is framed by repeated words or themes to mark its unity and underline its point. The shortened name Yah, used in early song (Exodus 15:2) and in the Hallel sequence, gives the doxology a kind of temple intimacy. In liturgy, the line migrates: Mizrahi communities place “כִּי גָבַר עָלֵינוּ חַסְדּוֹ” before Baruch She’amar, letting the grammar of the psalm (“for”) become the grammar of worship (“because…”). Sefard communities lift “עָלֵינוּ חַסְדּוֹ” into Hakafot and zemirot, turning a bare clause into a communal refrain. Either way, the line’s figurative punch remains: mercy that “prevails” is mercy experienced as victory.

Formally the verse moves from the perfect (“has prevailed”) to the unbounded (“forever”), from particular (“upon us”) to universal praise (“Hallelu-Yah”). The A→B progression—reason → open horizon → doxology—lays bare the psalm’s thesis in its tightest form: a history of hesed is the world’s invitation to trust God’s ’emet.
