## Analysis Questions

### MacroAnalyst Research Questions (10)

1. What is the precise semantic range and theological significance of the 'mountains' in v. 1? Are they threatening (dangerous terrain, pagan high places like Bashan/Hermon) or promising (Zion, divine dwelling)? How does this ambiguity function rhetorically?
2. How does the title 'maker of heaven and earth' (עשה שמים וארץ) function elsewhere in the Psalter and Hebrew Bible? Is this a credal formula? Does it have polemical force against ANE cosmologies?
3. What is the literary and theological significance of God 'not sleeping' in v. 4? Are there Ugaritic or ANE parallels where deities sleep/require awakening? How does this contrast with Elijah's satire in 1 Kings 18:27 or protests like Psalm 44:23?
4. What is the image of YHWH as 'shade at your right hand' in v. 5? Is this military protection (right hand = weapon side), travel/desert imagery (shade from heat), or temple symbolism (wings of cherubim)? How does צל function elsewhere in psalmic theology?
5. What is the nature of the threat from sun and moon in v. 6? Is this literal (sunstroke, believed lunar influence on mental health), mythological (demonic forces), or metaphorical? What ANE background illuminates moon as dangerous?
6. The six-fold repetition of שמר—is there numerological significance? Why not seven (more common completeness number)? Does the distribution pattern (1-1-1-2 across verses 3-4-5-7-8) have structural purpose?
7. What is the specific meaning of 'your going out and coming in' (צאתך ובואך) in v. 8? Is this a technical term for pilgrimage, a merismus for all life activities, military language (cf. Num 27:17, Deut 28:6), or temple entry/exit?
8. How does this psalm relate literarily and theologically to other Songs of Ascents (Psalms 120-134)? Are there shared vocabulary, themes (Zion, protection, journey), or structural features (brevity, staircase parallelism)?
9. What is the liturgical function of the voice shift from first to second person? Does this reflect antiphonal performance between pilgrim and priest, or movement from individual to congregation? Are there other psalms with similar dialogical structures?
10. How does the progression from individual ('my help,' 'your foot') to collective ('Israel,' v. 4) to individual again ('you,' vv. 5-8) construct identity? What theological claim about the relationship between personal and communal faith is being made?

### MicroAnalyst Interesting Questions (10)

1. What exactly is the semantic range and threat profile of the mountains in v1—are they dangerous terrain, pagan high places, or hopeful symbols (Zion)?
2. Why does the psalm use six-fold שמר repetition rather than seven (the more conventional completeness number in biblical literature)?
3. What is the specific nature of the moon's threat in v6—is this about lunacy beliefs, nocturnal demons, or simply poetic parallelism with sun?
4. How does the 'maker of heaven and earth' formula function elsewhere—is this a fixed creedal phrase, and does it have specific anti-pagan polemical force?
5. What is the precise imagery of YHWH as 'shade at your right hand'—military protection, desert travel relief, temple symbolism, or legal advocacy?
6. Does the phrase 'your going out and coming in' (v8) have technical meaning in pilgrimage, military, or temple contexts, or is it purely a general merismus?
7. How does the voice shift from first to second person function liturgically—who are the implied speakers (pilgrim/priest, individual/congregation)?
8. What ANE parallels exist for gods who 'sleep' or 'slumber' that would make v4's doubled negation particularly polemical?
9. Why does v4 expand from individual ('your guardian') to collective ('guardian of Israel')—what theological claim about personal/communal identity is being made?
10. What is the relationship between the geographical mountains (v1) and the cosmic 'heaven and earth' (v2)—is this movement from particular to universal significant?
