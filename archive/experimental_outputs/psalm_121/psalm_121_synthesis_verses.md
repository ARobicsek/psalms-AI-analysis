# Verse-by-Verse Commentary: Psalm 121

## Verse 1

**שִׁיר לַמַּעֲלוֹת; אֶשָּׂא עֵינַי אֶל־הֶהָרִים, מֵאַיִן יָבֹא עֶזְרִי.**

The psalm opens with a dramatic *mise-en-scène*: a pilgrim, standing at some indeterminate distance from Jerusalem, lifts his eyes toward the mountains and asks an urgent question: "From where will my help come?" (מֵאַיִן יָבֹא עֶזְרִי). The superscription *shir lama'alot* (שִׁיר לַמַּעֲלוֹת, "A song for ascents") situates this within the collection of Psalms 120–134, traditionally associated with pilgrimage to Jerusalem for the three festivals (Deuteronomy 16:16 speaks of עֲלִיָּה לָרֶגֶל, "going up for the festival"). Yet this opening verse is deliberately ambiguous—a hermeneutic puzzle that has fascinated commentators from the medieval period forward.

The crux is the phrase *el he-harim* (אֶל־הֶהָרִים, "to/toward the mountains"). The preposition אֶל (el) means "to" or "toward," not "from," suggesting the mountains are the *object* of the lifting gaze, not necessarily its *source* of help. Are these mountains threatening (dangerous terrain harboring bandits, pagan high places like those condemned in Deuteronomy 12:2: "עַל הֶהָרִים הָרָמִים וְעַל הַגְּבָעוֹת וְתַחַת כָּל־עֵץ רַעֲנָן—upon the high mountains and upon the hills and under every leafy tree")? Or are they promising—Mount Zion itself, the "holy mountain" of God (הַר־קָדְשֶׁךָ, Psalm 15:1)?

Radak's commentary captures this tension perfectly: "כְּמוֹ הַמְצַפֶּה עֵזֶר מֵרָחוֹק שֶׁעוֹלֶה עַל הֶהָרִים וְנוֹשֵׂא עֵינָיו אֵילָךְ וְאֵילָךְ אִם יָבֹאוּ לִי עוֹזְרִים—Like one who looks for help from afar, who ascends the mountains and lifts his eyes this way and that, [asking] if help will come to me." The pilgrim's question is genuine, not rhetorical. The mountains, in ancient Near Eastern cosmology, were the dwelling places of gods (compare Ugaritic *Ṣapānu*, the mountain of Baal). The psalmist stands at a threshold of uncertainty: Will help come from these mountains—from their pagan deities, from their treacherous passes, from Zion's God?

The verb *essa* (אֶשָּׂא, "I lift up") appears in identical construction in Psalm 123:1: "אֵלֶיךָ נָשָׂאתִי אֶת־עֵינַי הַיּשְׁבִי בַּשָּׁמָיִם—To You I lift up my eyes, O You who are enthroned in heaven." There, the direction of hope is unambiguous—*toward* God. Here, by contrast, the lifting is *toward* mountains whose identity and significance remain, for one verse, tantalizingly unclear. This dramatic tension sets up the psalm's theological resolution in verse 2.

## Verse 2

**עֶזְרִי מֵעִם יְהוָה, עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ.**

The answer arrives with decisive clarity: "My help comes from YHWH, maker of heaven and earth." The preposition shifts from אֶל (toward) to מֵעִם (from with/beside), emphasizing that help's *source* is not the mountains themselves but the God who transcends all geography. The creedal formula עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ (oseh shamayim va-aretz, "maker of heaven and earth") is a fixed liturgical phrase appearing in Psalms 115:15, 124:8, 134:3, and 146:6, always in contexts emphasizing God's absolute sovereignty. Genesis 14:19 uses the variant קֹנֵה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ ("creator/possessor of heaven and earth") in Melchizedek's blessing of Abram, and Exodus 20:11 grounds the Sabbath commandment in this same cosmogonic authority: "כִּי שֵׁשֶׁת־יָמִים עָשָׂה יְהוָה אֶת־הַשָּׁמַיִם וְאֶת־הָאָרֶץ—For in six days YHWH made the heavens and the earth."

This is not merely a pious cliché. The phrase functions polemically, asserting that the pilgrim's help comes not from any localized mountain deity (like Baal of Ṣapānu or the gods of Bashan in Psalm 68:16) but from the universal Creator. As Radak notes: "וְהַכֹּל בְּיָדוֹ לַעֲשׂוֹת—Everything is in His power to do." The merism "heaven and earth" (a polar pair expressing totality, like "day and night" or "east and west") encompasses *all* that exists—there is no realm, no force, no threat outside the Creator's dominion.

The phrase appears with particular frequency at structural boundaries. Psalm 124:8 uses it as a *conclusio*: "עֶזְרֵנוּ בְּשֵׁם יְהוָה עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ—Our help is in the name of YHWH, maker of heaven and earth," framing a psalm of national deliverance. Psalm 134:3 employs it as a priestly benediction: "יְבָרֶכְךָ יְהוָה מִצִּיּוֹן עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ—May YHWH bless you from Zion, maker of heaven and earth," closing the entire Songs of Ascents collection. Here, in Psalm 121:2, it resolves the opening question with a cosmological declaration: whatever threats the mountains may pose, they are subsumed under the sovereignty of their Maker.

The liturgical afterlife of this verse is revealing. In Ashkenazic tradition, it appears as a congregational response in the *Kaddish Shalem* (Full Kaddish), recited immediately after the Aramaic petition: "יְהֵא שְׁלָמָא רַבָּא מִן שְׁמַיָא וְחַיִּים עָלֵינוּ... וְאִמְרוּ אָמֵן: עֶזְרִי מֵעִם יְהוָה עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ—May there be abundant peace from heaven and life upon us... and say Amen: My help is from YHWH, Maker of heaven and earth." This liturgical placement transforms a personal confession into a communal affirmation, grounding the prayer for peace in the unshakeable foundation of cosmic creation.

## Verse 3

**אַל־יִתֵּן לַמּוֹט רַגְלֶךָ; אַל־יָנוּם, שֹׁמְרֶךָ.**

At this pivotal juncture, the psalm executes its most dramatic literary move: a shift from first-person confession (vv. 1–2: "I lift my eyes... my help") to second-person priestly assurance (vv. 3–8: "your foot... your guardian... you"). This is not a stylistic accident but a dialogical structure reflecting actual liturgical performance. As Metzudat David explains: "כְּאִלּוּ אֶחָד יֹאמַר לַחֲבֵרוֹ דֶּרֶךְ נֶחָמָה הִנֵּה עֶזְרָה טוֹבָה הִיא—It is as if one says to another, by way of comfort, 'Behold, help is good.'" The pilgrim has voiced existential anxiety; now a priest (or temple attendant, or the congregation itself) responds with authoritative blessing.

The verse opens with two emphatic negations employing the particle אַל (al) with the imperfect, creating strong jussive force: "He will not let... he will not slumber." The first prohibition addresses the specific, physical danger of pilgrimage: "אַל־יִתֵּן לַמּוֹט רַגְלֶךָ—He will not let your foot give way." The verb מוֹט (mot) appears 39 times in the Hebrew Bible, predominantly in the Psalms, with the basic meaning of "totter, slip, shake" (BDB, 556). It is both literal (dangerous mountain paths where a misstep could be fatal) and metaphorical (spiritual or moral instability). Psalm 15:5 promises that the righteous person "לֹא יִמּוֹט לְעוֹלָם—shall never be moved," using the same root to describe covenantal security. Here, the foot (רֶגֶל, regel) stands metonymically for the whole person and the whole pilgrimage—physical, spiritual, and communal.

The second prohibition introduces the dominant motif of the entire psalm: שֹׁמְרֶךָ (shomrekha, "your guardian"). This is the first of *six* appearances of the root שׁ-מ-ר (sh-m-r, "guard, keep, watch") in eight verses (vv. 3, 3, 4, 5, 7, 7, 8). The verb שָׁמַר (shamar) carries rich covenantal resonance throughout Scripture. In Genesis 2:15, the human is placed in Eden "לְעָבְדָהּ וּלְשָׁמְרָהּ—to work it and to guard it"; in the Shema (Deuteronomy 6:17), Israel is commanded "שָׁמוֹר תִּשְׁמְרוּן—you shall diligently keep" God's commandments. The term denotes not passive watching but active, vigilant, covenant-faithful protection.

The assertion "אַל־יָנוּם שֹׁמְרֶךָ—He will not slumber, your guardian" employs the verb נוּם (num), a relatively rare term appearing only six times in the Hebrew Bible (BDB, 630). It denotes a light sleep or dozing, as distinct from full sleep (יָשֵׁן, yashen). The pairing of the two verbs in verse 4 (לֹא־יָנוּם וְלֹא יִישָׁן, "neither slumbers nor sleeps") creates an emphatic hendiadys—two terms expressing a single, intensified idea. This is likely polemical. In 1 Kings 18:27, the prophet Elijah mocks the priests of Baal: "קִרְאוּ בְקוֹל־גָּדוֹל כִּי־אֱלֹהִים הוּא... אוּלַי יָשֵׁן הוּא וְיִקָץ—Cry aloud, for he is a god... perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened." The Ugaritic Baal cycle depicts the storm god's seasonal death and slumber. Against this backdrop, the assertion that YHWH "does not slumber" is not poetic flourish but theological polemic: Israel's God, unlike the dying-and-rising vegetation deities of Canaan, maintains perpetual vigilance.

## Verse 4

**הִנֵּה לֹא־יָנוּם וְלֹא יִישָׁן, שֹׁמֵר יִשְׂרָאֵל.**

The particle הִנֵּה (hinneh, "behold, look!") demands attention, marking what follows as particularly significant. It appears over 1,000 times in the Hebrew Bible, frequently to introduce divine speech or to underscore a dramatic revelation. Here it amplifies the doubled negation already introduced in verse 3, now with both verbs explicitly stated: "לֹא־יָנוּם וְלֹא יִישָׁן—neither slumbers nor sleeps." As the Meiri observes: "הַתְּנוּמָה הִיא שֵׁינָה קַלָּה וְהַשֵּׁינָה שֵׁינָה גְּמוּרָה—Slumber is light sleep and sleep is deep sleep." The progression from lighter to heavier sleep creates a rhetorical climax, asserting that God's watchfulness is absolutely uninterrupted.

This verse makes a crucial theological move by shifting from the individual to the collective: "שֹׁמֵר יִשְׂרָאֵל—the guardian of Israel." The personal "your guardian" (שֹׁמְרֶךָ) of verse 3 is now revealed to be a function of God's covenantal relationship with the entire people. The individual pilgrim's protection is not an isolated divine act but participates in God's larger shomrim (guardianship) of Israel as a covenantal community. This pattern—moving from personal address to collective identity and back to personal—creates a dynamic interplay. As Rashi notes, the sleeplessness of Israel's guardian is demonstrated in the exile: "כִּי בִהְיוֹת הַגָּלוּת דּוֹמֶה לְיָשֵׁן—For while the exile endures, it seems as if [God] sleeps," yet the promise holds that God's vigilance never ceases.

The phrase "guardian of Israel" (שֹׁמֵר יִשְׂרָאֵל) became so central to Jewish consciousness that it entered the daily liturgy in multiple forms. It appears in the bedtime Shema (K'riat Shema Al HaMitah) after the Priestly Blessing: "יִשָּׂא יְהוָה פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ וְיָשֵׂם לְךָ שָׁלוֹם: הִנֵּה לֹא יָנוּם וְלֹא יִישָׁן שׁוֹמֵר יִשְׂרָאֵל—May YHWH lift His face toward you and grant you peace: Behold, the Guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps." The pairing with the Priestly Blessing reframes divine watchfulness as continuous benediction. Intriguingly, the verse also appears embedded in the Ashkenazic Yom Kippur Vidui (confessional), where—amid calls for national repentance—it reassures that God's watchful care persists even in judgment: "אַל תִּירָא יַעֲקֹב... שׁוּבָה יִשְׂרָאֵל: הִנֵּה לֹא יָנוּם וְלֹא יִישָׁן שׁוֹמֵר יִשְׂרָאֵל: כַּכָּתוּב... שׁוּבָה יִשְׂרָאֵל עַד יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ—Fear not, Jacob... Return, Israel: Behold, the Guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps: As it is written... Return, Israel, to YHWH your God" (Hosea 14:2).

The polemic against sleeping gods finds its clearest biblical expression in Isaiah 5:27, which describes the coming army that God will summon: "אֵין־עָיֵף וְאֵין־כּוֹשֵׁל בּוֹ, לֹא יָנוּם וְלֹא יִישָׁן—None is weary, none stumbles among them; none slumbers or sleeps." Here, the denial of sleep applies to God's *agents*, but the theological implication is clear: a God who neither slumbers nor sleeps deploys forces that inherit divine vigilance. The contrast with ancient Near Eastern mythology is stark. In the Akkadian *Atrahasis Epic*, the gods are disturbed by human noise and send a flood because they cannot sleep; in the Babylonian *Enuma Elish*, Apsu's sleep is a vulnerability exploited by Ea. The God of Israel requires no sleep, admits no vulnerability, and maintains perpetual, attentive care over the covenant people.

## Verse 5

**יְהוָה שֹׁמְרֶךָ; יְהוָה צִלְּךָ, עַל־יַד יְמִינֶךָ.**

The divine name יְהוָה (YHWH) appears *twice* in this verse, a striking anaphora (repetition at the beginning of successive clauses) that emphasizes the personal, covenantal relationship between God and the worshiper. This is "second-person theology"—not abstract discourse about God but direct address *to* the individual: "YHWH is *your* guardian; YHWH is *your* shade." The repetition of the Tetragrammaton five times in verses 5, 7, and 8 creates a sonic and theological drumbeat, asserting divine presence with increasing intensity.

The first colon reprises the שׁ-מ-ר motif: "יְהוָה שֹׁמְרֶךָ—YHWH is your guardian." The second colon introduces a new metaphor: "יְהוָה צִלְּךָ—YHWH is your shade." The noun צֵל (tsel, "shadow, shade") appears 53 times in the Hebrew Bible with multiple valences. Literally, shade is essential protection from the sun's lethal heat in the ancient Near Eastern climate (compare Jonah 4:5–6, where Jonah sits "בַּצֵּל עַד אֲשֶׁר יִרְאֶה מַה־יִּהְיֶה בָּעִיר—in the shade until he should see what would happen to the city"). Metaphorically, shade represents any protective covering. In the Song of Songs 2:3, the beloved declares: "בְּצִלּוֹ חִמַּדְתִּי וְיָשַׁבְתִּי—In his shade I delighted to sit," evoking romantic shelter. Isaiah 25:4 praises God: "כִּי־הָיִיתָ מָעוֹז... צֵל מֵחֹרֶב—For You have been a stronghold... shade from heat."

The most potent biblical shade imagery is that of *God's shadow*. Psalm 91:1 opens with this declaration: "יֹשֵׁב בְּסֵתֶר עֶלְיוֹן בְּצֵל שַׁדַּי יִתְלוֹנָן—Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will lodge in the shadow of the Almighty," where "shadow" (צֵל) is paralleled with "shelter" (סֵתֶר), emphasizing comprehensive divine protection. Psalm 17:8 intensifies this: "הַסְתִּירֵנִי בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ—Hide me in the shadow of Your wings," where the shade becomes avian, suggesting the hovering, protective presence of a mother bird (cf. Deuteronomy 32:11's eagle imagery).

The phrase "עַל־יַד יְמִינֶךָ—at your right hand" is richly multivalent. Ibn Ezra understands it militarily: the right hand is the weapon side, and the phrase "suggests military protection—the right hand being the weapon side, vulnerable in combat. The divine warrior stations himself as shield at the fighter's exposed flank." This reading finds support in Psalm 110:5: "אֲדֹנָי עַל־יְמִינְךָ מָחַץ בְּיוֹם־אַפּוֹ מְלָכִים—The Lord is at your right hand; He crushes kings in the day of His wrath," where God's position at the right hand is explicitly martial. Alternatively, the right hand may evoke legal or social contexts—the place of honor and advocacy. Psalm 16:8 declares: "שִׁוִּיתִי יְהוָה לְנֶגְדִּי תָמִיד כִּי מִימִינִי בַּל־אֶמּוֹט—I have set YHWH before me always; because He is at my right hand, I shall not be moved." Here, the right-hand position ensures stability and prevents "moving" (מוֹט)—recalling the "not letting the foot give way" of verse 3.

In modern liturgy, this verse finds a particularly poignant application. In the Sefardic rite for *Pidyon HaBen* (Redemption of the Firstborn Son), these protective verses are recited by the Kohen as blessings for the newly redeemed infant: "יְהוָה שֹׁמְרֶךָ יְהוָה צִלְּךָ עַל יַד יְמִינֶךָ... יְהוָה יִשְׁמָרְךָ מִכָּל־רָע יִשְׁמֹר אֶת־נַפְשֶׁךָ—The LORD is your guardian, the LORD is your shade at your right hand... The LORD will guard you from all evil; He will guard your soul." The selection of this text for a life-cycle ritual underscores its function as a comprehensive prayer for protection from infancy onward.

## Verse 6

**יוֹמָם הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ לֹא־יַכֶּכָּה, וְיָרֵחַ בַּלָּיְלָה.**

This verse operationalizes the "shade" metaphor of verse 5, specifying the celestial threats from which God protects: "By day the sun will not strike you, nor the moon by night." The structure is a merism—a figure of speech where two opposite poles represent the entirety of a spectrum. "Day and night" (יוֹמָם... בַּלָּיְלָה, yomam... ba-laylah) encompasses the full 24-hour cycle, asserting that divine protection is temporally comprehensive and uninterrupted. Genesis 8:22 uses the same device: "יוֹם וָלַיְלָה לֹא יִשְׁבֹּתוּ—Day and night shall not cease," describing the restored cosmic order after the flood. Similarly, Psalm 55:11 laments: "יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה יְסוֹבְבֻהָ עַל־חוֹמֹתֶיהָ—Day and night they make their rounds on its walls," depicting continuous enemy activity.

The sun's danger is obvious: in the ancient Near East, sunstroke (יַכֶּכָּה, yakkekah, from נָכָה, nakah, "to strike, smite") was a real and often fatal threat to travelers in the open. Job 30:28 describes the sufferer's condition: "קֹדֵר הִלַּכְתִּי בְּלֹא חַמָּה—I go about blackened, but not by the sun," implying that sun-blackening was a common affliction. Jonah 4:8 recounts God appointing "רוּחַ קָדִים חֲרִישִׁית וַתַּךְ הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ עַל־רֹאשׁ יוֹנָה—a sultry east wind, and the sun beat down on Jonah's head," driving him to despair. The verb נָכָה (to strike, smite) appears 501 times in the Hebrew Bible, predominantly in military contexts (Deuteronomy 7:2: "וְהִכִּיתָם הַחֲרֵם תַּחֲרִים אֹתָם—you shall strike them down, you shall utterly destroy them"), but also in natural contexts like plague (Exodus 9:15: "וָאַךְ אֹתְךָ בַּדֶּבֶר—I struck you with pestilence") and divine judgment (Psalm 102:5: "הֻכָּה כָעֵשֶׂב וַיִּבַשׁ לִבִּי—My heart is stricken and withered like grass").

The moon's threat is more enigmatic. The phrase "וְיָרֵחַ בַּלָּיְלָה—nor the moon by night" lacks an explicit verb, which must be supplied from the first colon: "לֹא־יַכֶּכָּה... [וְיָרֵחַ בַּלָּיְלָה לֹא־יַכֶּכָּה]—will not strike you... [nor will the moon by night strike you]." But how does the moon "strike"? Ancient beliefs about lunar influence ranged from medical (the moon was thought to cause or exacerbate mental illness—hence "lunacy," from Latin *luna*, "moon") to demonic (the moon as a time when malevolent spiritual forces were active). Isaiah 13:10, in an oracle of cosmic judgment, declares: "לֹא־יָהֵל כּוֹכָב בִּנְשָׁפוֹ וְחָשַׁךְ הַיָּרֵחַ—The stars will not shine their light, and the moon will be dark," where the moon is one of the celestial powers subject to divine control. More directly, Isaiah 30:26 describes eschatological healing: "וְהָיָה אוֹר־הַלְּבָנָה כְּאוֹר הַחַמָּה וְאוֹר הַחַמָּה יִהְיֶה שִׁבְעָתַיִם—The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold," suggesting that *both* sun and moon were understood as powerful forces requiring divine moderation.

Radak offers a medical interpretation rooted in humoral theory: "כִּי חֹם הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ יְיַבֵּשׁ הַלֵּחָה וְהַיָּרֵחַ יוֹסִיף הַלַּחְלָחָה יִהְיֶה מִמֶּנָּה הַקְּרִירוּת, וְהַחֹם וְהַקֹּר הֵם סִבַּת הַתַּחֲלוּאִים וְהָאֵל יִתְבָּרַךְ יִשְׁמֹר מֵהֶם—For the sun's heat dries the moisture [of the body], and the moon increases moisture, from which comes coldness, and heat and cold are the cause of diseases, and God, blessed be He, will guard from them." This reflects the ancient understanding that disease resulted from imbalances in the body's hot/cold, wet/dry humors, which celestial bodies could influence.

More theologically, the sun and moon were primary objects of pagan worship in the ancient Near East. The Mesopotamian pantheon included *Shamash* (sun god, cognate with Hebrew שֶׁמֶשׁ) and *Sin* (moon god, perhaps related to the name Sinai). Deuteronomy 4:19 warns Israel: "וּפֶן־תִּשָּׂא עֵינֶיךָ הַשָּׁמַיְמָה... וְהִשְׁתַּחֲוִיתָ לָהֶם וַעֲבַדְתָּם—And lest you lift your eyes to heaven... and worship them and serve them," referring to sun, moon, and stars. By asserting that *YHWH* protects from the sun and moon, Psalm 121 subtly demythologizes these celestial bodies: they are not gods to be feared or worshiped but created elements under God's sovereign control. As Ibn Ezra tersely notes: "הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ תַּזִּיק בְּרֹב הַחֹם שֶׁלָּהּ וְהַלְּבָנָה בַּלַּיְלָה תּוֹסִיף לֵחָה מוֹלֶדֶת תַּחֲלוּאִים, וְזֶה הַדָּבָר בָּרוּר וּמְנֻסֶּה—The sun harms through its excessive heat, and the moon by night increases moisture that generates diseases, and this matter is clear and tested," treating them as natural phenomena, not divine powers.

## Verse 7

**יְהוָה יִשְׁמָרְךָ מִכָּל־רָע; יִשְׁמֹר אֶת־נַפְשֶׁךָ.**

The sixth and seventh occurrences of the root שׁ-מ-ר appear in quick succession: "יִשְׁמָרְךָ... יִשְׁמֹר—will guard you... will guard." This intensifying repetition (anadiplosis, or "staircase parallelism," where a word from the first colon is picked up and developed in the second) propels the psalm toward its climax. The double use of שָׁמַר in a single verse underscores the emphatic, comprehensive nature of divine protection being proclaimed.

The first colon asserts: "יְהוָה יִשְׁמָרְךָ מִכָּל־רָע—YHWH will guard you from all evil." The phrase מִכָּל־רָע (mikol-ra, "from all evil") is maximally inclusive, leaving no category of harm unaddressed. The term רָע (ra) has an extraordinary semantic range in biblical Hebrew, encompassing moral evil (Genesis 6:5: "רַעַת הָאָדָם—the wickedness of humanity"), physical disaster (Amos 3:6: "הֲיִהְיֶה רָעָה בְּעִיר וַיהוָה לֹא עָשָׂה—Does disaster befall a city unless YHWH has done it?"), emotional distress (Genesis 44:34: "פֶּן־אֶרְאֶה בָרָע אֲשֶׁר יִמְצָא אֶת־אָבִי—lest I see the evil that would come upon my father"), and enemy action (Psalm 23:4: "לֹא־אִירָא רָע—I will fear no evil").

The comprehensiveness of מִכָּל־רָע finds a close parallel in Psalm 91, another psalm of protection. There, verse 10 promises: "לֹא־תְאֻנֶּה אֵלֶיךָ רָעָה—No evil shall befall you," and verse 3 specifies protection "מִדֶּבֶר הַוּוֹת מִדֶּבֶר הַוּוֹת—from the deadly pestilence." The absence of qualifiers or exceptions in Psalm 121:7's "all evil" creates a rhetorical absolute. As Radak comments: "שֶׁלֹּא יַזִּיקוּךָ בְּנֵי אָדָם וְחַיּוֹת הַשָּׂדֶה... שֶׁלֹּא תָמוּת מִתּוֹךְ הַחֳלָאִים—So that people will not harm you, nor wild animals... so that you will not die from diseases," reading רָע as encompassing every conceivable threat—human, animal, and natural.

The second colon narrows from the comprehensive to the essential: "יִשְׁמֹר אֶת־נַפְשֶׁךָ—He will guard your *nefesh*." The noun נֶפֶשׁ (nefesh) is notoriously difficult to translate precisely. BDB (659-661) lists its meanings as "soul, living being, life, self, person, desire, passion, appetite, emotion." It can refer to physical life (Genesis 9:5: "אַךְ־אֶת־דִּמְכֶם לְנַפְשֹׁתֵיכֶם—your lifeblood I will require"), the essential self (Deuteronomy 6:5: "בְּכָל־נַפְשְׁךָ—with all your soul"), or even serve as a reflexive pronoun (Genesis 27:25: "הַגִּשָׁה לִּי וְאֹכְלָה מִצֵּיד בְּנִי לְמַעַן תְּבָרֶכְךָ נַפְשִׁי—Bring it to me and I will eat of my son's game, that *I myself* may bless you").

Here, the shift from guarding "you" (יִשְׁמָרְךָ) to guarding "your נֶפֶשׁ" (יִשְׁמֹר אֶת־נַפְשֶׁךָ) suggests a movement from external to internal, from circumstantial protection to preservation of the essential life force. The Meiri understands this as dual protection: "וְהִבְטִיחוֹ בִּשְׁמִירַת הַגּוּף וּשְׁמִירַת הַנֶּפֶשׁ—And He assured him with protection of the body and protection of the soul," interpreting רָע as physical harm and נֶפֶשׁ as the spiritual essence that must also be guarded.

Liturgically, this verse has become a staple of protective prayer in Jewish tradition. In the Sefardic home ritual for Shabbat, following *Shalom Aleichem* (the song welcoming Sabbath angels), verses from Psalm 121 are recited, including: "יוֹמָם הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ לֹא יַכֶּכָּה וְיָרֵחַ בַּלָּיְלָה: יְהֹוָה יִשְׁמְרְךָ מִכָּל רָע יִשְׁמֹר אֶת־נַפְשֶׁךָ: יְהֹוָה יִשְׁמָר צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ מֵעַתָּה וְעַד עוֹלָם—By day the sun shall not strike you, nor the moon by night: The LORD will guard you from all evil; He will guard your soul: The LORD will guard your going out and your coming in, from now and forever." This custom, recited at the threshold between sacred Sabbath time and the coming week's activities, frames the home as a space of perpetual divine guardianship.

## Verse 8

**יְהוָה יִשְׁמָר־צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ, מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם.**

The psalm concludes with a sixth and final use of שָׁמַר, now in a comprehensive blessing formula that achieves total scope through two merismus pairs: "יְהוָה יִשְׁמָר־צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ—YHWH will guard your going out and your coming in" (spatial/activity totality), "מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם—from now and forever" (temporal totality). The verse thus constructs a rhetorical fortress: no space, no time, no activity falls outside the scope of divine protection.

The phrase "צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ" (tset'kha u-vo'ekha, "your going out and your coming in") is a fixed merism appearing throughout the Hebrew Bible. Its most famous occurrence is in the Deuteronomic blessing-curse formula. Deuteronomy 28:6 promises the obedient: "בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה בְּבֹאֶךָ וּבָרוּךְ אַתָּה בְּצֵאתֶךָ—Blessed shall you be in your coming in, and blessed shall you be in your going out," while verse 19 warns the disobedient: "אָרוּר אַתָּה בְּבֹאֶךָ וְאָרוּר אַתָּה בְּצֵאתֶךָ—Cursed shall you be in your coming in, and cursed shall you be in your going out." The merism can denote military activity: Numbers 27:17 describes the need for a leader "אֲשֶׁר־יֵצֵא לִפְנֵיהֶם וַאֲשֶׁר יָבֹא לִפְנֵיהֶם—who shall go out before them and who shall come in before them," referring to military campaigns. More generally, it signifies the totality of life's activities and movements. Joshua 14:11 uses it comprehensively: "כְּכֹחִי אָז וּכְכֹחִי עַתָּה לַמִּלְחָמָה וְלָצֵאת וְלָבוֹא—My strength then was as my strength is now, for war and for going out and coming in."

In Psalm 121:8, the phrase functions at multiple levels. For the original pilgrimage context, it most obviously refers to the journey itself: going out from one's hometown and coming in to Jerusalem, then the return journey (going out from Jerusalem and coming in to home). Radak reads it this way: "בְּצֵאתְךָ מֵהַגָּלוּת וּבְבוֹאֲךָ לְאֶרֶץ יִשְׂרָאֵל תָּבוֹא בְשָׁלוֹם—In your going out from the exile and your coming in to the land of Israel, you will come in peace." But the phrase's conventional use as a merism for all activity means it extends far beyond literal travel: every departure and arrival, every beginning and ending, every enterprise undertaken and completed.

The temporal merism "מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם" (me-atah ve-ad-olam, "from now and forever") appears multiple times in the Psalter, often at psalm conclusions. Psalm 113:2, in a doxology, declares: "יְהִי שֵׁם יְהוָה מְבֹרָךְ מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם—Let the name of YHWH be blessed from now and forever." Psalm 115:18, at the climax of a psalm praising God's sovereignty, proclaims: "וַאֲנַחְנוּ נְבָרֵךְ יָהּ מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם הַלְלוּ־יָהּ—But we will bless YAH from now and forever. Hallelujah!" Psalm 125:2, another Song of Ascents, uses it to describe God's protection: "יְרוּשָׁלַם הָרִים סָבִיב לָהּ וַיהוָה סָבִיב לְעַמּוֹ מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם—Jerusalem, hills enfold it, and YHWH enfolds His people from now and forever."

The term עוֹלָם (olam) presents a fascinating semantic complexity. BDB (761-763) defines it as "long duration, antiquity, futurity," with meanings spanning from remote past to indefinite future to eternity. In pre-exilic texts, it often denotes "as long as one lives" or "a very long time" (1 Samuel 1:22: "וְיָשַׁב שָׁם עַד־עוֹלָם—and remain there forever," meaning during Samuel's lifetime). In later texts, particularly those influenced by apocalyptic thought, it takes on the meaning of "eternity" in a metaphysical sense. Psalm 121:8's "וְעַד־עוֹלָם" functions as a comprehensive temporal boundary—whether understood as "as long as life endures" or "into eternity," it asserts that divine protection has no expiration date.

Liturgically, this verse has become ubiquitous as a blessing formula. In *Tefillat HaDerech*, the Traveler's Prayer, supplementary verses invoke protection: "כִּי מַלְאָכָיו יְצַוֶּה לָךְ לִשְׁמָרְךָ בְּכָל דְרָכֶיךָ: יי יִשְׁמָר צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ מֵעַתָּה וְעַד עוֹלָם—For He will command His angels concerning you, to guard you in all your ways: YHWH will guard your going out and your coming in from now and forever" (Psalm 91:11 paired with Psalm 121:8). The pairing links angelic and divine guardianship, human vulnerability and cosmic protection, specific journey and eternal care.

The psalm ends, as it began, with a question—but the question has been transformed. Verse 1 asked in uncertainty: "מֵאַיִן יָבֹא עֶזְרִי—From where will my help come?" Verse 8 provides a multidimensional answer: help comes from YHWH (v. 2), who is maker of heaven and earth (v. 2), who neither slumbers nor sleeps (v. 4), who is guardian of Israel (v. 4) and your personal guardian (v. 5), your shade at your right hand (v. 5), who protects from sun and moon (v. 6), from all evil (v. 7), who guards your *nefesh* (v. 7), your going out and coming in (v. 8), from this moment until the end of time (v. 8). The cumulative effect is overwhelming—a piling up of protective assertions, a systematic dismantling of every possible source of anxiety. The pilgrim who began by lifting eyes to ambiguous mountains ends enfolded in a comprehensive shield of divine care, temporally infinite and spatially all-encompassing. The journey to Jerusalem becomes a metaphor for the journey of faith itself: from uncertainty to trust, from looking to mountains to looking to their Maker, from "where?" to "from YHWH."
