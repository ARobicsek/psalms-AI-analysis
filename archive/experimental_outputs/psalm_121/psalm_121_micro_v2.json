      "commentary": "Opening with double identification 'שִׁיר לַמַּעֲלוֹת' (song of ascents) establishes genre, but the immediate question 'מֵאַיִן יָבֹא עֶזְרִי' (from where will my help come?) creates dramatic tension. The mountains (הֶהָרִים) are deliberately ambiguous—are they source of help (Zion?) or source of threat (dangerous terrain/pagan high places)? The verb אֶשָּׂא (I lift) with עֵינַי (my eyes) is common pilgrimage language, but the preposition אֶל (to/toward) rather than מִן (from) leaves interpretive space. This verse sets up a question that v2 must resolve.",

      "commentary": "Immediate answer to v1's question with emphatic positioning of עֶזְרִי (my help) at start. The phrase 'מֵעִם יְהֹוָה' (from with/beside the LORD) is spatially interesting—help comes from God's presence, not from mountains. The epithet 'עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ' (maker of heaven and earth) is a cosmic sovereignty claim appearing in creation contexts (Gen 1:1, 14:19, Ps 115:15, 124:8, 134:3, 146:6). This moves from particular (mountains) to universal (all creation), suggesting any localized source of help is inadequate compared to the cosmic Creator.",

This suggests liturgical dialogue—priestly response to pilgrim's question. The negation אַל with imperfect verb creates strong jussive/assurance force. First occurrence of שֹׁמְרֶךָ (your guardian), introducing the dominant motif of the psalm (שמר appears 6x total).

This intensification through synonymous parallelism creates absolute assurance of vigilance. Crucial expansion from 'your guardian' (v3) to 'guardian of Israel' (שׁוֹמֵר יִשְׂרָאֵל)—individual protection grounded in collective covenantal identity. The doubled sleep vocabulary (נום/ישן) may polemicize against ANE myths of sleeping/dying gods (Baal's death cycles, El's slumber, cf. 1 Kgs 18:27's mockery).

The divine name יְהֹוָה appears twice in parallel cola for maximum emphasis—covenant relationship and personal care. The metaphor צֵל (shade) is multivalent: protection from sun (literal for pilgrimage), military protection (shade as covering), or even temple imagery (shadow of wings). The phrase עַל־יַד יְמִינֶךָ (at/over your right hand) suggests either military context (right hand = weapon side, divine warrior protects warrior's vulnerable side) or legal/social protection (right hand as place of honor/advocacy).",

    "What is the specific nature of the moon's threat in v6—is this about lunacy beliefs, nocturnal demons, or simply poetic parallelism with sun?",
    "How does the 'maker of heaven and earth' formula function elsewhere—is this a fixed creedal phrase, and does it have specific anti-pagan polemical force?",
    "What is the precise imagery of YHWH as 'shade at your right hand'—military protection, desert travel relief, temple symbolism, or legal advocacy?",
    "Does the phrase 'your going out and coming in' (v8) have technical meaning in pilgrimage, military, or temple contexts, or is it purely a general merismus?",
    "How does the voice shift from first to second person function liturgically—who are the implied speakers (pilgrim/priest, individual/congregation)?",
    "What ANE parallels exist for gods who 'sleep' or 'slumber' that would make v4's doubled negation particularly polemical?",
    "Why does v4 expand from individual ('your guardian') to collective ('guardian of Israel')—what theological claim about personal/communal identity is being made?",
    "What is the relationship between the geographical mountains (v1) and the cosmic 'heaven and earth' (v2)—is this movement from particular to universal significant?"
