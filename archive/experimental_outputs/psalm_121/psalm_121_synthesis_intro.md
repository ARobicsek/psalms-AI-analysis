# Introduction Essay

The fifteen Songs of Ascents (Psalms 120–134) constitute a distinct liturgical collection, and among them, Psalm 121 occupies a unique position. At first glance, it appears deceptively simple—a traveler's prayer for protection on the journey to Jerusalem. But the psalm's true sophistication lies not in complexity but in compression: it transforms individual anxiety into communal assurance through a dramatic liturgical dialogue that systematically dismantles Ancient Near Eastern religious anxieties and replaces them with the all-encompassing protection of YHWH as cosmic creator.

The psalm's opening question—אֶשָּׂא עֵינַי אֶל־הֶהָרִים מֵאַיִן יָבֹא עֶזְרִי ("I lift my eyes to the mountains; from where will my help come?")—is deliberately ambiguous. The mountains (*he-harim*) are not simply geographical features of the pilgrimage landscape. In the Ancient Near East, mountains were the dwelling places of gods, the high places where the divine and human realms met. The Canaanite storm god Baal resided on Mount Zaphon; the Mesopotamian gods convened on the cosmic mountain. Are these mountains a source of threat—dangerous terrain harboring bandits and wild beasts, or pagan cult sites atop Israel's hills? Or are they a source of hope—Mount Zion itself, the dwelling place of YHWH? The ambiguity is strategic. It represents the pilgrim's moment of vulnerability and uncertainty, standing at the threshold of the journey with eyes scanning the horizon for help that might not come.

The answer arrives swiftly and decisively: עֶזְרִי מֵעִם יְהֹוָה עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ ("My help comes from YHWH, maker of heaven and earth"). This creedal formula, which appears elsewhere in the Psalter (Ps 115:15, 124:8, 134:3) and biblical literature (Gen 14:19, 22), is not mere theological decoration. It is a cosmic sovereignty claim that moves the psalm from the particular (mountains) to the universal (all creation). The epithet "maker of heaven and earth" (*oseh shamayim va-aretz*) functions polemically: it asserts that the source of protection is not any localized deity of mountain or storm, but the God who made the entire cosmos—mountains, heavens, and all. As Radak notes, this formula emphasizes that "הכל בידו לעשות" ("everything is in His power to do"). The pilgrim's help comes not from any geographical or cultic location, but from the one whose creative power encompasses all locations.

At this pivotal moment, the psalm executes its most striking rhetorical move: a dramatic shift from first-person confession (vv. 1–2) to second-person priestly assurance (vv. 3–8). This is not a stylistic accident but a liturgical structure. The scholarly consensus, reflected in commentaries from medieval exegetes through modern scholarship, understands this as a dialogue between pilgrim and priest (or temple attendant). The pilgrim voices the question; the priest responds with blessing. As Metzudat David explains: "כאלו אחד יאמר לחבירו דרך נחמה הנה עזרה טובה היא" ("It is as if one says to another, by way of comfort, 'Behold, help is good'"). This dialogical structure transforms the psalm from private prayer into communal liturgy, from individual anxiety into corporate reassurance.

The priestly response builds systematically, centered on the six-fold repetition of the root שמר (*shamar*, "to guard/keep"). This incantatory repetition—appearing in verses 3 (twice), 4, 5, 7 (twice), and 8—is the psalm's sonic and thematic heartbeat. The verb *shamar* carries rich covenantal resonance throughout the Hebrew Bible, denoting not passive watching but active, covenant-faithful protection. When Genesis 2:15 says that humans were placed in Eden "to work it and *guard it*" (*le-ovdah u-le-shomrah*), or when Deuteronomy repeatedly commands Israel to "*guard* the commandments" (*shamor et ha-mitzvot*), the term connotes vigilant care and faithful preservation. Here, that same covenantal vigilance is applied to God's protection of the pilgrim.

The psalm's polemical thrust becomes most explicit in verses 3–4, which employ emphatic negation to contrast YHWH with other deities. The double negative—לֹא־יָנוּם וְלֹא יִישָׁן ("neither slumbers nor sleeps")—likely targets Ancient Near Eastern myths of divine inattention. The Ugaritic Baal cycle depicts the storm god's seasonal death and slumber; the prophet Elijah mockingly suggests that Baal might be sleeping and need awakening (1 Kgs 18:27: "קְרָא בְקוֹל־גָּדוֹל כִּי־אֱלֹהִים הוּא... אוּלַי יָשֵׁן הוּא וְיִקָץ"—"Cry with a loud voice, for he is a god... perhaps he is asleep and will awaken"). Against this backdrop, the assertion that YHWH "neither slumbers nor sleeps" is not poetic flourish but theological polemic. As the Meiri observes, "התנומה היא שינה קלה והשינה שינה גמורה" ("slumber is light sleep and sleep is deep sleep")—the doubling intensifies the claim of absolute, uninterrupted vigilance.

The expansion from individual to communal in verse 4—שֹׁמֵר יִשְׂרָאֵל ("guardian of Israel")—is theologically crucial. The personal protection promised to the individual pilgrim is grounded in God's covenantal protection of the entire people. This movement from singular to collective and back to singular creates a dynamic interplay between personal and communal identity, suggesting that individual trust is not isolated piety but participation in Israel's corporate relationship with God.

Verses 5–6 deploy a cluster of protective metaphors that address both literal and symbolic dangers. The image of YHWH as "shade" (*tzel*) operates on multiple registers. Literally, shade is essential protection from the sun's deadly heat in the ancient Near Eastern climate—sunstroke (*shemesh lo yakkekah*, "the sun will not strike you") was a genuine threat to travelers. The psalm extends this protection to nighttime, noting that "the moon by night" (*ve-yareach ba-laylah*) will not harm. While lunar danger might seem puzzling to modern readers, ancient beliefs about lunar influence on mental health (reflected in terms like "lunacy") and nocturnal hazards make this a comprehensive day-night protection formula—a merismus encompassing all time.

The metaphor of shade also carries theological depth. As Ibn Ezra notes, the phrase יְהֹוָה צִלְּךָ עַל־יַד יְמִינֶךָ ("YHWH is your shade at your right hand") suggests military protection—the right hand being the weapon side, vulnerable in combat. The divine warrior stations himself as shield at the fighter's exposed flank. This imagery of God as protective covering recurs throughout the Psalter, most famously in Psalm 91:1: "יֹשֵׁב בְּסֵתֶר עֶלְיוֹן בְּצֵל שַׁדַּי יִתְלוֹנָן" ("Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will lodge in the shadow of the Almighty").

The psalm's climactic verses (7–8) achieve comprehensive totality through multiple merismus pairs. The phrase מִכָּל־רָע ("from all evil") encompasses every possible harm—physical, spiritual, cosmic. The specification "He will guard your *nefesh*" (soul/life) moves from external threats to the essential self. The final verse deploys perhaps the most significant merismus in biblical literature: צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹאֶךָ ("your going out and your coming in"). This phrase carries technical meanings across biblical Hebrew. It can denote military campaigns (Num 27:17: "אֲשֶׁר יֵצֵא לִפְנֵיהֶם וַאֲשֶׁר יָבֹא לִפְנֵיהֶם"—"who shall go out before them and who shall come in before them"), but more fundamentally, it is a merismus for the totality of life's activities. Deuteronomy's blessings and curses employ this formula repeatedly: "בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה בְּבֹאֶךָ וּבָרוּךְ אַתָּה בְּצֵאתֶךָ" ("Blessed shall you be in your coming in, and blessed shall you be in your going out," Deut 28:6).

The temporal pair מֵעַתָּה וְעַד־עוֹלָם ("from now and forever") completes the totality. Spatial (going/coming), temporal (now/forever), and comprehensive (all evil)—the psalm has constructed a rhetorical fortress of divine protection that leaves no gap, no moment, no threat unguarded. This is not hyperbole but theological assertion: the God who made all cannot be limited by any of the boundaries that constrain lesser powers.

Why did this psalm earn its place in the biblical canon and achieve such prominence in Jewish liturgical life? Its power lies in the perfect marriage of form and function. The six-fold *shamar* repetition does not merely describe protection—it enacts it. The liturgy transforms speech into reality; the very recitation becomes an invocation of the protection it proclaims. The psalm addresses universal human anxiety—the vulnerability of the journey, the threat of the unknown—but grounds that anxiety in Israel's specific covenantal relationship with YHWH. It speaks both to the particular historical context of pilgrimage to Jerusalem and to the timeless human condition of seeking security in an uncertain world.

The psalm's dialogical structure may also hint at its origins in temple liturgy. Scholars have long noted that the Songs of Ascents share distinctive linguistic features, including "staircase parallelism" (anadiplosis) where key words climb from line to line. While Psalm 121 doesn't employ this device as extensively as some of its companions, its movement from question to answer, from individual to priest, suggests a liturgical performance where roles were clearly delineated and the exchange itself was part of the ritual. The pilgrim ascending toward Jerusalem would have experienced this psalm not as solitary meditation but as communal liturgy, with temple personnel responding to the pilgrim's voiced anxiety with authoritative assurance.

In the end, Psalm 121 achieves theological sophistication through structural simplicity. It needs no complex imagery, no elaborate metaphors, no extended narratives. Its power lies in the relentless accumulation of divine protection, the systematic dismantling of every source of anxiety, and the transformation of individual fear into communal trust. The pilgrim who began by looking to the mountains—whether in hope or fear—ends by looking beyond all mountains to the God who made them, who neither sleeps nor slumbers, who guards with perfect vigilance from this moment until the end of time.

# Modern Jewish Liturgical Use

Psalm 121 appears extensively in Jewish liturgy, functioning primarily as a prayer for divine protection and reassurance. The psalm is recited in its entirety as a supplementary text following the silent Amidah in weekday Maariv and Shabbat Mincha across Ashkenaz, Sefard, and Edot HaMizrach traditions, serving as a concluding prayer of comfort after the main statutory service. It also appears in the Rosh Hashanah liturgy—after Maariv at the holiday's conclusion and within an expanded Pesukei Dezimra in the Edot HaMizrach morning service. Additionally, the psalm is incorporated into the monthly Kiddush Levanah (Sanctification of the Moon) ritual.

Individual verses and phrases from Psalm 121 have been extracted for specific liturgical contexts. The verse עֶזְרִי מֵעִם יְהֹוָה עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ ("My help is from YHWH, Maker of heaven and earth") functions as a congregational response in the Ashkenazic Kaddish Shalem, recited immediately after the Aramaic plea: "יְהֵא שְׁלָמָא רַבָּא מִן שְׁמַיָא וְחַיִּים עָלֵינוּ... וְאִמְרוּ אָמֵן: עֶזְרִי מֵעִם יְהוָה עשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ" ("May there be abundant peace from heaven and life upon us... and say Amen: My help is from YHWH, Maker of heaven and earth"). This transforms the psalm's confession of trust into a liturgical affirmation following prayer.

The verse הִנֵּה לֹא־יָנוּם וְלֹא יִישָׁן שׁוֹמֵר יִשְׂרָאֵל ("Behold, the Guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps") appears in multiple protective contexts: within the bedtime Shema (K'riat Shema Al HaMitah) after the Priestly Blessing—"יִשָּׂא יְהֹוָה פָּנָיו אֵלֶֽיךָ וְיָשֵׂם לְךָ שָׁלוֹם: הִנֵּה לֺא יָנוּם וְלֺא יִישָׁן שׁוֹמֵר יִשְׂרָאֵל" ("May YHWH lift His face toward you and grant you peace: Behold, the Guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps")—and embedded in the Yom Kippur Vidui. The closing verse יְהֹוָה יִשְׁמׇר־צֵאתְךָ֥ וּבוֹאֶ֑ךָ appears in the Shabbat home ritual (particularly Sefardic) following Shalom Aleichem, paired with Psalm 91:11 to create a blessing of angelic and divine protection at the threshold: "כִּ֣י מַ֭לְאָכָיו יְצַוֶּה־לָּ֑ךְ לִ֝שְׁמׇרְךָ֗ בְּכׇל־דְּרָכֶֽיךָ: יְֽהֹוָ֗ה יִשְׁמׇר־צֵאתְךָ֥ וּבוֹאֶ֑ךָ" ("For He will command His angels concerning you, to guard you in all your ways: YHWH will guard your going out and your coming in").

This liturgical distribution reveals how Jewish tradition has understood Psalm 121: as a comprehensive prayer of protection applicable to daily vulnerability (bedtime), weekly transition (Shabbat), and life's journeys (travel prayers). The extraction of individual verses for insertion into other prayers demonstrates the tradition's recognition that the psalm's protective assurances retain their power even when detached from their original poetic context, functioning as portable theological affirmations of divine guardianship.
