I'd like you to help me plan a complex project. I'm a person interested in how contemporary AI technologies can be used to gain new insights into biblical texts. For this project I'm focusing on the book of psalms. I would like to create a pipeline that uses AI tools, texts that I can obtain for free and API calls in an agentic framework that together and create a rich commentary on each chapter of psalms.
For each chapter, I would like to use the sefaria API to obtain that chapter in the masoretic text and with English translation. I would like to then feed that text through the pipeline. When the work is complete, the pipeline should have produced a kind of study guide that includes an essay on the chapter as well as verse by verse commentary.

The reason that I think new technologies allow us to develop new insights is that large language models include embedded understandings of human language that scholars may not have had access to themselves. Also, these tools can process huge amounts of information while performing a task, something that might have taken scholars an enormous amount of time.
My thinking is that we could create a framework with multiple agents. 
The first agent might be provided with the chapter and perhaps some general tools and told that it will be asked to develop a high level and verse by verse commentary where the high level analysis will introduce a thesis which is then illustrated in the verse by verse commentary. The thesis will ideally posit and provide evidence for new insights into reading the chapter, or if not new, at least deep and illuminating insights that go beyond a surface reading of the chapter. These insights can include comments on the specific use of poetic devices like figuration, alliteration, parallelism, gapping, the "seconding" effect of poetic lines, etc, choice of certain words over others, choice of grammar and syntax.  The insight can also relate to things like the likely period of composition of the chapter, its cultic use, why it was composed, the type of work that it is (a work of praise, exhortation, polemics, wisdom, etcetera). The insight should also help a reader understand whether there is an emotional common narrative or other arc to the chapter. The insight would ideally help a person realize things about the chapter that they had never realized before.
The first agent will be told that it needs to make requests from librarian agents. These agents would specialize in different existing data sources. I'm not familiar with all the relevant APIs, but I know that sefaria has excellent APIs that are freely available; I'm hoping you can investigate which others we can use. Additionally, I have already used AI to create a figurative language detector through which I've processed all of the pentateuch and the book of psalms (see: "C:\Users\ariro\OneDrive\Documents\Bible\README_INTERNAL.md" and "C:\Users\ariro\OneDrive\Documents\Bible\database\Pentateuch_Psalms_fig_language.db"). So, for example, if the first agent requests an entry in the BDB related to each of 7 words that it finds interesting, as well as a request to search our database of figurative language for instances where ‘fire’ is used as a figurative vehicle, our librarian agents would then trigger Python scripts to retrieve the relevant information. All the requested information would then be packaged and provided to a second scholar agent whose job it would be to create the commentary. It may be that we want a third agent to prod the second agent to avoid cliche, go deeper, develop new insights, ask better questions, etcetera and then have the second agent redo some of its work. One technique might be to propose an idea, test it verse-by-verse, see if it holds up, and if not, develop a new idea.
Please propose a comprehensive high level plan for building this pipeline which we will then plan to run for the entire book of psalms. Keep in mind that we need to store output in some way, but ultimately I would like it to be formattable so that it can be printed chapter by chapter In Word documents that are professionally formatted and easy to read and use traditional Jewish modifications for the printing of divine names (see: "C:\Users\ariro\OneDrive\Documents\Bible\docs\NON_SACRED_HEBREW.md"). Also, To the extent possible I would like to use exclusively free resources for obtaining information. In terms of the actual AI agents, I would like to be as smart as possible in using both the best agents for the job but also keeping down costs. Claude haiku 4.5 was just released and it is relatively inexpensive compared to Claude sonnet 4.5. Perhaps we would want a pipeline where we use haiku for easier tasks and sonnet for ones requiring deeper analysis.
 Once You propose a high level plan we can iterate on it and refine it. Note the plan is to execute this together here in VS code _ GitHub at : https://github.com/ARobicsek/psalms-AI-analysis.
