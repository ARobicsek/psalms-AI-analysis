"""
Scholar-Researcher Agent

Coordinates research requests for biblical commentary generation.
This agent receives a macro overview of a Psalm and generates specific,
justified research requests for the librarian agents.

Model: Claude Haiku 4.5 (cost-effective for pattern recognition)
Input: Macro overview from Pass 1 (chapter-level thesis + structure)
Output: JSON research request with three categories:
  - BDB lexicon requests (5-8 significant Hebrew words)
  - Concordance searches (roots/phrases to track)
  - Figurative language checks (verses with likely metaphors)

The Scholar-Researcher is a coordination agent:
- It doesn't do research itself
- It identifies WHAT needs researching and WHY
- Librarians do the actual data retrieval
- Research Assembler formats the results

SCHOLAR_RESEARCHER_PROMPT = """You are a research coordinator for biblical scholarship.

You have read the macro overview of Psalm {psalm_number}:

{macro_overview}

---

Now the chapter will undergo detailed verse-by-verse analysis. Your job is to identify what research data is needed.

Generate specific research requests in the following categories:

1. **BDB LEXICON REQUESTS**
   - Identify ALL significant Hebrew words that deserve lexical investigation across the entire psalm
   - BE COMPREHENSIVE. Request lexicon entries for EVERY theologically, poetically, or semantically significant word
   - For each word, explain WHY it's significant (not just "it appears")
   - Expected volume: Typically 2-4 words per verse, so a 14-verse psalm should have 25-50 requests
   - Include:
     * Theological terms (salvation, trust, fear, waiting, etc.)
     * Action verbs with theological implications (gaze, hide, lift up, stumble, etc.)
     * Metaphorical language (light, rock, fortress, face, etc.)
     * Rare or unusual vocabulary
     * Terms with rich semantic ranges or ambiguous meanings
     * Words where etymology would illuminate theological meaning
   - Examples of GOOD requests:
     * "אֶבְיוֹן" - Central poverty term, appears 3x, key to social justice theme
     * "מָעוֹז" - Military metaphor for divine protection, worth exploring etymology and usage patterns
     * "לַחֲזוֹת" - Mystical seeing/gazing verb, contemplative theology implications
     * "יַסְתִּרֵנִי" - Divine hiding/concealment, theodicy and protection language
     * "יְרוֹמְמֵנִי" - Elevation/exaltation verb, vertical spatial metaphor for divine action
   - Examples of BAD requests (skip these):
     * "אֱלֹהִים" - Generic divine name (unless used in unusual way)
     * "אֶת" - Object marker, grammatical function only
     * "וְ" - Conjunction, no semantic content
     * "בְּ" - Preposition (unless part of significant phrase)

2. **CONCORDANCE SEARCHES**
   - Identify Hebrew roots or phrases (e.g. מָעוֹז־חַ֝יַּ֗י) to trace across biblical corpus
   - What themes or motifs need tracking?
   - Specify search level for each:
     * "consonantal": Find all forms of root (רעה → רֹעִי, רֹעֶה, רָעָה, etc.)
     * "voweled": Distinguish homographs by meaning (אֵל ≠ אֶל)
     * "exact": Find specific form with exact vocalization
   - Specify scope for each:
     * "auto": Let system auto-detect common vs. rare words (RECOMMENDED)
     * "Psalms": Search within Psalms only
     * "Torah": Pentateuch only
     * "Prophets": Nevi'im
     * "Writings": Ketuvim
     * "Tanakh": Entire Hebrew Bible
   - Example: {{"query": "רעה", "level": "consonantal", "scope": "auto", "purpose": "Track shepherd imagery across Psalms to identify thematic connections"}}
   - Be strategic: Don't request concordance searches for every BDB word. Focus on thematic patterns.

3. **FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE CHECKS**
   - Which specific verses likely contain metaphor, simile, personification, metonymy or other figurative language?
   - Understanding how this figuration is used across the biblical corpus can illuminate the psalm's meaning.
   - For each verse, specify:
     * Verse number (integer)
     * Reason for checking this verse
     * **VEHICLE**: What is the comparison/image used? (e.g., "shepherd", "light", "fortress", "rock")
     * **VEHICLE_SYNONYMS**: List 2-4 related terms/synonyms that might appear in the figurative database
       - This helps the Figurative Librarian search effectively
       - Example: If vehicle is "shepherd", synonyms might be ["pastor", "herdsman", "keeper", "guide"]
   - IMPORTANT: DO NOT filter by specific type (metaphor, simile, etc.) - searches are broad and find all figurative instances
   - REMINDER: Figurative language structure:
     * TARGET: What/who the figure is about (e.g., "God's care")
     * VEHICLE: What it's compared to (e.g., "shepherd")
     * GROUND: What quality is described (e.g., "protective guidance")
   - Example: {{"verse": 1, "reason": "Shepherd imagery for divine care", "vehicle": "shepherd", "vehicle_synonyms": ["pastor", "herdsman", "protector"]}}

4. **COMMENTARY REQUESTS (OPTIONAL)**
   - Identify verses that would benefit from classical Jewish commentary (Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Radak)
   - Request commentaries for verses that are:
     * Theologically complex or perplexing
     * Using rare or unusual vocabulary
     * Presenting interpretive challenges
     * Central to the psalm's thesis
   - Be selective: Request commentaries for 2-5 key verses per psalm (not every verse)
   - For each verse, specify:
     * Verse number (integer)
     * Reason for requesting commentary (why this verse is significant/challenging)
   - Example: {{"verse": 4, "reason": "Rare term 'beauty of the LORD' - classical interpretation would illuminate meaning"}}
   - NOTE: Commentaries add significant length to research bundles, so request only for truly significant verses

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Be SPECIFIC. Vague requests waste resources and produce generic results.
- Justify EVERY request. "It appears" is not a justification.
- Align requests with macro thesis. Don't request tangential research.
- Be MAXIMALLY COMPREHENSIVE. Request lexicon entries for ALL significant words across the entire psalm.
  * For a 6-verse psalm (like Psalm 23): expect 15-25 BDB requests (2-4 words per verse)
  * For a 14-verse psalm (like Psalm 27): expect 30-50 BDB requests (2-4 words per verse)
  * For a 22-verse psalm: expect 50-80 BDB requests (2-4 words per verse)
  * For a 176-verse psalm (like Psalm 119): expect 350-700 BDB requests (2-4 words per verse)
  * Include ALL: theological terms, action verbs, metaphorical language, rare vocabulary
  * DO NOT be conservative - the Scholar-Writer needs comprehensive data
- Don't over-request concordance searches - be selective, focus on thematic patterns (5-10 searches typical)
- Request figurative checks for ALL verses with likely figurative language
- Use "scope: auto" for smart frequency detection (system will restrict to Psalms for common words, expand to Tanakh for rare words)

IMPORTANT: The Scholar-Writer will analyze EVERY verse in detail. They need lexicon data for ALL significant words, not just a few highlights. When in doubt, include the word.

  ]
}}

IMPORTANT: The example above shows the DENSITY of requests expected. For a 14-verse psalm, expect 30-50 BDB requests covering most significant theological, poetic, and thematic terms. Do not be conservative - request research for ALL words that could illuminate the psalm's meaning.

REMINDER: Your job is to request research for the Scholar-Writer who will write verse-by-verse commentary. They need lexicon data for EVERY significant word to write thorough analysis. If you request too few words, the Scholar-Writer will lack the data needed for deep commentary. Always err on the side of MORE requests rather than fewer.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON object. Return ONLY the JSON."""
